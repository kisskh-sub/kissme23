00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.330
Huatao said

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.130
becoming a police officer was
his childhood dream.

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.980
And your dream was

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:08.180
to be an astronaut.

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:11.050
May your dream come true.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:09.020
[Episode 17]

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:15.380
There are multiple impact

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.170
injuries on the body's surface

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:19.610
and several rib fractures.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.850
His femoral artery appears

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:22.980
to have been severed.

00:04:23.950 --> 00:04:25.660
There are also multiple stab wounds

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.100
on the legs and abdomen.

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:30.980
The face and fingertips

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.370
are pale,

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.410
indicating he died from
excessive blood loss.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:35.980
Additionally,

00:04:36.430 --> 00:04:37.490
there's a small amount of

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:38.980
human tissue under his fingernails.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.460
The specific cause

00:04:40.630 --> 00:04:41.780
of death requires

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:42.900
further autopsy.

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:45.220
Mr. Han,

00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:50.780
we found a memory card.

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:57.700
Mr. Qi, Mr. Han,

00:04:58.510 --> 00:04:59.900
our preliminary judgment on the cause of

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.540
death is a gunshot

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.810
wound from the back of the head,

00:05:01.950 --> 00:05:02.850
which traversed the brain,

00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:04.220
and caused instant death.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:05.370
The victim's neck

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:06.340
shows dark red livor mortis.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:07.730
Time of death is preliminarily

00:05:07.750 --> 00:05:08.810
assessed at three hours ago.

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:12.100
Judging by the scene,

00:05:12.630 --> 00:05:14.900
the likely scenario is that the
perpetrator stabbed Wan,

00:05:15.190 --> 00:05:16.490
and Wan shot and killed him

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:17.980
just before he died.

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.020
When the femoral artery

00:06:22.070 --> 00:06:23.290
is severed,

00:06:23.510 --> 00:06:25.220
one loses a massive volume
of blood in a short time.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:26.050
Also,

00:06:26.310 --> 00:06:27.170
withdrawing the blade

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:29.100
can cause a spray pattern of blood.

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:30.930
But inside the car,

00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:32.290
neither the driver's

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.290
nor passenger's seat

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.220
has such a volume of blood.

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:36.980
Normally,

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.020
when one loses too much
blood in a short time,

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:40.900
they'll lose lucidity.

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.810
That man

00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:44.220
was nearly

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:45.730
ten meters away from Wan

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.490
and moving rapidly.

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.290
Under such circumstances,

00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:50.290
the probability

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.930
of Wan achieving a precise headshot

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.220
is extremely low.

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:05.140
Ms. Zhu!

00:07:35.120 --> 00:07:36.020
Why did you go up there?

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.100
If something happened to you,

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.050
how would I face Huatao?

00:07:43.430 --> 00:07:44.700
Huatao specifically asked me

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.700
to take good care of you

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:46.660
when he passed away.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:48.780
And now

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.610
you won't even listen

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:50.050
to me?

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:56.100
May your dream come true.

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:19.540
So that means,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:20.490
apart from

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:21.730
the two victims,

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:24.900
we have practically no leads.

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:26.610
You've been a detective
for a while, right?

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:28.050
We detectives need to base our words

00:08:28.070 --> 00:08:29.220
and actions on evidence.

00:08:29.310 --> 00:08:30.610
Be more discreet with your words, okay?

00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:31.980
Well, Ms. Zhu

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:32.490
insisted I

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:33.490
go on this mission with you.

00:08:34.030 --> 00:08:34.850
Nothing to complain about.

00:08:40.910 --> 00:08:41.490
Get to work.

00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:42.610
Get to work!

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:46.340
Gao Yuan!

00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:47.890
Ms. Zhu.

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:51.890
Samples taken?

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:52.490
Yes.

00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:55.980
Why are you looking at me?

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:56.770
Get to work!

00:08:57.550 --> 00:08:58.340
Get to work!

00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:32.370
Zhu!

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:33.770
Zhu, I'll be right back.

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.130
I have a surprise for you.

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:49.820
Mr. Han,

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:50.850
Mr. Qi,

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:52.100
we found

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.300
a scalpel on Wan.

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:56.820
(Hello, Mr. Han.)

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:57.730
Xiaoxi,

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:58.770
check if Wan visited

00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:59.530
the First People's

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:00.530
Hospital a few hours ago.

00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:01.460
(On it.)

00:10:03.030 --> 00:10:04.250
Go check if the deceased was from

00:10:04.390 --> 00:10:05.300
the First People's Hospital.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:05.940
Got it.

00:10:07.960 --> 00:10:08.340
Mr. Qi,

00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:09.940
no suspicious bloodstains

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.700
in other locations.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.010
That's strange.

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.010
An adult weighing

00:10:15.030 --> 00:10:16.180
around 85 kg

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:17.490
should have a blood volume

00:10:17.550 --> 00:10:19.060
of about 5 to 6 liters.

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:20.730
For someone of Wan's build,

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.460
it might be even higher.

00:10:23.270 --> 00:10:23.850
But

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:26.460
judging by the body's blood loss,

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.770
the blood at the scene

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.460
is less than half that amount.

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:30.610
So this isn't

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:31.580
the primary crime scene?

00:10:33.510 --> 00:10:34.770
Then where is the primary scene?

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:36.770
Logically,

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:37.980
after apprehending someone,

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.300
Wan should have informed us immediately

00:10:39.390 --> 00:10:40.340
or headed straight back.

00:10:40.910 --> 00:10:42.730
It only takes 20 minutes to drive from

00:10:43.030 --> 00:10:44.010
the hospital to the station.

00:10:44.390 --> 00:10:45.580
Why would he take a detour?

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.370
Unless something happened

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:49.530
that made Wan change his plans.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:53.820
Xiaoxi.

00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:54.980
(Mr. Han,)

00:10:55.550 --> 00:10:56.700
I found Wan's car.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.730
It was spotted at the

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.060
First People's Hospital four hours ago.

00:10:59.510 --> 00:11:00.180
Trace

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:01.340
Wan's movements.

00:11:01.750 --> 00:11:02.180
On it.

00:11:09.870 --> 00:11:10.370
Mr. Han,

00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:11.770
I've located a suspicious

00:11:11.840 --> 00:11:13.010
spot where Wan stopped.

00:11:14.390 --> 00:11:14.980
Found the possible

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:15.940
primary crime scene.

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.180
You stay and investigate.

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:18.100
Let's go.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:49.940
This should be

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:50.890
the primary crime scene.

00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.890
So Wan was transported

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.980
to the secondary scene

00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.460
only after he had bled out here.

00:11:58.150 --> 00:11:58.820
Mr. Han,

00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:00.700
a tire found here!

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:07.370
Mr. Han,

00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.250
over here.

00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:34.700
Hello, Gao Yuan.

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:35.650
Mr. Qi,

00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:36.980
through Luminol testing,

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:38.130
we discovered a large amount

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.370
of bloodstains in the back seat.

00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:42.820
Okay, understood.

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:10.530
You can take a few days off

00:13:10.550 --> 00:13:11.420
if you want.

00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:13.420
Just leave

00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:14.770
Wan's case to us.

00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:18.220
The entire precinct's resources

00:13:19.480 --> 00:13:20.220
are on it.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:22.530
I'm fine.

00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:25.060
I'll continue following Wan's case.

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.490
Everyone, let's focus.

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:00.610
Wan wouldn't want

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:01.340
to see us like this.

00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:02.180
Let's discuss.

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:06.850
We found multiple stab wounds

00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.420
and impact injuries

00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:11.650
on Wan's body.

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.220
Also, his three ribs

00:14:14.240 --> 00:14:14.890
were fractured.

00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:17.490
His wounds

00:14:17.510 --> 00:14:18.580
include abdominal stab wounds,

00:14:19.150 --> 00:14:19.650
but these

00:14:19.670 --> 00:14:20.460
weren't fatal.

00:14:21.120 --> 00:14:22.100
The fatal injury was caused

00:14:22.510 --> 00:14:23.340
by the severing of

00:14:23.360 --> 00:14:24.220
the femoral artery;

00:14:24.440 --> 00:14:25.340
then he bled out to death.

00:14:25.870 --> 00:14:26.850
Wound comparison confirms

00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:28.060
it was caused by the scalpel

00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:29.250
found at the scene.

00:14:29.630 --> 00:14:30.250
Furthermore,

00:14:30.550 --> 00:14:31.580
we found gunshot residue

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.940
on Wan's hands

00:14:33.670 --> 00:14:34.530
and some dander tissue

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.220
under his fingernails.

00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.130
DNA results are

00:14:37.150 --> 00:14:38.130
still being compared.

00:14:38.870 --> 00:14:39.940
As for the other victim's

00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:40.650
cause of death,

00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:41.770
it was a gunshot to the back of

00:14:41.790 --> 00:14:42.890
the head that traversed the brain.

00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:44.300
Technical comparison confirms

00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:45.340
the bullet was fired

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.250
from Wan's gun.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:47.890
The deceased is named Cui Hao,

00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.980
a doctor at the First People's Hospital

00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.300
primarily responsible
for drug supervision

00:14:52.320 --> 00:14:53.420
and inventory management.

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.650
While investigating Cui Hao,

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:57.340
we learned Wan was also looking

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.300
into the inventory

00:14:58.320 --> 00:14:59.890
of drugs like ether and cedilanid

00:14:59.910 --> 00:15:00.770
at that hospital.

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:02.580
He found Cui Hao was a key suspect,

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:04.300
so he brought him in for questioning.

00:15:04.670 --> 00:15:06.370
Isn't cedilanid the drug

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:07.730
that caused Li Yiqi's death?

00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.770
Do you remember

00:15:10.550 --> 00:15:11.650
during Wang Chen's autopsy,

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.060
a lot of ether was

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:13.820
found in his system?

00:15:14.360 --> 00:15:16.490
So, Cui Hao is connected to the suspect

00:15:16.510 --> 00:15:17.130
from the hospital.

00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:21.730
Look at this,

00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:24.580
this drug bottle

00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:25.850
was found at Cui Hao's home.

00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:26.820
This drug's

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:28.180
composition is very similar

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.490
to the one that Li Shuting,

00:15:29.510 --> 00:15:30.370
Xiao Lin, and Song had.

00:15:30.790 --> 00:15:32.060
All contain antidepressant components.

00:15:32.790 --> 00:15:34.010
That means Cui Hao had

00:15:34.150 --> 00:15:35.370
some kind of transaction

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.460
with the hospital suspect.

00:15:37.960 --> 00:15:38.700
What else?

00:15:39.440 --> 00:15:40.130
The person who killed

00:15:40.150 --> 00:15:41.300
Cui Hao might not be Wan.

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:42.580
There might have been

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.650
a third person at the scene.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.770
A large amount of wiped blood

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:46.530
residue was found

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:48.060
in the vehicle at the secondary scene.

00:15:48.550 --> 00:15:49.340
Also, a large amount

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.820
of blood was found at the primary scene.

00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.010
All this blood

00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.820
belongs solely to Wan.

00:15:54.390 --> 00:15:54.940
Therefore,

00:15:55.150 --> 00:15:56.180
Wan was likely already

00:15:56.510 --> 00:15:58.220
unconscious or dead

00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:00.490
from massive blood loss before

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:02.130
reaching the secondary scene.

00:16:02.670 --> 00:16:04.370
He was then moved to the secondary scene

00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:06.100
by the real killer and Cui Hao.

00:16:07.240 --> 00:16:08.610
After positioning Wan,

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:10.580
the killer chose to kill Cui Hao

00:16:11.030 --> 00:16:12.730
so that his identity
wouldn't be exposed.

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:17.700
After the murder,

00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.340
he staged the scene to create

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:21.100
the illusion that Wan killed Cui Hao.

00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:27.730
We found puncture marks

00:16:27.750 --> 00:16:28.650
on a tire at

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.850
the secondary crime scene.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:31.530
That explains why

00:16:31.550 --> 00:16:32.610
Wan stopped midway.

00:16:33.750 --> 00:16:34.940
Judging from the braking marks

00:16:35.270 --> 00:16:36.610
and Wan's injuries,

00:16:36.870 --> 00:16:37.700
it can be inferred that

00:16:38.720 --> 00:16:39.850
an accident occurred on his way

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:40.940
back to the station

00:16:41.030 --> 00:16:41.940
with Cui Hao.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:44.340
At that moment,

00:16:44.550 --> 00:16:46.100
a third person arrived at the scene.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:17.290
Xiaoxi,

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:18.940
keep checking the hospital

00:17:19.350 --> 00:17:20.290
footage for new leads.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:21.460
- Okay.
- Ms. Zhu,

00:17:26.680 --> 00:17:27.380
we're here for you.

00:17:54.350 --> 00:17:55.250
Give me the gun!

00:17:58.960 --> 00:17:59.530
Go!

00:18:00.350 --> 00:18:01.420
Get out of here!

00:18:03.110 --> 00:18:04.140
Go!

00:19:07.510 --> 00:19:08.380
Come on in.

00:19:09.550 --> 00:19:10.900
Everyone,

00:19:11.270 --> 00:19:11.900
attention.

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:13.810
Let's all welcome

00:19:13.830 --> 00:19:15.490
our new colleague,

00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:16.660
Ms. Zhu Qingyue!

00:19:48.310 --> 00:19:49.090
Zhu?

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:58.220
Tell Ms. Zhu

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.700
I'm going out for a bit.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:16.900
Mr. Qi,

00:20:18.070 --> 00:20:19.380
here's Chen Chuchuan's clinic

00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:20.010
patient list.

00:20:20.830 --> 00:20:21.900
Here are his prescribed drugs.

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:24.530
I'll test them now.

00:20:24.750 --> 00:20:25.140
Okay.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:36.770
Mr. Qi,

00:20:38.030 --> 00:20:38.810
four of these are

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:39.980
related to the new drug.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:48.490
(All were for depression.)

00:20:56.110 --> 00:20:56.570
Ms. Zhu,

00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.660
I found the suspect

00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.730
with the tattoo on his neck.

00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.140
He was at the hospital then,

00:21:01.750 --> 00:21:03.140
constantly watching Wan and Cui Hao.

00:21:03.750 --> 00:21:04.700
He's the one who tampered

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:05.460
with Wan's car.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:11.980
Don't move!

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.490
Still say you did nothing,

00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:18.090
huh?

00:21:30.590 --> 00:21:31.620
Check the surveillance

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:34.220
and see where he went and

00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:35.660
the routes he took.

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:36.380
Okay.

00:21:57.480 --> 00:21:58.290
(If the tattooed man)

00:21:58.310 --> 00:21:59.900
(killed Cui Hao and Wan)

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:02.380
(because Wan discovered)

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.730
(their drug dealing,)

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:07.010
(his target should have been Cui Hao.)

00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:10.460
(Wan's death was likely an accident.)

00:22:15.240 --> 00:22:15.770
What about him?

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:17.290
Yes,

00:22:17.510 --> 00:22:18.420
that's the man.

00:22:18.920 --> 00:22:19.980
You just said

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.570
they were arguing.

00:22:22.440 --> 00:22:23.460
(The tattooed man and)

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.620
(Wang Chen were partners.)

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:26.380
(So what was his motive for)

00:22:26.400 --> 00:22:27.140
(silencing Wang Chen?)

00:22:32.110 --> 00:22:32.570
Where

00:22:33.270 --> 00:22:34.250
did you get this medicine?

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.220
Wang Chen gave it to me.

00:22:37.030 --> 00:22:38.010
Everyone in our group

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:38.980
has it.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.860
(Wang Chen was the source for)

00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.180
(new drug test samples.)

00:22:44.030 --> 00:22:45.660
(But he was under police investigation)

00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.940
(because of Zhai Xixi's death.)

00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:49.490
(So the tattooed man killed Wang Chen)

00:22:49.680 --> 00:22:50.220
(to)

00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:52.460
(cut off the police
investigation leads.)

00:22:57.310 --> 00:22:58.700
(Li Yiqi must have been)

00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:00.010
(using the new drug at the time.)

00:23:01.070 --> 00:23:02.810
(The tattooed man was afraid the police)

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:04.090
(would trace the drug's source,)

00:23:04.830 --> 00:23:05.980
(so he silenced him)

00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:07.010
(before he could)

00:23:07.310 --> 00:23:08.420
(tell the truth.)

00:23:10.070 --> 00:23:10.900
(These deaths)

00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:12.220
(are all connected to the new drug.)

00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.050
Four of these

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:14.220
are related to the new drug.

00:23:15.480 --> 00:23:17.010
(All were for depression.)

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:18.860
(Chen Chuchuan used
his psychology clinic)

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:20.010
(to find test samples,)

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:25.810
(so he's likely also
one of the sources.)

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:28.570
(And now that Chen Chuchuan is)

00:23:28.590 --> 00:23:29.980
(exposed to the police,)

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:32.220
(he is probably)

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:34.220
(the tattooed man's)

00:23:34.270 --> 00:23:35.460
(next target.)

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:50.900
Hello?

00:23:52.790 --> 00:23:53.330
Okay, got it.

00:23:54.000 --> 00:23:54.290
Mr. Han,

00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:55.380
we received a tip.

00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:56.570
Chen Chuchuan's car seems to

00:23:56.590 --> 00:23:57.220
be heading towards

00:23:57.240 --> 00:23:58.250
the border town of Luowang.

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.330
Chen Chuchuan,

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:43.490
I did so much

00:24:43.510 --> 00:24:45.180
for you fourteen years ago,

00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:46.700
and now I can't even get

00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.140
a painting from you?

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.770
I've told you a thousand

00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.460
times now.

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.620
I can't paint it!

00:24:51.720 --> 00:24:52.700
So you're forcing me to

00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:53.490
tell the police the

00:24:53.510 --> 00:24:54.770
truth about what you did, is that it?

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:55.770
I don't care!

00:24:55.790 --> 00:24:56.860
Do you know how I've

00:24:56.880 --> 00:24:57.980
spent these 14 years?

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.380
In constant pain

00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:00.900
and regret!

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.940
I caused Jiangxue's death!

00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:03.980
It was me!

00:25:04.310 --> 00:25:05.180
Chen Chuchuan,

00:25:05.920 --> 00:25:07.900
are you still only caring
about Fan Jiangxue

00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:08.460
now?

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.010
You think what you know

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:12.220
is the whole truth?

00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:13.180
I'll tell you.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:14.330
I'll let you know

00:25:14.350 --> 00:25:16.290
how Fan Jiangxue died!

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:19.860
I got the flowers

00:25:19.880 --> 00:25:21.380
she was allergic to and put them there!

00:25:21.590 --> 00:25:22.810
I wanted her dead!

00:25:25.590 --> 00:25:26.250
Why?

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.010
Why did you do that!

00:25:28.310 --> 00:25:29.180
Seeing you two

00:25:29.200 --> 00:25:30.140
together back then

00:25:30.270 --> 00:25:31.570
made me so jealous!

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:32.810
But why!

00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:34.050
I wanted her dead!

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:35.140
Why did you kill her?

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:36.380
You killed her!

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.490
Why!

00:26:05.270 --> 00:26:05.940
Help me...

00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:06.730
I didn't mean to!

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.570
Hu Jie! Hu...

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:08.220
Hu Jie!

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:09.770
I didn't mean to, Hu Jie!

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:10.570
Hu Jie!

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:11.730
Hu Jie!

00:26:12.590 --> 00:26:13.090
Hu Jie!

00:27:11.880 --> 00:27:12.900
I'm sorry, Jiangxue.

00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:16.050
It was all my fault.

00:27:17.830 --> 00:27:18.770
It was all my fault.

00:28:07.830 --> 00:28:08.330
Chuchuan?

00:28:09.790 --> 00:28:10.290
Chen Chuchuan!

00:28:10.350 --> 00:28:10.980
I can save her!

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:12.010
Fan Jiangxue is gone!

00:28:12.110 --> 00:28:13.380
I can save her!

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:17.220
Wake up!

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:18.730
Chen Chuchuan, wake up!

00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.220
Wake up!

00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:23.770
She's already dead.

00:28:24.550 --> 00:28:25.420
She can't be saved.

00:28:25.750 --> 00:28:26.770
If the police find out,

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:28.490
your life is over.

00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:30.420
You'll have no future,

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:31.010
you know?

00:28:31.240 --> 00:28:31.810
I can save her.

00:28:32.110 --> 00:28:33.420
You'll have no future!

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.180
I can save her.

00:28:35.310 --> 00:28:35.980
Just trust me.

00:28:36.680 --> 00:28:37.090
Trust me.

00:28:37.720 --> 00:28:38.940
I'll handle this for you.

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:40.490
You need to leave.

00:28:41.400 --> 00:28:41.980
Just go.

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:51.420
Mr. Bai,

00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:53.620
a vehicle matching

00:29:53.750 --> 00:29:54.730
the description of the one

00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.420
that hit Ms. Zhu at the hospital

00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.730
was found at a highway intersection

00:29:58.750 --> 00:29:59.700
five kilometers from Luowang.

00:30:00.070 --> 00:30:00.940
It must be the suspect's.

00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:02.620
Notify Han Feng

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:04.140
to arrest him immediately.

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:05.140
Yes, sir.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:28.380
Chuan,

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:29.220
it's all set.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:29.860
Let's go.

00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:13.220
How much longer to the border?

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:14.700
Chuan,

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:15.660
take a nap.

00:31:16.270 --> 00:31:17.010
We'll be there soon.

00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:49.660
Where are we?

00:31:53.310 --> 00:31:53.770
We arrived.

00:31:55.200 --> 00:31:55.900
Where?

00:34:20.640 --> 00:34:22.380
The trauma from mental illness

00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.490
is far greater than the pain
from physical illness.

00:34:24.510 --> 00:34:24.980
Promise me

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:26.130
you'll become an outstanding

00:34:26.150 --> 00:34:27.020
forensic pathologist.

00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:28.580
I never called him "brother".

00:34:28.680 --> 00:34:30.660
Now that I want to, he
can't hear me anymore.

00:34:30.710 --> 00:34:32.300
Wan would be more than
happy to hear that.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:34.260
Provincial task force
is already en route.

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.650
We need to eradicate

00:34:35.710 --> 00:34:36.650
this new drug with

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:37.570
the utmost speed.

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:39.740
Based on the extracted
fingerprints and tissue,

00:34:39.760 --> 00:34:41.690
we can now confirm the
suspect's name is Wang Bo.

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:42.940
The Raw Diamond Case...

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:43.610
I misjudged it.

00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:44.820
Then we'll investigate it

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.380
and find the real killer of Fei.

00:34:47.230 --> 00:34:47.820
Freeze!
