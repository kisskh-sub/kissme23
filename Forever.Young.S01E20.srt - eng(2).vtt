WEBVTT

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.680
Come on, come on!

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.439
Here.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.199
Listen.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.360
I've already severely criticized Ma Weiguo.

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:12.800
He's also deeply realized his mistake.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.520
Crying and sniveling.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.120
Kept begging me to apologize to you for him.

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.000
So, about this love letter thing...

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.159
I think we should just let it go.

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:21.719
You're so full of it.

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:22.560
I...

00:02:23.719 --> 00:02:25.680
But I really didn't expect...

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.400
It really was Weiguo who wrote it.

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.680
How could that kid be so rotten?

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:31.120
Exactly!

00:02:31.280 --> 00:02:33.400
If only you had told me back then,

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:36.120
this misunderstanding wouldn't have lasted all these years.

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.520
What a missed opportunity.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.879
What missed opportunity?

00:02:46.319 --> 00:02:48.439
Look, the misunderstanding is cleared up now.

00:02:48.439 --> 00:02:51.199
Why don't we give it another try?

00:02:51.439 --> 00:02:52.919
What are you doing?

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:54.319
There are so many people.

00:02:58.719 --> 00:03:00.759
No, didn't I tell you?

00:03:01.199 --> 00:03:03.599
Let's not complicate our relationship.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.639
If you have something to say, just say it.

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:10.439
Alright, alright, let's get down to business.

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.000
From now on, matters regarding Peng Le Xuan

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.199
will be handled by me.

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:18.840
But let me warn you,

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:20.680
don't celebrate too soon.

00:03:21.159 --> 00:03:23.080
Even though I've agreed to this,

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:25.000
it still has to get past my boss.

00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:26.680
What?

00:03:26.719 --> 00:03:28.879
He doesn't know you like I do.

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:30.680
He might be a bit difficult.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:33.120
Don't worry.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.879
I'm prepared for how to talk to your boss.

00:03:34.879 --> 00:03:36.000
I've got it all ready.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:36.879
You,

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:39.120
just need to coordinate his schedule.

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:40.879
Prepared?

00:03:41.319 --> 00:03:42.439
Come on, let's hear it.

00:03:42.439 --> 00:03:43.120
No, no.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:44.479
What I mean is,

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:46.159
you absolutely must not get involved.

00:03:46.439 --> 00:03:47.599
If your boss sees you,

00:03:47.599 --> 00:03:49.439
he'll think we're in cahoots.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.319
Just wait outside for my good news.

00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.000
Li Lianbao.

00:03:56.319 --> 00:03:58.439
Don't mess this up.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.840
If this doesn't work out,

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:01.680
it'll be hard to get another meeting with him.

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:04.439
Don't you trust me to handle things?

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:06.080
Actually, I really don't.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.439
My water! Why are you drinking it?

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:13.479
How can I drink it after you?

00:04:13.479 --> 00:04:15.960
Seriously? You care about that?

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:18.879
You're so annoying.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.600
What?

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.720
What's wrong with taking a sip?

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.639
No.

00:04:22.519 --> 00:04:23.639
So stingy.

00:04:23.639 --> 00:04:24.680
Go buy your own.

00:04:24.759 --> 00:04:27.879
Hello, the number you have dialed is not in service.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.160
He changed his number.

00:04:29.879 --> 00:04:31.759
Why didn't he tell anyone he changed his number?

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:37.519
Seven, nine, five, seven, two.

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:46.240
Brother Tie, it's me...

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.160
You're looking for Lao Tie?

00:04:47.519 --> 00:04:47.839
He...

00:04:47.839 --> 00:04:48.360
I...

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.720
He's been gone for a while now.

00:04:52.519 --> 00:04:53.040
What happened?

00:04:53.040 --> 00:04:54.920
He just suddenly collapsed at work.

00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.480
Collapsed at the company?

00:04:58.079 --> 00:04:59.600
Please, don't get upset, calm down.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:01.399
Please, accept my condolences.

00:05:02.279 --> 00:05:03.920
I'm sorry, I'm so sorry.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.360
Gone in his fifties.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:15.959
Why work yourself so hard?

00:05:44.839 --> 00:05:45.639
Come on.

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:49.079
Come on.

00:06:11.639 --> 00:06:12.560
Brother Li.

00:06:17.959 --> 00:06:18.839
Feifei.

00:06:19.319 --> 00:06:20.319
So...

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:22.680
Dad needs to ask you a favor.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:23.680
Look.

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:25.000
Our Peng Le Xuan

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:26.439
is about to open soon.

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:28.879
I want to start a social media account.

00:06:28.879 --> 00:06:30.600
Record some daily life stuff and things,

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.439
to promote our Peng Le Xuan.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:34.800
You see, you're pretty good

00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.040
at planning and that sort of thing.

00:06:36.279 --> 00:06:38.240
Could you help your dad out?

00:06:39.519 --> 00:06:40.720
I won't make you do it for free.

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.120
I'll pay you.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.959
Okay?

00:06:43.839 --> 00:06:46.160
Will Mom agree to this?

00:06:46.639 --> 00:06:48.319
Your mom will definitely agree.

00:06:48.319 --> 00:06:49.040
Alright?

00:06:51.279 --> 00:06:51.920
Really.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:53.360
Wait, what's your answer?

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:55.279
Do you agree or not?

00:06:55.759 --> 00:06:56.480
Dad.

00:06:57.079 --> 00:06:58.000
If you have something to say,

00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.680
you can really just say it directly.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.680
No need to beat around the bush.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.800
Look at you these past couple days,

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:03.240
finding all sorts of roundabout reasons.

00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:04.560
No, what am I doing?

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.360
So I'm beating around the bush?

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.000
I know.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.639
You just want to apologize to me, right?

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.160
Have you realized that before,

00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:12.480
your parenting methods were problematic?

00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:13.920
Do you know you shouldn't have hit me?

00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:15.279
You need to communicate with me as an equal.

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:16.360
Just say it directly.

00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:18.800
No, why would I apologize to you?

00:07:22.279 --> 00:07:23.399
This matter...

00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:25.600
Can we see through it without spelling it out?

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:26.560
Is this fun?

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:27.519
It's fine.

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.240
I understand, alright.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:34.759
But you want me to run this social media account.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.560
Aren't you worried I'll neglect my studies?

00:07:36.560 --> 00:07:37.519
And mess up getting into university?

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:39.279
No. If you're capable,

00:07:39.279 --> 00:07:40.839
you won't mess up getting into university,

00:07:40.839 --> 00:07:42.600
and you'll still help me out.

00:07:42.759 --> 00:07:43.879
Help when you have time.

00:07:43.879 --> 00:07:45.560
If you don't have time, forget it. Okay?

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:48.680
I know.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:52.040
Right now, for the time being,

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:53.240
you can't find your own direction.

00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.480
That's normal.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:57.120
I'll be with you, and we'll look for it together.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:59.199
Until you find your own direction.

00:07:59.199 --> 00:08:00.040
Okay?

00:08:03.759 --> 00:08:04.759
Then wait for me a moment.

00:08:06.079 --> 00:08:06.879
Where are you going?

00:08:10.439 --> 00:08:11.000
Hello.

00:08:11.439 --> 00:08:13.240
Two, please. Vanilla flavor.

00:08:13.639 --> 00:08:14.439
Take them yourself.

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.079
Alright.

00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:17.160
You scan my code.

00:08:23.399 --> 00:08:24.199
That's so expensive

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:27.759
Wait, I thought you didn't like this anymore?

00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:29.000
Well, I like it again now.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.399
Take it. It's on me.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.519
Let's go sit over there to eat. Come on.

00:08:45.159 --> 00:08:46.440
It's nice and cool here.

00:08:50.039 --> 00:08:50.639
Dad.

00:08:51.279 --> 00:08:53.080
Even though I haven't decided yet

00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:54.279
whether to take the college entrance exam,

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.159
but at least

00:08:55.159 --> 00:08:55.720
I mean,

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.000
I'm willing to start studying hard.

00:08:59.799 --> 00:09:01.000
I think you're right.

00:09:01.399 --> 00:09:03.440
Whether going to college is meaningful or not

00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:05.440
is something I can think about after I get in.

00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:07.159
Thinking about it now is useless, right?

00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:09.360
That's the spirit.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.360
But... but you,

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.440
how did you suddenly figure it out?

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:13.600
You know why?

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.320
I'm afraid you'll slap me again.

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:16.559
Oh, cut it out.

00:09:16.679 --> 00:09:18.039
I promised you,

00:09:18.279 --> 00:09:20.440
I won't lay a hand on you again.

00:09:22.759 --> 00:09:23.320
Dad.

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:26.279
Actually, I've been wanting to tell you,

00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.279
it's because of you

00:09:29.159 --> 00:09:30.519
that I figured it out.

00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:34.799
Because of me what?

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:39.320
To be honest, I really didn't expect

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.759
you could win the Roast Duck King title.

00:09:40.759 --> 00:09:42.960
The Folk Duck King Cooking Contest

00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.639
champion is Wang Chunsheng.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.080
I was in the audience then,

00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:48.480
watching you roast the duck.

00:09:48.679 --> 00:09:50.679
I genuinely thought you looked so handsome,

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:51.799
so cool.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:54.000
That's when I understood.

00:09:54.559 --> 00:09:55.399
Actually,

00:09:55.519 --> 00:09:56.879
doing something well

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.000
isn't important.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.440
But putting in the effort to do something well

00:10:00.559 --> 00:10:01.559
is very important.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.919
Sign me up right now.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.279
I'll make roast duck

00:10:05.279 --> 00:10:07.919
and represent Peng Le Xuan in the Duck King contest.

00:10:10.480 --> 00:10:11.480
Put that down. Let your dad try.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.799
No, take it away, take it away!

00:10:17.879 --> 00:10:19.080
Before I've figured out

00:10:19.080 --> 00:10:20.639
what I want to do myself,

00:10:20.639 --> 00:10:22.519
I have to be ready at all times.

00:10:22.639 --> 00:10:23.799
Otherwise, what if one day

00:10:23.799 --> 00:10:24.919
I finally decide what I want to do,

00:10:24.919 --> 00:10:26.039
and only then start trying hard?

00:10:26.039 --> 00:10:27.200
Wouldn't that be too late?

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.639
Let me tell you,

00:10:29.639 --> 00:10:30.320
right now,

00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.919
you first get that bachelor's degree.

00:10:32.039 --> 00:10:34.039
It'll lay a foundation for the future.

00:10:34.519 --> 00:10:37.039
Can we not talk about the bachelor's degree?

00:10:37.159 --> 00:10:37.960
Just tell me,

00:10:38.159 --> 00:10:40.360
are you willing to get along with me like before?

00:10:40.919 --> 00:10:41.679
Get along?

00:10:42.159 --> 00:10:44.039
I'm telling you, we have a long road ahead.

00:10:44.039 --> 00:10:45.279
You just get along,

00:10:45.799 --> 00:10:47.159
and after a while, you'll realize

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:49.519
this dad of yours is a good dad.

00:10:49.879 --> 00:10:51.080
And after a while, you'll also know

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.519
this son of yours is definitely a good son too.

00:10:56.399 --> 00:10:59.480
Qiu'er, how did the talk go?

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.840
Let me know if there are any issues, okay?

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:03.960
Keep it up.

00:11:05.799 --> 00:11:07.159
Hello, Uncle Qiu'er.

00:11:07.159 --> 00:11:08.759
Can you stop relying so much on Uncle Ma?

00:11:08.759 --> 00:11:09.879
You're a grown adult.

00:11:09.879 --> 00:11:10.799
You're an adult.

00:11:10.799 --> 00:11:12.759
You need to learn to solve your own problems.

00:11:12.759 --> 00:11:13.879
He has his own things to deal with.

00:11:13.879 --> 00:11:14.799
That's all. Bye.

00:11:16.799 --> 00:11:18.080
You're meddling too much, aren't you?

00:11:19.039 --> 00:11:20.799
Look at the state you're in right now.

00:11:20.799 --> 00:11:22.080
And you still have time to worry about others?

00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:24.279
I booked a therapist for you.

00:11:24.279 --> 00:11:25.120
Charges by the hour.

00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:25.679
Come with me, quick.

00:11:25.679 --> 00:11:26.919
I never asked you to book one.

00:11:27.759 --> 00:11:29.120
There are so many people in this alley.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.360
Why are you only pestering me?

00:11:30.799 --> 00:11:32.000
Yes, so many people.

00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:33.799
But which one of them is sick like you?

00:11:34.159 --> 00:11:35.799
If a stray cat or dog on the street got sick

00:11:35.799 --> 00:11:36.360
and I found out about it,

00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:37.679
I'd still take care of it.

00:11:38.519 --> 00:11:39.279
What?

00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:42.039
I transferred the consultation fee to you.

00:11:42.039 --> 00:11:42.919
Consider it as if I went.

00:11:49.799 --> 00:11:50.399
Fine.

00:12:11.919 --> 00:12:13.200
Let me be straight with you.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.679
Our company's staff meals

00:12:15.679 --> 00:12:18.559
are provided by a restaurant owned by the big boss's brother-in-law.

00:12:21.879 --> 00:12:23.759
Who dares to change that, you tell me?

00:12:28.799 --> 00:12:29.919
Manager Tong.

00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:32.720
I came to you to discuss wealth management.

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:34.720
Why are you talking to me about a roast duck restaurant?

00:12:34.799 --> 00:12:36.279
How unprofessional is that?

00:12:36.279 --> 00:12:37.600
No, don't get upset.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.639
I just mentioned it in passing.

00:12:40.159 --> 00:12:42.279
If you raise the base interest rate a bit more for me,

00:12:42.279 --> 00:12:43.720
I'll give you all of our

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.519
business banquet catering.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:47.639
No, this is something I really have no say over.

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:49.679
Then forget it.

00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:54.120
What kind of request is that?

00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:55.480
Do you own the bank?

00:13:04.840 --> 00:13:05.720
What's going on?

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:07.200
How come you can't close a single deal?

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:33.000
Should I shoot from this side to that side,

00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.360
or from that side to this side?

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:35.120
Let's try both.

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.559
First... first, let's do it like this.

00:13:37.879 --> 00:13:39.000
Don't talk.

00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.120
Bro.

00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:42.360
You, don't talk yet.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.240
Uncle Qiu'er.

00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:46.679
This is yet another new day.

00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:50.600
Peng Le Xuan is bathed in sunshine.

00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:53.240
You're in the shot.

00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:54.360
Look, just look.

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:55.919
Bro, where's sister-in-law?

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:58.600
Sister-in-law is at home cooking.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:00.919
I need to tell you something.

00:14:00.919 --> 00:14:02.279
I... these past few days, I've really...

00:14:02.399 --> 00:14:03.919
visited quite a few clients.

00:14:03.919 --> 00:14:05.399
It's actually pretty tough.

00:14:05.519 --> 00:14:07.519
It's not that I haven't... haven't tried, bro.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:10.240
Yeah.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:12.120
You... you're fighting on two fronts now.

00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.720
It really isn't easy, right?

00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:14.720
Managing the bank over there,

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:16.120
and still having to look after the shop here.

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:16.600
Right.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:17.600
Look how tired my Qiu'er is.

00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:17.879
Yeah.

00:14:17.879 --> 00:14:19.480
Can you help me talk to Weiguo...

00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:21.240
No, don't talk, don't talk.

00:14:21.240 --> 00:14:21.679
I'll go from this side...

00:14:21.679 --> 00:14:23.120
from this side to that side for one take.

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.759
Don't move your feet, don't move your feet. Go.

00:14:28.840 --> 00:14:31.480
This is yet another new day at Peng Le Xuan.

00:14:32.039 --> 00:14:33.919
Sunshine is bright.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:39.080
Good.

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:39.879
This one's good.

00:14:39.879 --> 00:14:40.559
This is great.

00:14:40.559 --> 00:14:42.200
Because the sunlight is good.

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:42.960
Look.

00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:44.559
See?

00:14:47.159 --> 00:14:48.039
This is good, right?

00:14:48.399 --> 00:14:49.039
Send it to me.

00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:51.519
Click... click here, send.

00:14:51.519 --> 00:14:52.279
Send.

00:14:52.399 --> 00:14:53.159
Got it.

00:14:53.159 --> 00:14:54.600
Alright, bro, I'm heading off first.

00:14:54.799 --> 00:14:55.399
Okay.

00:14:55.399 --> 00:14:56.279
Bye, Uncle Qiu'er.

00:14:56.279 --> 00:14:58.159
Wait, what were you saying just now? What was it?

00:14:58.639 --> 00:15:00.399
Nothing, nothing. You're busy.

00:15:01.039 --> 00:15:01.919
Come by when you're free.

00:15:01.919 --> 00:15:02.600
Will do.

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:03.120
This software...

00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:04.879
is better, easier to use than your previous one.

00:15:04.879 --> 00:15:06.120
See, just click here.

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.600
Darn it, it directly reads it over.

00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:09.039
Click here, start editing.

00:15:09.039 --> 00:15:10.799
Freely, splice.

00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:13.039
I can then adjust to a warmer color.

00:15:13.039 --> 00:15:13.919
Right?

00:15:14.159 --> 00:15:15.039
Click this.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.240
Let me tell you.

00:15:25.799 --> 00:15:27.679
Marketing is about strategy.

00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:29.480
It's about having a clear target.

00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:31.279
Just talking randomly definitely won't work.

00:15:33.639 --> 00:15:35.799
Look at my four-quadrant method.

00:15:36.399 --> 00:15:39.519
The horizontal axis is client development progress.

00:15:39.639 --> 00:15:41.639
The further right, the more in-depth.

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:45.120
The vertical axis is client development potential.

00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:47.320
The higher up, the greater the potential.

00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:50.600
Got it?

00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:52.840
Take a good look.

00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:54.600
Alright.

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.720
I'll definitely study it carefully tomorrow.

00:15:58.240 --> 00:15:59.360
Don't!

00:15:59.879 --> 00:16:01.399
Let's do it right now, since we said we would.

00:16:01.519 --> 00:16:02.399
Right now?

00:16:03.559 --> 00:16:04.440
Hurry up.

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:07.120
I'm currently organizing...

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.919
this proposal for Boss Dong.

00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:10.480
You're here, perfect.

00:16:10.840 --> 00:16:11.840
Let's work on it together.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.120
If there are any issues,

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.480
we can communicate promptly.

00:16:15.799 --> 00:16:16.519
Okay.

00:16:24.799 --> 00:16:26.320
You look at it first, I'll make a call.

00:16:26.320 --> 00:16:26.799
Okay.

00:16:33.919 --> 00:16:35.320
Hello, Brother Liu.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.840
I'll send you a set of data in a bit.

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:39.399
Help me verify it.

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.639
Yes, yes, yes. It's needed very urgently.

00:16:41.720 --> 00:16:44.240
So, tonight you'll have to put in some extra effort.

00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.000
Work overtime.

00:16:46.399 --> 00:16:47.799
Alright then, I'll hang up now.

00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:21.640
Go wash your face, wake up a bit.

00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:43.839
Bro.

00:17:45.839 --> 00:17:48.240
I used to think your job was pretty easy.

00:17:49.119 --> 00:17:50.839
Just eating and drinking with people,

00:17:50.839 --> 00:17:52.119
shooting the breeze was all it took.

00:17:52.119 --> 00:17:54.759
Didn't expect it to be such a rat race.

00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:58.759
This is just the beginning.

00:17:59.680 --> 00:18:01.440
Back when I was at the company,

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.799
to hit the key performance indicators,

00:18:03.039 --> 00:18:05.440
I pulled a 997 schedule for three months straight.

00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:11.039
Didn't expect that, did you?

00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:12.720
That's how intense the rat race is.

00:18:13.279 --> 00:18:14.480
That's how thrilling it is.

00:18:14.759 --> 00:18:16.000
If you don't fight hard,

00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:17.240
you won't even get a chance.

00:18:21.799 --> 00:18:25.319
Yeah, I don't have your capability.

00:18:26.559 --> 00:18:28.039
I'm going to sleep for a bit first.

00:18:29.519 --> 00:18:30.240
No, no, no.

00:18:30.359 --> 00:18:32.279
Let me see that spreadsheet you just made.

00:18:32.279 --> 00:18:33.039
Show it to me.

00:18:43.559 --> 00:18:45.680
Why did it shut down?

00:18:46.559 --> 00:18:47.519
My hand...

00:18:55.039 --> 00:18:56.319
Then you take a quick nap first.

00:18:56.519 --> 00:18:57.599
I'll call you in a bit.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.279
Darn it.

00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:38.400
Second Brother.

00:19:45.119 --> 00:19:46.720
Second Brother.

00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.839
Second Brother.

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.519
Again?

00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:51.559
This rat race is too much.

00:21:54.279 --> 00:21:55.079
Honey.

00:22:02.680 --> 00:22:04.160
How come you're back, sweetie?

00:22:05.599 --> 00:22:06.759
Why didn't you tell me?

00:22:06.759 --> 00:22:07.799
I would have picked you up.

00:22:10.359 --> 00:22:11.119
It's fine.

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.079
Seeing you has perked me right up.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.559
I stayed up all night making spreadsheets.

00:22:20.559 --> 00:22:22.160
Didn't sleep a wink.

00:22:27.480 --> 00:22:29.599
Honey, honey.

00:22:31.839 --> 00:22:33.319
I have a surprise for you.

00:22:35.559 --> 00:22:37.599
Are you sure it's a surprise, not a shock?

00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.000
It really is a surprise.

00:22:43.680 --> 00:22:44.680
Got an upset stomach?

00:22:59.079 --> 00:22:59.720
Really.

00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:08.000
Really.

00:23:10.559 --> 00:23:11.279
Really.

00:23:12.559 --> 00:23:13.720
I'm going to be a dad.

00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.440
I'm going to be a dad.

00:23:24.559 --> 00:23:25.599
Oh my god.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.440
I'm going to be a dad, right?

00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:37.160
Oh my god.

00:23:37.480 --> 00:23:38.920
I'm going to be a dad, right?

00:23:41.279 --> 00:23:42.640
Are you okay? Are you okay?

00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:10.839
Honey

00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:15.279
I think

00:24:17.839 --> 00:24:20.720
I feel... really strange.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.880
Originally, it was because of us

00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:26.400
that I wanted a child.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.319
But now, all I can think about

00:24:30.559 --> 00:24:32.880
is that as long as the baby can

00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:34.599
arrive safely in this world,

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.920
I'm willing to endure any hardship.

00:24:44.759 --> 00:24:45.519
Darling

00:24:47.640 --> 00:24:50.759
There's something I need to make clear.

00:24:51.519 --> 00:24:52.839
What is it?

00:24:55.319 --> 00:24:57.359
When the baby's born, don't neglect me, okay?

00:25:00.119 --> 00:25:01.880
Are you crazy?

00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:34.799
Think about it, once your wife gets pregnant,

00:25:34.799 --> 00:25:37.000
the financial pressure will be huge, right?

00:25:37.519 --> 00:25:40.640
Those two medicines are ridiculously expensive.

00:25:40.759 --> 00:25:43.680
I told the doctor to stop them.

00:25:44.759 --> 00:25:46.359
Can you stop relying so much on Uncle Ma?

00:25:46.359 --> 00:25:47.480
You're a grown adult.

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:48.400
You're an adult.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.359
You need to learn to solve your own problems.

00:25:52.799 --> 00:25:55.279
You can't compete with the young guys at work,

00:25:55.599 --> 00:25:56.880
who pays the mortgage?

00:25:57.319 --> 00:25:58.519
Your wife does.

00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.200
A grown man,

00:26:00.319 --> 00:26:01.759
not focusing on building a career,

00:26:01.920 --> 00:26:03.880
just whining every day about going to Xi'an to find your wife.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.319
Have you no shame?

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.920
Well, you need to think carefully

00:26:08.079 --> 00:26:09.640
about your role and position.

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:12.799
Only then can you prove your worth.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.960
This promotion opportunity

00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:16.559
will be given to Xiao Jia.

00:26:16.559 --> 00:26:17.920
You don't worry about anything,

00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:19.240
you just play the nice guy.

00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:20.839
So when problems arise, I have to solve them.

00:26:20.839 --> 00:26:22.920
You can even mix up a bag worth tens of thousands.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:24.839
At least make up a believable lie.

00:26:25.519 --> 00:26:27.279
Ever since Peng Le Xuan opened,

00:26:27.319 --> 00:26:28.759
you haven't accomplished a single thing.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:30.880
Told to bring in clients, you failed.

00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:33.440
Li Lianbao told you to quit your bank job

00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.440
and focus on the startup.

00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:36.480
You didn't listen, made endless excuses.

00:26:36.839 --> 00:26:38.920
You keep telling me you'll work hard,

00:26:39.039 --> 00:26:40.279
but are you really trying?

00:26:40.519 --> 00:26:41.960
You're just *acting* like you're trying.

00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:43.960
Daily, monthly, quarterly, annual reports...

00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.079
Look at the garbage you wrote yourself.

00:27:33.279 --> 00:27:34.519
Brother Tong, congratulations!

00:27:37.039 --> 00:27:38.759
Old Tong, congrats!

00:27:40.359 --> 00:27:41.839
Congrats, Brother Tong!

00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.640
Brother Tong, congratulations!

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:50.839
How did you know?

00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.680
Doesn't everyone know already?

00:27:52.799 --> 00:27:54.759
How does everyone know about that...

00:27:55.039 --> 00:27:57.119
Your Peng Le Xuan is really impressive.

00:27:57.119 --> 00:27:59.359
Another huge investment came in this morning.

00:27:59.359 --> 00:28:00.920
Several million, right?

00:28:01.279 --> 00:28:02.160
About that...

00:28:02.759 --> 00:28:03.720
Congratulations!

00:28:04.119 --> 00:28:04.640
Thanks.

00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:22.000
Let's all get together after work tonight.

00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.480
I have something to announce.

00:28:28.880 --> 00:28:30.640
Come on, everyone.

00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:32.119
Bottoms up!

00:28:37.240 --> 00:28:38.200
Are you raising fish in there?

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:39.440
Yeah.

00:28:40.559 --> 00:28:41.279
No, what's up?

00:28:41.279 --> 00:28:43.079
If you don't like it, I can get you a bottle of red.

00:28:43.119 --> 00:28:44.079
No, no, it's fine.

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.720
Today is a double celebration!

00:28:47.079 --> 00:28:48.559
Big Brother won the Roast Duck King title.

00:28:48.599 --> 00:28:50.079
And Qiu'er became a father.

00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:51.880
Wait, no.

00:28:51.880 --> 00:28:53.799
It's actually a quadruple celebration.

00:28:53.920 --> 00:28:54.880
Listen up, guys.

00:28:55.079 --> 00:28:57.119
Kevin's second payment has already come in.

00:28:57.119 --> 00:28:57.880
Really?

00:28:58.799 --> 00:29:01.279
Next, I'll close the deal with Boss Dong.

00:29:01.279 --> 00:29:02.359
That'll bring in another chunk of cash.

00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:04.720
Qiu'er, we'll deposit it with you again.

00:29:05.599 --> 00:29:06.759
I won't say thanks for the huge favor.

00:29:06.759 --> 00:29:08.599
I'll down this one first, Second Brother.

00:29:08.599 --> 00:29:09.960
Don't be so polite with me.

00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.960
This is all money the four of us earned together.

00:29:13.359 --> 00:29:14.400
Actually...

00:29:16.079 --> 00:29:17.480
I didn't contribute much.

00:29:17.759 --> 00:29:19.640
Qiu'er, don't say that.

00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:21.839
You were chubby since you were a kid.

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.640
So fat you were like a little ball.

00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:25.599
The three of us teased you nonstop.

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:26.680
Who would've thought...

00:29:26.680 --> 00:29:27.640
All that teasing...

00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.400
Teased you into a tall, slender guy.

00:29:30.559 --> 00:29:32.720
A little more teasing and he's a dad now.

00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:35.160
The fat you had as a kid wasn't real meat.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.160
That was just puppy fat.

00:29:37.359 --> 00:29:38.680
It's not over till it's over, right?

00:29:39.079 --> 00:29:40.400
Right, it's not over till it's over.

00:29:41.079 --> 00:29:42.559
Qiu'er, you're a father now.

00:29:42.559 --> 00:29:44.200
Gotta work harder for that baby formula money.

00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.920
Yeah, how's that client of yours going?

00:29:47.359 --> 00:29:48.359
If you have any problems,

00:29:48.359 --> 00:29:49.160
you can tell us.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.319
We can give you advice, right?

00:29:50.319 --> 00:29:51.119
Forget it, forget it.

00:29:51.119 --> 00:29:53.359
Today is just a victory party, right?

00:29:53.359 --> 00:29:54.359
Let's not talk about work.

00:29:54.359 --> 00:29:55.519
Come on, come on.

00:29:55.519 --> 00:29:55.880
Here, here.

00:29:55.880 --> 00:29:58.799
Right, Qiu'er is new to this business.

00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:01.200
He needs some time to grow.

00:30:03.039 --> 00:30:04.039
Actually, you know what?

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.440
I really do want to talk about this today.

00:30:07.799 --> 00:30:08.680
Talk about what?

00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:09.720
It's just that...

00:30:12.279 --> 00:30:13.960
I want to quit Peng Le Xuan.

00:30:18.119 --> 00:30:20.359
And give my shares back to you guys.

00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:25.880
Big Brother, just listen to him.

00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.160
We're about to make big money.

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.400
He'd quit right now?

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.640
He's joking.

00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.920
No, I'm not joking.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:33.359
I've thought it through clearly.

00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:35.359
What have you thought through clearly?

00:30:35.359 --> 00:30:37.960
Peng Le Xuan is run by the four of us.

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:39.440
I'm putting my foot down today.

00:30:43.039 --> 00:30:44.759
Big Brother, can you not get angry first?

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.680
Can you let me finish first?

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:47.920
No, what are you saying?

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:49.680
Qiu'er.

00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.759
Why did I move out of Courtyard 36?

00:30:54.079 --> 00:30:56.480
Why did I struggle to learn roast duck again?

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.440
Why?

00:30:57.839 --> 00:30:59.319
So the brothers could build up Peng Le Xuan

00:30:59.319 --> 00:31:00.440
together again.

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.200
Why?

00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:03.640
Wasn't it just so the four of us could be together?

00:31:03.759 --> 00:31:05.839
And now you're telling me you quit?

00:31:06.119 --> 00:31:07.200
What are you thinking?

00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:08.640
I'm telling you, no way!

00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:13.160
Big Brother, listen to him first.

00:31:17.079 --> 00:31:18.160
Then I'll speak.

00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.880
Actually, I've figured it out these past few days.

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.839
I think a person has to accept their fate.

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.680
You have to know your own limits.

00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:31.640
I don't have much talent.

00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:33.400
And I don't have big ambitions.

00:31:33.599 --> 00:31:35.160
I just want a simple,

00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:36.880
easy-going life.

00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:37.720
Look,

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.920
Big Brother, I'm not as tough on myself as you are.

00:31:40.319 --> 00:31:42.640
You can practice your craft even while vomiting.

00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:44.640
And I'm not in the rat race like Second Brother.

00:31:45.079 --> 00:31:47.079
Treating overtime like a daily meal.

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:49.200
And always staying full of energy.

00:31:49.519 --> 00:31:50.240
Third Brother.

00:31:50.880 --> 00:31:51.880
Third Brother.

00:31:52.839 --> 00:31:53.599
Third Brother.

00:31:56.119 --> 00:31:57.880
We're not from the same world.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.880
Someone like me,

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:01.880
what help can I be to Peng Le Xuan?

00:32:02.519 --> 00:32:04.440
I can only hold you guys back.

00:32:05.799 --> 00:32:07.640
That makes me feel bad too, you know?

00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:09.599
That's the first reason.

00:32:10.119 --> 00:32:10.880
The second reason is...

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:12.839
I think a person can't have a foot in two boats.

00:32:12.839 --> 00:32:13.880
You'll capsize both.

00:32:14.119 --> 00:32:16.119
Biting off more than one can chew.

00:32:17.359 --> 00:32:18.599
Trying to please both sides,

00:32:18.599 --> 00:32:19.599
trying to have it both ways...

00:32:19.599 --> 00:32:20.440
It's impossible.

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.759
Nothing's that easy.

00:32:23.319 --> 00:32:24.440
So I was thinking...

00:32:25.759 --> 00:32:27.720
Maybe I should just focus on one thing.

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.640
Something within my capabilities.

00:32:31.799 --> 00:32:33.000
So I think...

00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:38.759
the bank job is still right for me.

00:32:40.799 --> 00:32:42.799
Didn't you say the bank was tough?

00:32:42.799 --> 00:32:44.079
Tough, yes it's tough.

00:32:44.079 --> 00:32:45.640
But what job isn't tough?

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:49.599
At least I've done it for over ten years.

00:32:49.599 --> 00:32:52.799
I can still handle those tasks with my current skills.

00:32:55.839 --> 00:32:58.599
So you plan to just coast along at the bank?

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.000
It's not coasting.

00:33:05.319 --> 00:33:07.799
Before, I thought I was working hard.

00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.440
But this time,

00:33:10.160 --> 00:33:11.640
I finally saw what real effort looks like.

00:33:11.640 --> 00:33:12.640
Look at Big Brother.

00:33:13.720 --> 00:33:14.799
He won the Roast Duck King.

00:33:14.880 --> 00:33:15.640
Second Brother.

00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.480
Brought in the money.

00:33:18.119 --> 00:33:19.680
Got Peng Le Xuan back on its feet.

00:33:20.039 --> 00:33:21.400
Qiu'er, what's wrong?

00:33:21.599 --> 00:33:22.400
Second Brother.

00:33:23.759 --> 00:33:25.680
How's the investment deal really going?

00:33:27.039 --> 00:33:29.359
I'm talking to a few interested clients.

00:33:29.839 --> 00:33:31.400
I'm not rushing you, Second Brother.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:32.640
But it really needs to be soon.

00:33:33.119 --> 00:33:35.079
This place is no place for people.

00:33:35.440 --> 00:33:37.119
After you secure the investment,

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:42.400
we need to tell Big Brother right away.

00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:43.920
I'll hurry.

00:33:44.079 --> 00:33:44.799
Just wait a bit more.

00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.440
I was just thinking, maybe...

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.400
I should also put in some real effort.

00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:53.920
To see if I can

00:33:57.279 --> 00:33:58.920
make something of myself at the bank.

00:34:00.759 --> 00:34:03.079
Right, Big Brother?

00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:12.639
Alright.

00:34:14.599 --> 00:34:16.239
If you really think that way,

00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:19.760
then just focus on doing well at the bank.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:22.760
As for the restaurant,

00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:24.559
don't worry about it for now.

00:34:25.119 --> 00:34:26.519
But your shares,

00:34:26.719 --> 00:34:27.559
we'll keep them for you.

00:34:30.519 --> 00:34:31.519
Actually, no.

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:34.599
Having this with me

00:34:34.599 --> 00:34:35.679
makes me feel uneasy.

00:34:35.679 --> 00:34:37.039
No, you're being silly.

00:34:37.039 --> 00:34:37.760
No, no.

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.039
I... I need to cut off my retreat first.

00:34:40.039 --> 00:34:42.239
I think only someone like me can

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:45.480
charge forward without hesitation.

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:50.239
No, then why bother?

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:52.920
Big Brother.

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:54.840
Qiu'er.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.360
How about this.

00:34:56.760 --> 00:34:57.960
Your portion,

00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:59.320
Big Brother, Lianbao, and I

00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:00.320
will discuss it

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.320
and then decide how to handle it.

00:35:01.320 --> 00:35:02.599
I'll give you a sum of money first.

00:35:02.760 --> 00:35:03.559
Use it for now.

00:35:07.719 --> 00:35:09.639
Actually, getting to this point

00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:11.800
is already quite an achievement, I think.

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:14.119
Although it's not quite what we imagined,

00:35:14.840 --> 00:35:16.119
but I think you're right.

00:35:16.599 --> 00:35:18.400
Everyone should know their own limits.

00:35:18.599 --> 00:35:20.400
And everyone has their own place.

00:35:22.159 --> 00:35:23.119
Let's leave it at that for now.

00:35:25.039 --> 00:35:25.880
Alright then.

00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:28.840
Qiu'er, take this money first, okay?

00:35:29.360 --> 00:35:31.519
It'll give you some breathing room.

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.519
I also really think Qiu'er,

00:35:34.519 --> 00:35:35.840
having the kid run back and forth like this,

00:35:35.840 --> 00:35:36.840
don't let him get worn out.

00:35:37.679 --> 00:35:38.880
So let's do that for now.

00:35:42.639 --> 00:35:44.880
Whenever you want to come back, just say the word.

00:35:56.119 --> 00:35:56.920
Five hundred thousand.

00:35:57.559 --> 00:35:58.480
Take it for now.

00:36:01.159 --> 00:36:01.719
A deposit.

00:36:02.159 --> 00:36:02.840
A deposit.

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:03.840
Deposit, deposit.

00:36:04.119 --> 00:36:04.760
A deposit.

00:36:09.440 --> 00:36:10.280
Honey.

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:12.199
Have you ever thought,

00:36:12.719 --> 00:36:14.440
if Peng Le Xuan does well,

00:36:14.519 --> 00:36:16.480
your annual dividend could be more than five hundred thousand?

00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:19.280
Yes, yes.

00:36:19.719 --> 00:36:21.239
But didn't you say it yourself?

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.800
I can't just rely on brotherly bonds

00:36:22.800 --> 00:36:23.639
to stay at Peng Le Xuan, right?

00:36:23.639 --> 00:36:26.199
I need to find my own value and purpose.

00:36:27.559 --> 00:36:29.039
I looked. I didn't find it.

00:36:29.239 --> 00:36:30.920
So that money isn't meant for me to earn.

00:36:33.679 --> 00:36:34.360
Fine.

00:36:35.039 --> 00:36:36.440
Since you've made up your mind,

00:36:36.519 --> 00:36:37.960
there's no point in me stopping you.

00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.840
Then just work hard at the bank from now on.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:43.000
Okay.

00:36:43.199 --> 00:36:44.719
Just watch me, kid.

00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:42.199
I'll be more diligent than going to work.

00:37:43.239 --> 00:37:44.920
I have an academic question

00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:45.840
I'd like to ask you.

00:37:46.199 --> 00:37:46.920
Go ahead.

00:37:47.559 --> 00:37:50.440
I heard autumn in Beijing is especially beautiful.

00:37:50.519 --> 00:37:53.320
The streets are lined with golden ginkgo trees.

00:37:53.599 --> 00:37:54.480
You've seen it, right?

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:55.559
Yes.

00:37:56.280 --> 00:37:58.079
Under the autumn ginkgo trees,

00:37:58.079 --> 00:37:59.599
people often line up to take photos.

00:37:59.599 --> 00:38:01.559
Especially little girls and aunties.

00:38:04.599 --> 00:38:06.639
It's a shame autumn is still far away.

00:38:07.039 --> 00:38:08.159
I can't wait.

00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.800
I want to see it with my own eyes soon.

00:38:10.239 --> 00:38:11.480
Is that all you wanted to ask?

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:13.360
I only recently learned

00:38:13.400 --> 00:38:16.199
that all the ginkgo trees in the world come from China.

00:38:16.239 --> 00:38:17.960
You're so knowledgeable,

00:38:18.119 --> 00:38:19.400
you must know the reason, right?

00:38:19.599 --> 00:38:22.159
I haven't really studied that.

00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.920
Let me give you a simple science lesson.

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.079
The ginkgo tree

00:38:25.199 --> 00:38:27.760
existed over three hundred million years ago in the Carboniferous Period.

00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:29.360
It's even older than the dinosaurs.

00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:31.119
It was once widespread all over the world.

00:38:31.639 --> 00:38:33.480
After the glacial movements,

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.519
all the ginkgo families in the world

00:38:35.519 --> 00:38:37.000
went completely extinct.

00:38:37.119 --> 00:38:39.320
Only the ginkgo trees in China survived.

00:38:39.599 --> 00:38:40.800
Do you know why?

00:38:41.280 --> 00:38:42.840
Because it lived so long

00:38:43.039 --> 00:38:44.559
it outlived all its natural enemies.

00:38:45.039 --> 00:38:46.639
Don't you have any thoughts after hearing that?

00:38:47.079 --> 00:38:48.360
That's pretty impressive.

00:38:49.760 --> 00:38:51.559
Even the dinosaurs went extinct,

00:38:51.559 --> 00:38:53.320
but the Chinese ginkgo could still pull through.

00:38:53.519 --> 00:38:54.800
As a Chinese person,

00:38:54.800 --> 00:38:56.079
shouldn't you learn from

00:38:56.079 --> 00:38:58.880
the ginkgo's tenacious will to survive?

00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.679
Medical science is constantly advancing.

00:39:00.679 --> 00:39:01.679
Maybe one day

00:39:01.679 --> 00:39:03.199
we can outlast the virus too.

00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:18.960
I've told the story.

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:22.119
Are there any other methods?

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:37.159
You're not even related to him, yet you help him so much.

00:39:37.159 --> 00:39:38.639
You must like him.

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:40.800
Why not just confess your feelings to him?

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:43.239
It might stimulate his will to live.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:46.320
With this kind of illness, the patient themselves must want to live.

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:36.519
Out riding your bike in person?

00:40:36.599 --> 00:40:37.519
What are you doing here?

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.000
I'm here to supervise you.

00:40:39.199 --> 00:40:40.920
Getting some sun, riding a bike, it's good.

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:42.159
Helps with recovery.

00:40:42.159 --> 00:40:43.440
Don't follow me. I want to ride alone.

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.599
I'm not following you.

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:45.679
How is this following you?

00:40:45.679 --> 00:40:46.519
Stay away from me.

00:40:46.519 --> 00:40:47.360
Watch out!

00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:49.719
What are you doing?

00:40:49.719 --> 00:40:50.559
Are you crazy?

00:40:51.719 --> 00:40:52.519
Yeah, I am sick.

00:40:52.519 --> 00:40:53.639
If I weren't sick, why would I follow you?

00:40:53.639 --> 00:40:54.719
*I'm* the one who's sick.

00:40:57.360 --> 00:40:59.119
Why so serious?

00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:00.519
Be happy.

00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:02.159
Riding a bike is great.

00:41:02.159 --> 00:41:02.960
I'm ignoring you.

00:41:04.599 --> 00:41:06.239
So cold.

00:41:33.559 --> 00:41:34.280
You're a girl.

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:35.360
Can't you be a little more reserved?

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:36.920
I want to help you.

00:41:37.039 --> 00:41:38.440
If you want to help me, stay away from me.

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:39.480
Stop following me all the time.
