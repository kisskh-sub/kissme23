WEBVTT

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:04.260
Hey.

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:05.436
You're just too beautiful, aren't you?

00:01:05.436 --> 00:01:07.730
You're marrying Yuri and
yet you also have Keifer.

00:01:09.023 --> 00:01:10.691
Damn it!

00:01:10.691 --> 00:01:11.484
What's wrong?

00:01:11.818 --> 00:01:13.361
I've been thinking of
telling Yuri about us.

00:01:13.736 --> 00:01:15.029
It's really Keifer.

00:01:15.238 --> 00:01:16.906
I knew from the start
it was Keifer.

00:01:17.073 --> 00:01:19.742
But on our wedding day,
you will say "I do."

00:01:19.742 --> 00:01:20.840
Because if you don't,

00:01:20.865 --> 00:01:22.245
I'll destroy Fer Corp.

00:01:22.578 --> 00:01:23.496
Hey, three dumbos!

00:01:23.496 --> 00:01:25.790
I just hope you won't regret
choosing him over Yuri.

00:01:26.233 --> 00:01:27.918
Section E is divided once again.

00:01:28.042 --> 00:01:29.919
Jay, get dressed.
We're going somewhere.

00:01:30.586 --> 00:01:34.132
Why don't we talk about
the upcoming wedding?

00:01:35.007 --> 00:01:35.716
Oh my gosh.

00:01:35.716 --> 00:01:38.636
Can you at least try not to show them
that you don't want to marry me.

00:01:38.761 --> 00:01:41.556
I don't deserve this.
I don't deserve your love.

00:01:41.889 --> 00:01:42.849
You're not…

00:01:43.141 --> 00:01:44.308
even pretty.

00:01:44.308 --> 00:01:45.852
But the way you
flirt with everyone,

00:01:45.852 --> 00:01:47.395
it's as if you'll
run out of boys.

00:01:47.395 --> 00:01:49.063
You got that from your mom,
didn't you?

00:01:49.063 --> 00:01:49.981
You're just like your-

00:01:50.663 --> 00:01:51.998
What the fuck?!

00:01:52.403 --> 00:01:54.447
How long do you plan to fool, Jay huh?

00:01:54.447 --> 00:01:56.908
Wow, bonding with Jay
like you don't know anything!

00:01:56.908 --> 00:01:59.327
[Section E fighting]

00:01:59.327 --> 00:02:01.579
What's happening,
why are you all fighting?!

00:02:03.889 --> 00:02:04.973
What's going on?

00:02:05.891 --> 00:02:07.267
Why did they end up fighting?

00:02:07.893 --> 00:02:09.436
When I left them,
everything was alright.

00:02:09.436 --> 00:02:10.729
But when I came back,
it was a mess.

00:02:11.605 --> 00:02:15.359
Getting into fights is
nothing new for these boys.

00:02:15.818 --> 00:02:17.319
But why does this feel different?

00:02:18.112 --> 00:02:19.196
It feels heavy,

00:02:19.404 --> 00:02:21.031
and I can't quite figure out why.

00:02:22.282 --> 00:02:24.118
Should I talk to them?

00:02:24.952 --> 00:02:27.579
I should, I need to know.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.873
They shouldn't be hiding
anything from me.

00:02:32.501 --> 00:02:35.170
I know something's wrong
even if they don't say it.

00:02:35.963 --> 00:02:38.465
I hate it when something
is being kept from me.

00:02:39.508 --> 00:02:41.552
I need to know what
they're hiding from me.

00:02:44.096 --> 00:02:45.096
Huh?

00:02:47.474 --> 00:02:48.642
Why are there so many chocolates?

00:02:54.523 --> 00:02:55.523
Oh, okay.

00:02:56.316 --> 00:02:58.360
Auntie Gemma put these here.

00:02:58.615 --> 00:03:01.493
I saw her earlier carrying
a bag of chocolates.

00:03:09.084 --> 00:03:10.084
Ci-N!

00:03:12.045 --> 00:03:13.045
Is that for me?

00:03:14.005 --> 00:03:15.005
Yes,

00:03:15.381 --> 00:03:18.009
if you answer my question.

00:03:18.843 --> 00:03:20.095
I already know what
you're going to ask, Jay.

00:03:20.095 --> 00:03:21.471
I'm not answering you.
Do whatever you want.

00:03:31.439 --> 00:03:33.775
Hey!

00:03:39.954 --> 00:03:40.954
Jay!!!

00:03:46.268 --> 00:03:47.268
Wow, it's so…

00:03:48.204 --> 00:03:49.607
- sweet!
- It's sweet?

00:03:49.632 --> 00:03:50.648
Mmm!

00:03:50.648 --> 00:03:53.584
- Jay, just one please.
- It’s easy on the palate.

00:03:53.609 --> 00:03:57.196
They say it's good to eat
sweets while reviewing.

00:03:57.738 --> 00:04:01.033
If you eat chocolates
before an exam,

00:04:02.201 --> 00:04:03.285
it makes you smarter.

00:04:03.494 --> 00:04:04.662
Really?

00:04:04.745 --> 00:04:06.622
You’ll pass with flying colors.

00:04:08.832 --> 00:04:09.832
Mmm!

00:04:10.334 --> 00:04:12.378
Best chocolate ever!

00:04:21.053 --> 00:04:22.179
Sure, you can have the wrapper.

00:04:22.388 --> 00:04:23.388
Jay!!!

00:04:25.974 --> 00:04:27.892
Stop it, it's not funny.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:31.680
He's getting annoyed.

00:04:34.624 --> 00:04:37.001
- Jay, please.
- That's my favorite.

00:04:37.001 --> 00:04:39.212
It’s easy on the palate!

00:04:40.922 --> 00:04:42.173
Okay fine, I'll talk!

00:04:42.173 --> 00:04:43.382
Just give me one, please!

00:04:43.382 --> 00:04:45.426
Just one, Jay.

00:04:45.426 --> 00:04:47.720
Please, Jay.

00:04:48.212 --> 00:04:49.212
See this?

00:04:51.299 --> 00:04:54.302
And this?

00:04:56.429 --> 00:05:02.810
Just answer my question
and you'll get all of these.

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:05.605
Don't fall for it, Ci!
We can buy that later.

00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:07.148
Everything!

00:05:07.398 --> 00:05:08.398
Damn it!

00:05:09.942 --> 00:05:10.985
Tell me, Ci.

00:05:12.904 --> 00:05:14.614
Why were you guys fighting?

00:05:17.033 --> 00:05:18.033
Tell me, Ci.

00:05:22.442 --> 00:05:23.442
Mmm.

00:05:23.467 --> 00:05:27.030
I can still taste
the sweetness of the chocolate!

00:05:30.682 --> 00:05:32.892
It's because Keifer
and Yuri were arguing.

00:05:34.157 --> 00:05:38.703
We chose sides,
so it turned into a bigger fight.

00:05:42.737 --> 00:05:43.738
It's happening.

00:05:44.405 --> 00:05:45.281
This is it.

00:05:45.281 --> 00:05:46.281
You said that's mine!

00:05:47.867 --> 00:05:49.285
Section E is getting divided.

00:05:49.785 --> 00:05:51.120
This isn't right.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.120
Give it!

00:05:54.936 --> 00:05:55.937
What was the fight about?

00:05:56.104 --> 00:05:57.314
Shut up, Ci-N!

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.481
You shut it!

00:06:00.275 --> 00:06:02.193
For fuck's sake, just speak up!

00:06:02.193 --> 00:06:03.945
Shut up, stop interfering!

00:06:03.945 --> 00:06:05.780
You're just making
things harder for Ci-N!

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:06.948
Just mind your own business!

00:06:11.804 --> 00:06:12.804
Here, you can have it.

00:06:12.829 --> 00:06:15.332
Thank you so much, Jay!

00:06:15.332 --> 00:06:16.332
Thank you, Jay!

00:06:19.627 --> 00:06:22.005
I'll kick your ass if you get one!

00:06:22.756 --> 00:06:24.090
I really don't know
with these people.

00:06:24.341 --> 00:06:26.092
After everything, they're choosing
to fight each other now?

00:06:26.926 --> 00:06:28.219
The retreat is coming up.

00:06:29.512 --> 00:06:31.014
Bring out your papers, guys.

00:06:32.265 --> 00:06:33.600
The exam will start in a minute.

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:35.352
Ah, whatever.
Do what you guys want!

00:06:35.977 --> 00:06:38.730
The retreat will be fun, so I'm
sure they'll be okay soon enough.

00:06:39.022 --> 00:06:41.274
I'm sure they'll make up again

00:06:41.274 --> 00:06:42.525
once we start enjoying
at the retreat.

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:45.733
Ah, Sir! I'm feeling smart today,

00:06:45.733 --> 00:06:47.318
- I ate chocolate.
- Are you sure about that, Ms. Mariano?

00:06:47.926 --> 00:06:48.926
Sir.

00:06:49.272 --> 00:06:50.732
But before we have fun,

00:06:51.343 --> 00:06:53.679
time to face this exam first.

00:06:53.762 --> 00:06:54.762
Good luck, class.

00:08:34.212 --> 00:08:35.212
Time's up!

00:08:35.672 --> 00:08:36.715
Basic.

00:08:39.259 --> 00:08:40.259
Until what page were you on?

00:08:40.635 --> 00:08:41.635
Shit!

00:08:42.692 --> 00:08:43.692
Stupid!

00:08:45.194 --> 00:08:48.155
Huh? You were able to answer?

00:08:50.932 --> 00:08:51.932
Thank you.

00:08:52.684 --> 00:08:54.561
Sir! Are we dismissed?

00:08:54.561 --> 00:08:55.561
Yes.

00:08:55.848 --> 00:08:57.275
- Really?
- Pass your papers, now.

00:08:58.434 --> 00:08:59.434
Are you going home?

00:09:00.588 --> 00:09:01.625
Where are you going after this?

00:09:02.448 --> 00:09:03.543
Bye, Sir!

00:09:04.544 --> 00:09:05.920
- Let's hang out.
- Okay, where?

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:06.920
Anywhere.

00:09:09.007 --> 00:09:10.342
Ms. Mariano,

00:09:10.604 --> 00:09:13.649
Don't forget to have your paperwork
signed by your previous school.

00:09:13.789 --> 00:09:14.873
I need them by Monday.

00:09:15.582 --> 00:09:16.917
Wait, Sir! I'm not finished yet.

00:09:17.125 --> 00:09:18.293
- Time's up.
- Huh?

00:09:23.365 --> 00:09:24.365
So annoying!

00:09:24.390 --> 00:09:25.390
I almost forgot about that.

00:09:25.968 --> 00:09:27.678
One more thing to worry about.

00:09:43.134 --> 00:09:44.134
This sucks!

00:09:44.677 --> 00:09:46.304
Those idiots still
won't answer me,

00:09:46.304 --> 00:09:48.267
and I come home
to find Ella in here!

00:09:53.745 --> 00:09:55.205
If you still won't answer me,

00:09:56.748 --> 00:09:58.500
don't bother talking
to me ever again.

00:10:04.455 --> 00:10:05.623
Hey, brat!

00:10:06.415 --> 00:10:08.208
Jay, I don't want to talk about it.

00:10:08.792 --> 00:10:10.461
It shouldn't come from me.

00:10:12.020 --> 00:10:13.020
What do you mean?

00:10:13.213 --> 00:10:14.381
What is it really about?

00:10:14.882 --> 00:10:16.074
Ah, nevermind.

00:10:16.088 --> 00:10:18.257
But I hope you can forgive me.

00:10:18.257 --> 00:10:20.036
We made a huge mistake.

00:10:20.735 --> 00:10:21.819
Huge.

00:10:21.819 --> 00:10:23.446
Forgive you?
What are you talking about?

00:10:24.864 --> 00:10:26.115
Ci-N! Hello?!

00:10:28.951 --> 00:10:29.994
So annoying.

00:10:39.253 --> 00:10:40.922
Wait, no.

00:10:41.724 --> 00:10:43.309
Why would I talk to her?

00:10:44.935 --> 00:10:45.935
No,

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:48.355
I have to do this.

00:11:19.759 --> 00:11:20.759
Nice room.

00:11:22.973 --> 00:11:24.309
What are you doing here?

00:11:31.550 --> 00:11:33.052
So you and Keifer are
together now, huh?

00:11:36.028 --> 00:11:37.030
What about Yuri?

00:11:39.573 --> 00:11:40.573
What about him?

00:11:41.158 --> 00:11:42.618
You don't even like him,

00:11:43.952 --> 00:11:45.913
so why are you still marrying him?

00:11:47.164 --> 00:11:48.707
Tell that to him, not to me.

00:11:53.504 --> 00:11:54.880
I know Yuri.

00:11:56.173 --> 00:11:57.675
He's still hoping.

00:12:04.890 --> 00:12:06.308
And he wouldn't hold on,

00:12:06.809 --> 00:12:08.435
if he wasn't being led on.

00:12:09.556 --> 00:12:10.556
What are you trying to say?

00:12:11.391 --> 00:12:12.518
Leave Yuri alone.

00:12:13.727 --> 00:12:14.978
You're just hurting him.

00:12:18.315 --> 00:12:21.610
Wow! Look who's talking!

00:12:21.860 --> 00:12:23.111
Who hurt him first, huh?

00:12:23.111 --> 00:12:24.196
Really, coming from you?

00:12:24.279 --> 00:12:26.949
You don't know exactly
what you're talking about!

00:12:26.949 --> 00:12:27.825
You know what, just leave!

00:12:28.283 --> 00:12:30.327
Don't talk to me like that.

00:12:31.687 --> 00:12:32.996
You don't know anything
about me either.

00:12:33.705 --> 00:12:36.041
So you also don't have the
right to talk to me like that.

00:12:36.730 --> 00:12:37.730
Leave.

00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:41.590
Wow.

00:12:42.506 --> 00:12:44.341
You'll regret being with Keifer.

I need to talk you alone.

Camp is rock.

Which one is mine here again, David?

00:13:41.177 --> 00:13:42.845
It's been so long since I went here.

00:13:42.845 --> 00:13:43.888
You know what, it’s so unfair.

00:13:43.888 --> 00:13:46.599
Why was our service late?
And it looks like it’s just us here.

00:13:48.131 --> 00:13:48.882
This is taking so long.

00:13:50.214 --> 00:13:52.466
- Where are the organizers?
- Did we arrive earlier than them?

Fuck!

00:13:53.586 --> 00:13:55.338
I woke up so early for this!

00:13:55.338 --> 00:13:56.881
I don't deserve this one bit!

We're the only ones here?

00:14:00.922 --> 00:14:05.009
I didn't even plan on coming
back here near Holy Saints.

Why are you covering your mouth?

I'm laughing at Freya.
Look at her, so stupid.

She’ll have a hard time walking.

say sorry for everything
I've done to you before.

Forget about it.

00:23:30.258 --> 00:23:31.718
"Help" my ass...

00:23:32.135 --> 00:23:33.220
Get her up!

00:23:34.471 --> 00:23:35.222
Pull her up.

00:23:38.767 --> 00:23:39.434
That's not enough.

00:23:39.832 --> 00:23:41.125
This one will end it!

00:23:46.179 --> 00:23:47.388
Jay!!!

00:23:54.652 --> 00:23:55.152
Jay!

00:24:03.137 --> 00:24:04.388
Jay! I got you.

00:24:05.403 --> 00:24:05.946
Are you okay?

00:24:11.005 --> 00:24:11.756
Jay, are you alright?

00:24:12.331 --> 00:24:13.457
Where did you get hit?

00:24:14.583 --> 00:24:15.876
What do you want from me, huh?

00:24:15.876 --> 00:24:16.960
So we finally meet!

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.253
What the fuck are you doing?

00:24:18.921 --> 00:24:21.632
- And who the fucking hell are you?
- Yuri Hanamitchi.

00:24:22.508 --> 00:24:23.675
Mark Keifer Watson.

00:24:23.675 --> 00:24:25.135
Nice to fucking meet you!

00:24:40.901 --> 00:24:42.069
So you want to fight, huh?

00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.686
The tall one's handsome.

00:24:49.686 --> 00:24:51.521
The red-haired one
is even hotter.

00:24:54.244 --> 00:24:55.704
He's hotter.

00:24:56.158 --> 00:24:56.825
Who?

00:24:57.464 --> 00:24:58.132
Him.

00:25:05.472 --> 00:25:06.307
My stuff…

00:25:07.028 --> 00:25:08.488
We'll look for it later.

00:25:09.308 --> 00:25:10.935
Let's finish this first.

00:25:13.145 --> 00:25:14.647
Go finish them off!

00:25:18.567 --> 00:25:19.902
Get up!

00:25:20.402 --> 00:25:21.445
What now, asshole?

00:25:21.445 --> 00:25:22.655
I don't know, we might
get dragged into this.

00:25:32.787 --> 00:25:33.746
You can’t move already, can you?

00:25:33.746 --> 00:25:34.705
You deserve that punch.

00:25:34.705 --> 00:25:35.539
Kick him, bro.

00:25:36.091 --> 00:25:37.676
You really won’t stop, huh?

00:25:37.676 --> 00:25:39.094
You still got the guts to fight back.

00:25:39.928 --> 00:25:41.888
So brave, huh?

00:25:43.348 --> 00:25:43.932
What?

00:25:46.184 --> 00:25:47.018
How was that, bro?

00:25:48.311 --> 00:25:49.437
Nice one!

00:25:50.063 --> 00:25:50.772
Solid!

00:25:55.151 --> 00:25:56.486
He's bleeding.

00:25:57.028 --> 00:25:57.821
Wait,

00:25:58.613 --> 00:25:59.948
who is Jay-jay to you anyways?

00:26:03.451 --> 00:26:04.536
Why do you care

00:26:05.120 --> 00:26:06.246
what I do to her?!

00:26:06.746 --> 00:26:07.789
She's our classmate.

00:26:09.249 --> 00:26:10.250
She's our friend.

00:26:12.335 --> 00:26:13.670
She's part of our family.

00:26:15.088 --> 00:26:16.881
She belongs to Section E.

00:26:18.592 --> 00:26:20.093
And she's mine.

00:26:21.636 --> 00:26:23.013
You're the one she
replaced me with?

00:26:23.513 --> 00:26:25.015
You got played by
that woman too, huh?!

00:26:26.725 --> 00:26:27.726
Fucking asshole!

00:26:28.685 --> 00:26:30.478
Go, Keifer!

00:26:30.478 --> 00:26:31.271
Yuri!

00:26:32.022 --> 00:26:33.940
Stop him, Yuri.

00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:35.609
Cyrus might seriously get hurt!

00:26:36.192 --> 00:26:38.403
Keifer, that's enough!

00:26:38.695 --> 00:26:39.404
Why?

00:26:39.821 --> 00:26:41.031
He just got out from the hospital.

00:26:41.031 --> 00:26:42.449
Something might happen
to him again!

00:26:43.116 --> 00:26:45.910
Then let's put him
back in the hospital!

00:26:45.910 --> 00:26:47.162
Right!

00:26:51.041 --> 00:26:52.208
This poor bastard.

00:27:23.418 --> 00:27:24.586
What was that for?

00:27:25.538 --> 00:27:26.623
You owe me a kiss.

00:27:27.206 --> 00:27:30.501
You used profanity in the
classroom while eating chocolates.

00:27:31.919 --> 00:27:34.255
Keifer, can we please
get out of here.

00:27:40.470 --> 00:27:42.221
He's gonna cry.

00:27:42.513 --> 00:27:43.765
Are you crying?

00:27:45.183 --> 00:27:46.225
Can't get up, huh?

00:27:50.021 --> 00:27:51.522
Food, food!

00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:57.445
Let's eat already,
it's past lunch.

00:27:57.820 --> 00:27:59.656
We're the only ones left,
food's almost gone.

00:27:59.656 --> 00:28:01.240
Oh, fit check!

00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:04.035
Catwalk! Model!

00:28:04.869 --> 00:28:06.579
Hey, let's eat already!

00:28:06.579 --> 00:28:07.914
Wait, we'll just pose.

00:28:08.122 --> 00:28:09.332
Three, Two, One, go.

00:28:10.726 --> 00:28:11.852
You're so cringe!

00:28:11.877 --> 00:28:12.419
Whatever!

00:28:13.186 --> 00:28:14.271
Your shorts are ugly as hell.

00:28:14.730 --> 00:28:15.689
Wait a minute.

00:28:16.064 --> 00:28:17.190
Food!

00:28:19.109 --> 00:28:22.404
Wow, you forgot about me
already just because there's food.

00:28:24.197 --> 00:28:27.498
Here you go, Keifer—two pieces.

00:28:29.077 --> 00:28:29.870
Jay, hey.

00:28:30.829 --> 00:28:33.415
Are you sure you don't
want to go to the hospital?

00:28:34.207 --> 00:28:36.043
It might reach the organizers,

00:28:36.043 --> 00:28:37.377
and then things could get messy.

00:28:38.003 --> 00:28:40.172
The situation might get worse,
so don't bother.

00:28:41.089 --> 00:28:43.300
If you need anything,
just tell us.

00:28:55.654 --> 00:28:56.488
Are you hungry?

00:28:57.031 --> 00:28:58.407
Do you want me to get you-

00:29:10.999 --> 00:29:11.583
Eat.

00:29:13.426 --> 00:29:14.552
I'm not hungry.

00:29:16.012 --> 00:29:17.764
If you don't eat,

00:29:17.934 --> 00:29:19.310
I'll take you to the hospital.

00:29:22.177 --> 00:29:23.219
Why?

00:29:35.937 --> 00:29:37.772
Hey, where are you going, David?

00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:50.372
- Eat, Jay.
- He might be getting more food.

00:29:50.827 --> 00:29:52.579
You're asking for more
when there's barely anything left.

00:29:52.579 --> 00:29:53.955
I'm giving it away already.

00:29:58.251 --> 00:29:59.210
From now on,

00:29:59.210 --> 00:30:02.046
you are no longer allowed to go
out without someone by your side.

00:30:02.464 --> 00:30:05.383
Someone has to be with
you wherever you go.

00:30:05.842 --> 00:30:06.384
Got it?

00:30:07.969 --> 00:30:10.513
Huh? What for?

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:11.598
Look at what happened to you!

00:30:11.598 --> 00:30:12.724
What if we hadn't come earlier?

00:30:13.057 --> 00:30:14.855
You might've ended
up in the hospital!

00:30:15.852 --> 00:30:18.021
I didn't know that was
going to happen, okay.

00:30:18.021 --> 00:30:21.191
Besides, no one at
Holy Saints could hurt me.

00:30:21.191 --> 00:30:22.066
Really?

00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:24.402
What would you call what
that Cyrus guy did to you?

00:30:24.694 --> 00:30:26.404
I thought he was
confined in the hospital?

00:30:30.158 --> 00:30:31.993
He's been out for a few weeks already,

00:30:32.675 --> 00:30:35.136
and they let him back in school.

00:30:35.637 --> 00:30:36.512
You knew?

00:30:38.222 --> 00:30:39.682
Maybe you actually
planned to meet up!

00:30:40.391 --> 00:30:40.892
What?

00:30:42.143 --> 00:30:44.437
How would that even happen?
We don't communicate anymore,

00:30:44.437 --> 00:30:45.730
and we're not okay.

00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:46.773
So why did you go?

00:30:47.357 --> 00:30:49.776
Maybe you really
wanted to see Cyrus.

00:30:50.944 --> 00:30:53.071
And why would I
want to meet that-

00:30:57.533 --> 00:30:58.242
Wait.

00:30:59.827 --> 00:31:00.954
Are you guys jealous?

00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.163
- No!
- Yes!

00:31:03.623 --> 00:31:04.916
You two are so confusing.

00:31:05.083 --> 00:31:07.377
What's the real
reason you're angry?

00:31:07.710 --> 00:31:08.586
Isn't it obvious?

00:31:08.836 --> 00:31:10.546
We're mad because you got hurt,

00:31:10.546 --> 00:31:12.048
and we weren't there to protect you.

00:31:12.757 --> 00:31:13.466
Exactly.

00:31:15.468 --> 00:31:16.094
That's right.

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:19.722
How about you?

00:31:22.725 --> 00:31:23.351
Fine!

00:31:23.351 --> 00:31:25.103
Yes, I'm fucking jealous!

00:31:25.979 --> 00:31:26.562
Tell me,

00:31:26.562 --> 00:31:29.065
what guy would be happy
to hear that the girl he likes

00:31:29.065 --> 00:31:30.483
met up with her ex?

00:31:33.236 --> 00:31:34.570
Tell me, guys, am I right?

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:35.738
What would you feel?

00:31:35.738 --> 00:31:36.906
Rory, what would you feel?

00:31:36.906 --> 00:31:38.825
I'd feel extremely jealous!

00:31:38.825 --> 00:31:39.993
There you go.

00:31:40.535 --> 00:31:41.911
You, what would you feel?

00:31:41.911 --> 00:31:42.537
Felix?

00:31:42.537 --> 00:31:44.038
I'd cry.

00:31:45.456 --> 00:31:45.999
David?

00:31:46.153 --> 00:31:47.250
I'd feel the same.

00:31:47.667 --> 00:31:49.585
I'm with Keifer on this one.

00:31:51.546 --> 00:31:52.296
Thank you.

00:31:52.588 --> 00:31:53.006
Me?

00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:55.508
I might even kill Grace's ex.

00:31:55.508 --> 00:31:56.467
Oh, so that's why you
got her pregnant.

00:31:56.467 --> 00:31:57.885
Good thing Mica
doesn't have an ex!

00:31:58.177 --> 00:31:59.554
But if that was me,

00:31:59.887 --> 00:32:01.389
I'd skin that guy alive

00:32:01.389 --> 00:32:03.099
and bathe him with
onions and garlic.

00:32:04.183 --> 00:32:05.226
You're all crazy!

00:32:05.393 --> 00:32:06.477
Let me ask you this,

00:32:06.477 --> 00:32:08.062
is there anything to
be jealous about Cyrus?

00:32:08.062 --> 00:32:09.313
- Yes.
- He's tall.

00:32:09.313 --> 00:32:11.524
- He has a nice built.
- Yeah.

00:32:11.524 --> 00:32:12.775
That's it.

00:32:12.775 --> 00:32:14.152
- Is he handsome?
- No, that's just it.

00:32:14.152 --> 00:32:14.652
Yes.

00:32:15.069 --> 00:32:15.987
You guys are ridiculous.

00:32:19.699 --> 00:32:20.324
Jay,

00:32:21.034 --> 00:32:24.245
if you meet up with him
one more time and I find out

00:32:25.163 --> 00:32:27.415
I, myself, will lock
you in my house

00:32:27.415 --> 00:32:32.253
and make sure he does
not come anywhere near you.

00:32:32.253 --> 00:32:34.088
Let's just burn him alive.

00:32:35.173 --> 00:32:36.674
Perfect.

00:32:36.674 --> 00:32:38.176
Thank you so much. Exactly.

00:32:38.634 --> 00:32:40.178
That's what we'll do.

00:32:53.781 --> 00:32:55.067
I’m so bored.

00:32:55.068 --> 00:32:57.226
Why are not we
included in the activities?

00:32:59.072 --> 00:33:01.074
Edrix, the cooler it’s gone, bro!

00:33:01.074 --> 00:33:02.116
Wait, what? The cooler?!

00:33:02.116 --> 00:33:03.159
What do you mean?

00:33:04.508 --> 00:33:05.175
Damn it!

00:33:05.884 --> 00:33:07.135
- The cooler!
- What happened here?

00:33:07.135 --> 00:33:08.261
What are we going to drink?

00:33:08.553 --> 00:33:09.513
What the fuck?

00:33:09.513 --> 00:33:10.931
They actually robbed us!

00:33:10.931 --> 00:33:12.057
- Huh?
- No!

00:33:12.057 --> 00:33:13.642
Look at our tents.

00:33:13.642 --> 00:33:14.851
Who did this?

00:33:14.851 --> 00:33:16.645
Section E, search the tents!

00:33:16.645 --> 00:33:17.980
We have to drink tonight!

00:33:18.504 --> 00:33:19.356
Fuck.

00:33:19.356 --> 00:33:20.065
Ci-N!

00:33:21.274 --> 00:33:23.944
- My magazines!
- Who did this?

00:33:24.361 --> 00:33:25.821
Should we tell the organizer?

00:33:26.446 --> 00:33:27.698
Fucking shit!

00:33:27.698 --> 00:33:28.365
Hey, what's this?

00:33:30.450 --> 00:33:31.827
What?

00:33:31.827 --> 00:33:32.911
- What's that?
- It says "Marianel".

00:33:32.911 --> 00:33:33.453
Wait!

00:33:34.955 --> 00:33:35.998
"Marianel?"

00:33:36.497 --> 00:33:37.664
Ah, she's from Section A!

00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:39.291
She used to be my crush.

00:33:39.291 --> 00:33:41.960
How did a Section A
handkerchief end up here?

00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:43.170
Why are you asking us?

00:33:43.170 --> 00:33:45.798
- We came here at the same time.
- Did Section A steal from us?

00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:47.758
Section A?

00:33:48.342 --> 00:33:49.593
Jay-jay, look at my tent!

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:51.386
Oh no, it's completely destroyed!

00:33:51.595 --> 00:33:52.846
Unbelievable!

00:33:53.430 --> 00:33:55.057
They must really be jealous of you.

00:33:55.307 --> 00:33:56.767
I didn't even do anything to them.

00:33:56.767 --> 00:33:57.893
Should we report this?

00:33:58.185 --> 00:33:59.061
My stuff-

00:33:59.061 --> 00:34:00.646
It's gone.

00:34:00.646 --> 00:34:01.313
They took it.

00:34:01.688 --> 00:34:02.898
Even my stuffed toy?

00:34:03.524 --> 00:34:04.399
Gone too,

00:34:04.399 --> 00:34:05.859
but wait, I'll check again.

00:34:05.859 --> 00:34:06.860
- Just stay here.
- Huh?

00:34:09.071 --> 00:34:11.240
My stuffed toy!

00:34:11.949 --> 00:34:12.991
Please, check!

00:34:13.450 --> 00:34:15.244
Check if my stuffed toy is there.

00:34:15.702 --> 00:34:17.454
Hurry, it might have
fallen somewhere!

00:34:19.123 --> 00:34:20.666
I'm freaking out!

00:34:24.419 --> 00:34:25.170
Jay!!!

00:34:26.713 --> 00:34:28.006
There's a snake!!!

00:34:29.716 --> 00:34:31.218
What snake?!

00:34:31.802 --> 00:34:32.594
Are you sure?

00:34:32.594 --> 00:34:34.012
There really is, Jay!
I'm not joking!

00:34:34.012 --> 00:34:36.807
- Hey, careful Jay!
- Jay, watch out!

00:34:41.854 --> 00:34:42.271
Jay!

00:34:42.479 --> 00:34:43.981
- Wait!
- Move away from there!

00:34:43.981 --> 00:34:45.023
It's dead, anyways!

00:34:45.023 --> 00:34:46.191
It's all coiled up.

00:34:46.191 --> 00:34:46.775
Even so!

00:34:46.775 --> 00:34:47.818
- Let me check.
- Gross!

00:34:47.818 --> 00:34:48.902
Look first.

00:34:50.112 --> 00:34:51.989
What is that?
Are those hotdogs or meatloaf?

00:34:52.739 --> 00:34:53.782
Damn, it's huge.

00:34:54.032 --> 00:34:55.159
It's dead already.

00:35:00.539 --> 00:35:00.998
Jay!

00:35:01.915 --> 00:35:04.126
I know how we can
get back at Section A.

00:35:04.793 --> 00:35:05.460
How?

00:35:06.587 --> 00:35:07.379
Best friend,

00:35:08.297 --> 00:35:09.256
you handle this, okay?

00:35:10.674 --> 00:35:13.468
- Yuck!
- Disgusting, Ci!

00:35:13.468 --> 00:35:14.052
Disgusting.

00:35:14.303 --> 00:35:15.554
Guys!

00:35:15.679 --> 00:35:17.306
Let's all wake up early tomorrow.

00:35:17.306 --> 00:35:18.515
I have a plan, okay?

00:35:18.515 --> 00:35:19.349
Here, I'll explain.

00:35:19.349 --> 00:35:19.892
Edrix,

00:35:20.309 --> 00:35:21.310
wake up early.

00:35:22.102 --> 00:35:23.729
Wake up early, okay!

00:35:28.192 --> 00:35:29.985
Move quickly!

00:35:33.655 --> 00:35:34.907
Don’t make any noise.

00:35:37.451 --> 00:35:37.868
Shh!

00:35:37.868 --> 00:35:38.952
Ci-N, someone might see you.

00:35:38.952 --> 00:35:39.745
Get down.

00:35:40.621 --> 00:35:41.205
You're so loud.

00:35:43.472 --> 00:35:44.557
This is pointless.

00:35:44.557 --> 00:35:46.892
I already know
I don't trust you guys.

00:35:47.419 --> 00:35:49.338
Like who even are these two girls?

00:35:49.463 --> 00:35:50.923
They're not a part of my clique.

00:35:52.299 --> 00:35:53.818
Alright, here's the plan.

00:35:54.259 --> 00:35:55.928
Keifer, you go there.

00:35:56.136 --> 00:35:57.429
Back us up if needed.

00:35:58.024 --> 00:35:59.734
Yuri, you stay here.

00:35:59.734 --> 00:36:01.368
Watch over Jay-jay.

00:36:02.278 --> 00:36:03.196
Ci-N, you're with me.

00:36:04.405 --> 00:36:05.156
I wanna join too.

00:36:06.282 --> 00:36:07.033
Let's stay here.

00:36:11.245 --> 00:36:13.206
I wonder where
my stuffed toy is.

00:36:13.206 --> 00:36:15.291
I'll get it later.
For now, just stay here.

00:36:15.791 --> 00:36:18.336
Girls, today's activity is
called the trust fall.

00:36:18.336 --> 00:36:20.213
This is where your trust with
each other will be tested.

00:36:20.470 --> 00:36:21.554
Wait for me.

00:36:21.989 --> 00:36:24.408
So Freya, is the one in front.

00:36:25.284 --> 00:36:26.660
Uhh, fine.

00:36:27.369 --> 00:36:28.829
What’s the point?

00:36:31.999 --> 00:36:33.000
Faster.

00:36:34.749 --> 00:36:36.209
You guys better catch me,

00:36:36.209 --> 00:36:37.293
make sure you do.

00:36:37.293 --> 00:36:37.919
Ci-N!

00:36:38.669 --> 00:36:40.296
- The snake!
- Let's go? Okay!

00:36:40.755 --> 00:36:42.506
Wait, grab it!

00:36:44.133 --> 00:36:45.051
Wait!

00:36:45.259 --> 00:36:45.760
What?

00:36:47.094 --> 00:36:48.971
You got this, okay?

00:36:49.394 --> 00:36:51.354
We're counting on you,
get this done.

00:36:55.024 --> 00:36:55.733
Here we go.

00:36:55.733 --> 00:36:56.943
My gosh. Don't rush me.

00:36:56.943 --> 00:36:57.944
- Faster.
- Gosh, here it is.

00:36:57.944 --> 00:37:00.572
- Wait!
- On three, two…

00:37:00.572 --> 00:37:01.197
Okay.

00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:06.411
Wait!

00:37:06.411 --> 00:37:07.745
Is this even important?

00:37:08.663 --> 00:37:11.082
Yes, of course. Just go!

00:37:13.572 --> 00:37:14.949
You got this.

00:37:15.825 --> 00:37:17.201
You're taking too long.

00:37:27.544 --> 00:37:28.962
Yeah, you’re the queen bee.

00:37:28.962 --> 00:37:30.047
Freya, faster!

00:37:30.047 --> 00:37:31.590
I don't like this.

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:34.259
I'm literally like #TrustNoOne.

00:37:36.661 --> 00:37:39.956
- We've got you.
- Freya, we have to do this.

00:37:39.981 --> 00:37:40.690
Let's go.

00:37:45.037 --> 00:37:45.997
I'm brave,

00:37:46.128 --> 00:37:47.129
I'm bold,

00:37:47.523 --> 00:37:48.149
Yes, you are bold!

00:37:48.149 --> 00:37:51.235
- I'm not scared of anything!
- David, hurry up.

00:37:55.197 --> 00:37:56.365
The fuck?

00:38:05.166 --> 00:38:06.208
I'll go get your things.

00:38:13.674 --> 00:38:15.342
We're awesome, bro!

00:38:15.801 --> 00:38:17.845
Hey, I high-fived you!
Why’d you leave me hanging?

00:38:22.099 --> 00:38:22.892
Yuri!

00:38:24.081 --> 00:38:25.458
Here it is! Jay!

00:38:28.187 --> 00:38:28.729
Look!

00:38:31.422 --> 00:38:32.047
Is it all complete?

00:38:38.290 --> 00:38:39.249
Boys, where are you guys?

00:38:39.249 --> 00:38:39.791
Hello, Keifer.

00:38:39.791 --> 00:38:41.293
We're already at the
Section A meeting hall.

00:38:42.419 --> 00:38:43.503
How are the other sections?

00:38:44.046 --> 00:38:46.340
We got back the other
stuff from their halls,

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:48.842
and confirmed,
our food is in Section D.

00:38:48.842 --> 00:38:51.094
Good thing Section C
didn't join in.

00:38:51.595 --> 00:38:52.512
We're all together right now.

00:38:52.512 --> 00:38:53.096
All good?

00:38:53.096 --> 00:38:54.014
We’ll go there.

00:38:54.139 --> 00:38:54.806
Alright.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.022
Yes.

00:39:02.356 --> 00:39:03.899
Nice!

[Section E cheering]

Bestie! Bestie!

00:39:35.983 --> 00:39:36.943
What is this?

00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:39.737
Hey, uglies!

00:39:46.536 --> 00:39:47.662
Hey, handsome.

00:39:47.662 --> 00:39:49.414
- Yes?
- Calling me, bro?

00:39:50.832 --> 00:39:53.126
The audacity!

00:39:53.126 --> 00:39:55.378
You're all so fake.

00:39:55.795 --> 00:39:57.755
You didn't even help Jay-jay.

00:39:57.755 --> 00:39:58.381
Right!

00:39:58.381 --> 00:39:59.298
Help this one.

00:39:59.549 --> 00:40:01.259
Hey, someone needs to share with

00:40:01.259 --> 00:40:02.718
Ci-N, Jay-jay, and David, okay?

00:40:03.010 --> 00:40:03.719
I’ll handle it.

00:40:03.928 --> 00:40:05.471
I'll handle it so it doesn't get too messy.

00:40:06.472 --> 00:40:07.765
David, go with Kit & Josh.

00:40:07.765 --> 00:40:10.184
Then let's make a makeshift
tent for Jay over there.

00:40:10.685 --> 00:40:11.561
Do you all agree?

00:40:13.271 --> 00:40:14.439
Jay and I will just share a tent.

00:40:15.231 --> 00:40:15.731
Sure.

00:40:15.731 --> 00:40:17.150
I thought we were
going to play?

00:40:17.358 --> 00:40:18.901
You can handle that,
do it solo.

00:40:22.029 --> 00:40:22.613
No.

00:40:24.449 --> 00:40:25.283
Why?

00:40:25.783 --> 00:40:26.993
It's okay with me.

00:40:27.285 --> 00:40:29.620
Besides, Ci-N and I have already
stayed in a room together before.

00:40:29.745 --> 00:40:30.163
Jay,

00:40:31.164 --> 00:40:33.332
you're a girl and
Ci-N is still a guy.

00:40:33.332 --> 00:40:34.792
So it's a no for me.

00:40:36.878 --> 00:40:39.213
So what? It's Ci-N.

00:40:42.175 --> 00:40:43.050
Honestly,

00:40:43.455 --> 00:40:46.207
I miss my bonding nights with Ci.

00:40:46.833 --> 00:40:49.794
I would love to hear about
his life now at his condo.

00:40:52.922 --> 00:40:53.590
No.

00:40:54.758 --> 00:40:57.344
No one shares a tent with Jay-jay.

00:40:58.873 --> 00:40:59.332
Except...

00:41:00.625 --> 00:41:01.876
me, of course.

00:41:04.212 --> 00:41:05.129
How about no?

00:41:06.172 --> 00:41:09.050
I think no one should
share a tent with Jay-jay.

00:41:10.756 --> 00:41:11.382
Enough!

00:41:11.716 --> 00:41:12.925
You better stop now.

00:41:15.177 --> 00:41:15.720
Fine.

00:41:17.346 --> 00:41:20.099
Nobody shares a tent with Jay-jay.

00:41:20.973 --> 00:41:24.769
Here's a better idea,
let Jay-jay decide.

00:41:24.794 --> 00:41:25.544
Makes sense.

00:41:28.820 --> 00:41:32.281
Ah, Ci-N then.

00:41:33.116 --> 00:41:33.866
If that's okay.

00:41:34.826 --> 00:41:35.493
Fine.

00:41:35.881 --> 00:41:36.382
Fine.

Yeah, one showed up at our campsite, too!

00:42:48.349 --> 00:42:49.100
I'm fine,

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:50.184
how about you?

00:42:50.518 --> 00:42:52.353
Do you have a snake
at your campsite too?

00:42:53.187 --> 00:42:53.646
Yeah.

00:42:54.313 --> 00:42:55.147
We don't!

00:42:58.359 --> 00:42:59.902
Hey, what's that on your neck?

00:43:01.028 --> 00:43:01.988
Is that a bruise?

00:43:03.406 --> 00:43:04.574
It is a bruise!

00:43:07.118 --> 00:43:08.369
Is someone hurting you?

00:43:10.329 --> 00:43:10.955
No!

00:43:11.872 --> 00:43:12.790
It’s just...

00:43:14.792 --> 00:43:17.253
I got it during the
whole snake commotion.

00:43:18.379 --> 00:43:19.505
Keifer did that, am I right?

00:43:19.505 --> 00:43:20.506
Huh? No!

00:43:22.383 --> 00:43:24.969
You know, Jay, you don't have
to hide anything from me.

00:43:25.344 --> 00:43:27.013
I know you're in a relationship,

00:43:27.513 --> 00:43:28.973
and I know it's with Keifer.

00:43:30.141 --> 00:43:31.684
So if he's hurting you,

00:43:32.101 --> 00:43:33.728
it's better to let me know.

00:43:35.146 --> 00:43:37.273
Keifer didn't do this.

00:43:38.482 --> 00:43:41.235
Someone did hurt me,
but it wasn't him.

00:43:42.236 --> 00:43:45.489
And why would you think that?

00:43:45.948 --> 00:43:47.158
That's just how he is.

00:43:47.658 --> 00:43:49.327
He does that when he's jealous.

00:43:51.068 --> 00:43:51.902
Does what?

00:43:53.404 --> 00:43:54.071
To whom?

00:43:56.866 --> 00:43:57.783
To Freya.

00:44:00.536 --> 00:44:01.328
How?

00:44:02.913 --> 00:44:05.416
Well, Freya was already
being difficult back then.

00:44:05.416 --> 00:44:08.210
But that's not enough
reason to hurt someone.

00:44:08.794 --> 00:44:10.629
Keifer's crazy.

00:44:12.173 --> 00:44:13.841
But seriously,
have that checked, okay?

00:44:14.592 --> 00:44:17.511
Yes, it will go away anyways.
It will heal.

00:44:26.879 --> 00:44:28.297
You're sure, it wasn't Keifer?

00:44:28.589 --> 00:44:29.924
It's not him.

00:44:34.136 --> 00:44:36.430
Okay, fix yourself up.

00:44:47.281 --> 00:44:48.365
[Section E cheering]

00:44:48.365 --> 00:44:50.200

00:44:52.425 --> 00:44:54.511
Hey! They might run
out of food again!

00:44:54.511 --> 00:44:57.013
They're really targeting the pancit,
hope you don't live long!

00:44:57.722 --> 00:44:58.640
Is this it?

00:45:01.977 --> 00:45:03.061
- Do you want vegetables?
- No!

00:45:03.497 --> 00:45:04.498
It's delicious!

00:45:07.293 --> 00:45:08.085
Too bad,

00:45:08.836 --> 00:45:10.129
it didn't spill.

00:45:10.713 --> 00:45:11.338
Freya,

00:45:12.173 --> 00:45:12.923
don't make a—

00:45:12.923 --> 00:45:13.883
Shut it, Mica.

00:45:15.593 --> 00:45:16.135
So,

00:45:17.805 --> 00:45:19.557
what's this I've been hearing?

00:45:20.205 --> 00:45:21.623
You and…

00:45:23.924 --> 00:45:26.343
What a great choice.

00:45:31.570 --> 00:45:33.029
Freya, that's enough.

00:45:33.822 --> 00:45:35.031
I don't want trouble, Freya.

00:45:36.575 --> 00:45:37.659
Oh, really?

00:45:38.243 --> 00:45:40.787
Well, trouble is exactly what I want.

00:45:40.787 --> 00:45:41.538
Freya!

00:45:41.997 --> 00:45:42.831
Please!

00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:46.829
You really think
you're so pretty, huh.

00:45:46.829 --> 00:45:48.039
Freya, stop it!

00:45:48.223 --> 00:45:51.518
Shut the fuck up and don't you
dare interrupt me while I'm talking!

00:45:54.793 --> 00:45:56.420
You think I don't know
anything about you guys?

00:45:58.714 --> 00:45:59.757
What is your problem?!

00:46:00.215 --> 00:46:00.924
You!

00:46:01.300 --> 00:46:03.761
You're my problem because
you're such a flirt!

00:46:03.761 --> 00:46:04.344
Wow!

00:46:04.803 --> 00:46:06.221
Coming from you?

00:46:06.388 --> 00:46:07.931
What the fuck is your problem, Freya?

00:46:07.931 --> 00:46:09.099
Can you just stop already?!

00:46:11.769 --> 00:46:13.520
Why are you talking
to me like that?

00:46:16.523 --> 00:46:18.692
Your brother wouldn't like
that tone of yours.

00:46:19.568 --> 00:46:20.319
Brother?

00:46:20.893 --> 00:46:22.478
Is she talking about Percy?

00:46:23.062 --> 00:46:24.522
Why is Percy being dragged into this?

00:46:24.939 --> 00:46:25.731
What's going on?

00:46:26.273 --> 00:46:27.817
Does she also know
that Percy is alive?

00:46:27.817 --> 00:46:29.443
Freya, my brother's long gone.

00:46:30.111 --> 00:46:31.278
Your relationship ended
a long time ago too.

00:46:32.780 --> 00:46:33.739
Relationship ended?

00:46:34.156 --> 00:46:34.949
What?!

00:46:37.507 --> 00:46:39.175
Percy?

00:46:45.515 --> 00:46:47.267
So you've heard of him, huh?

00:46:48.003 --> 00:46:49.296
Let me guess.

00:46:50.589 --> 00:46:52.174
You heard it from your...

00:46:53.341 --> 00:46:54.676
friends.

00:46:59.598 --> 00:47:02.934
So did your friends also
tell you what they did to me?

00:47:03.727 --> 00:47:04.227
Huh?

00:47:05.823 --> 00:47:06.907
What they did to you?

00:47:09.303 --> 00:47:10.220
Yeah.

00:47:16.149 --> 00:47:17.150
That's enough, Freya.

00:47:17.567 --> 00:47:18.401
Enough?

00:47:19.277 --> 00:47:20.111
Why?

00:47:21.279 --> 00:47:22.489
You don't want others to hear?

00:47:24.407 --> 00:47:25.492
What do you want?

00:47:26.034 --> 00:47:28.870
I want to see your reaction

00:47:29.370 --> 00:47:30.538
when you find out--

00:47:30.895 --> 00:47:31.563
Hey!

00:47:31.656 --> 00:47:33.783
… what those two did to me.

00:47:41.044 --> 00:47:41.753
Fuck!

00:47:51.220 --> 00:47:52.096
What was that about?

00:47:54.265 --> 00:47:55.975
Jay, we're all tired and hungry.

00:47:56.392 --> 00:47:58.269
Can we please just
talk about it later?

00:47:58.269 --> 00:47:59.520
Why not now?

00:47:59.520 --> 00:48:00.605
Jay, please.

00:48:01.189 --> 00:48:02.440
Why? What was that about?

00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:03.816
Because that was a mistake!

00:48:04.150 --> 00:48:06.361
It was just a mistake
we made back then!

00:48:07.111 --> 00:48:08.488
Why do you even need
to know about it?

00:48:09.989 --> 00:48:10.865
Right,

00:48:11.866 --> 00:48:13.368
why am I even asking?

00:48:13.910 --> 00:48:15.954
Why am I even getting
myself involved again?

00:48:16.204 --> 00:48:17.288
Who am I to you anyways?!

00:48:19.374 --> 00:48:20.041
Hey, where are you gong?

00:48:20.166 --> 00:48:20.708
Jay!

00:48:21.334 --> 00:48:22.001
I don't know!

00:48:22.001 --> 00:48:23.086
Just somewhere far away from you!

00:48:48.069 --> 00:48:50.571
Good thing this is still here.

00:48:50.738 --> 00:48:51.948
There, this is how it should be.

00:48:51.948 --> 00:48:54.242
Relaxing, peaceful-

00:48:57.912 --> 00:48:58.621
Who's that?

00:48:59.831 --> 00:49:01.374
Looks like someone's relapsing.

00:49:04.836 --> 00:49:06.254
I'll join you, sis.

[girl sobbing]

Ahem!

00:49:39.437 --> 00:49:40.021
What?

00:49:40.730 --> 00:49:41.728
What do you want?

00:49:52.033 --> 00:49:53.869
If you're here because of
what happened earlier,

00:49:55.245 --> 00:49:56.288
just leave.

00:49:57.539 --> 00:49:59.165
I'm not in the mood
to argue anymore.

00:50:05.797 --> 00:50:06.381
Freya.

00:50:08.245 --> 00:50:09.371
What?

00:50:11.748 --> 00:50:12.749
That thing...

00:50:15.463 --> 00:50:16.965
that thing you said earlier,

00:50:17.723 --> 00:50:20.768
I didn't really understand.

00:50:27.937 --> 00:50:30.189
Didn't your friends already tell you?

00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:34.489
Then again…

00:50:36.696 --> 00:50:39.532
I'd be more surprised
if they actually did tell you.

00:50:41.576 --> 00:50:42.493
What is it?

00:50:42.493 --> 00:50:44.537
Keifer and Yuri

00:50:46.778 --> 00:50:47.904
are my exes.

00:50:53.038 --> 00:50:54.790
After Percy died,

00:50:57.413 --> 00:50:59.665
Yuri was the first
one who came to me.

00:51:02.418 --> 00:51:03.878
He supported me.

00:51:04.754 --> 00:51:06.338
Showed me that he was
always there for me.

00:51:06.721 --> 00:51:07.639
Anytime.

00:51:07.639 --> 00:51:08.556

Do you wanna join?

00:51:13.074 --> 00:51:14.492
I really fell for him.

00:51:17.433 --> 00:51:18.225
And then...

00:51:18.225 --> 00:51:19.495
By the way, here's your drink.

00:51:19.520 --> 00:51:21.147
...he took what he wanted.

00:51:22.773 --> 00:51:24.149
Let’s break up.

00:51:24.149 --> 00:51:26.818
Just like every guy wants.

00:51:34.534 --> 00:51:36.161
He left me.

00:51:37.829 --> 00:51:41.875
What he did was unforgivable.

00:51:49.927 --> 00:51:51.261
Then, Keifer showed up...

00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:55.450
taking the spotlight.

00:51:55.475 --> 00:51:56.976
[students cheering for Freya]

00:51:56.976 --> 00:51:59.562
At first, I even thought
I should be grateful to him.

00:52:02.922 --> 00:52:05.675
But I was so fucking wrong.

00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:11.872
He treated me like a queen.

00:52:11.872 --> 00:52:14.166
He saved me.

00:52:15.047 --> 00:52:18.675
Only a few people knew
we were together.

00:52:20.635 --> 00:52:22.721
But all changed,

00:52:23.638 --> 00:52:24.890
when he realized

00:52:25.734 --> 00:52:27.111
that it was still Yuri.

00:52:27.319 --> 00:52:29.113
Congrats, Freya!
You did so well!

00:52:31.907 --> 00:52:35.452
He was so consumed by jealousy.

That's enough! Everyone out!

00:52:40.165 --> 00:52:42.793
Get out! Out, now!

Keifer…

00:52:46.294 --> 00:52:47.546
what's your problem?

00:52:47.546 --> 00:52:49.131
So you're enjoying it, aren't you?

00:52:50.298 --> 00:52:51.007
They were just greeting me.

00:52:51.007 --> 00:52:51.925
Just greeting you?!

00:52:51.925 --> 00:52:53.969
It got to a point where...

00:52:55.637 --> 00:52:57.430
He laid a hand on me.

00:52:57.848 --> 00:53:00.350
You don't go anywhere
without my permission!

00:53:00.767 --> 00:53:03.019
And you're not allowed to leave
the house unless I'm with you!

00:53:05.522 --> 00:53:06.690
Don't you ever

00:53:06.982 --> 00:53:08.733
ever try to disobey me!

00:53:14.373 --> 00:53:14.999
So,

00:53:16.042 --> 00:53:17.084
what did I do?

00:53:22.548 --> 00:53:24.216
I went out with other guys.

00:53:26.010 --> 00:53:27.803
We fought all the time,

00:53:28.554 --> 00:53:29.581
every day.

00:53:30.723 --> 00:53:32.183
Until he got tired of it...

00:53:35.436 --> 00:53:36.896
and broke up with me.

00:53:40.941 --> 00:53:43.819
In wanting to know the truth,

00:53:44.695 --> 00:53:46.405
here I am, getting hurt.

00:53:47.156 --> 00:53:49.909
It hurts when secrets
are kept from you.

00:53:50.910 --> 00:53:53.245
But it hurts even more
to hear the truth.

00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:56.999
It feels so heavy.

00:54:00.252 --> 00:54:03.089
And then people started
calling me a bitch,

00:54:03.422 --> 00:54:04.715
a slut, a whore.

00:54:09.553 --> 00:54:10.971
If only they knew the truth.

00:54:10.971 --> 00:54:12.473
If only you knew the truth.

00:54:16.185 --> 00:54:18.312
Would you still be so
quick to judge me?

00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:21.816
What did Keifer use to say again?

00:54:22.817 --> 00:54:26.112
Ah, curiosity kills the cat.

00:54:28.864 --> 00:54:30.282
Fucking pathetic.

00:54:38.290 --> 00:54:38.749
Don't.

00:54:41.127 --> 00:54:42.753
I don't need your fake sympathy.

00:55:41.438 --> 00:55:42.147
There she is!

00:55:42.356 --> 00:55:42.856
Jay!

00:55:49.486 --> 00:55:50.487
Three, two, one!

00:55:54.618 --> 00:55:55.327
Where have you been?

00:55:55.744 --> 00:55:56.495
Angelo.

00:55:56.495 --> 00:55:57.871
Cyrus' parents called me.

00:55:58.288 --> 00:55:59.289
They said he was taken
to the hospital,

00:55:59.289 --> 00:56:00.248
along with his friends.

00:56:00.374 --> 00:56:01.375
Did you have anything
to do with that?

00:56:01.375 --> 00:56:02.376
Well—

00:56:02.376 --> 00:56:03.960
You're having one of your
crazy episodes, aren't you?

00:56:04.211 --> 00:56:05.796
I know you have
something to say.

00:56:06.046 --> 00:56:07.964
Did you really hurt Freya?

00:56:09.841 --> 00:56:10.592
I did.

00:56:11.385 --> 00:56:13.929
You animal!
Why don't you untie me!

00:56:13.954 --> 00:56:15.205
Nice one, barracuda.

00:56:15.472 --> 00:56:23.438
[Section E cheering]

00:56:23.438 --> 00:56:28.068
Ci-N!

00:56:28.068 --> 00:56:28.902
Truth or dare?

00:56:29.486 --> 00:56:30.404
Fine, truth.

00:56:30.654 --> 00:56:32.489
When did you start liking Jay-jay?

00:56:32.489 --> 00:56:35.534
Maybe during her first
few weeks in Section E.

00:56:35.534 --> 00:56:37.327
When are you planning to tell us

00:56:37.327 --> 00:56:39.204
about your engagement to Jay-jay?

00:56:39.329 --> 00:56:41.540
Huh?!
