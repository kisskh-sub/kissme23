WEBVTT

00:00:28.987 --> 00:00:29.988
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:30.071 --> 00:00:31.072
ALL MINORS WERE FILMED IN COMPLIANCE
WITH STANDARD PRODUCTION GUIDELINES

00:00:32.115 --> 00:00:35.827
MUJOO DOCK, INCHEON

00:00:41.041 --> 00:00:42.042
I'll take one.

00:00:42.125 --> 00:00:43.251
It's 5,000 won.

00:00:52.302 --> 00:00:54.471
MUJOO DOCK

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:07.734
Disguised truck approaching.

00:01:26.127 --> 00:01:27.754
Stay in position
and behave naturally.

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:42.393
Stand by until I give you a sign.

00:01:49.692 --> 00:01:52.028
Jang Joong-hyuk is in the black van
right behind the box truck.

00:01:57.617 --> 00:01:59.035
Here are the two things

00:01:59.828 --> 00:02:01.788
that give me the most joy in life.

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:03.957
First. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:06.876
Screwing up the assholes

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:08.837
who don't pay me back
after borrowing from me.

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:09.921
Second.

00:02:11.589 --> 00:02:12.757
Cutting the throat

00:02:14.259 --> 00:02:16.052
of the girl who looks down on me,
you bitch.

00:02:16.136 --> 00:02:17.137
Hey, bring me a knife.

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:18.221
- Hey, knife.
- Yes, sir.

00:02:20.515 --> 00:02:21.516
Joong-ki!

00:02:22.684 --> 00:02:24.644
- Bring me a box cutter.
- Bring a box cutter. Here.

00:02:28.106 --> 00:02:30.024
Joong-ki, slice her aorta.

00:02:30.108 --> 00:02:31.401
The aorta?

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:33.778
J!

00:02:35.905 --> 00:02:37.532
He'll show up disguised as a driver.

00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:55.383
You see a taxi nearby, right?

00:02:55.466 --> 00:02:57.302
J is inside, in disguise.

00:03:00.388 --> 00:03:01.514
J is disguised inside the taxi.

00:03:01.598 --> 00:03:02.765
I'll take him.

00:03:02.849 --> 00:03:04.142
Everyone else,
go after Jang Joong-hyuk.

00:03:06.227 --> 00:03:08.021
Back it up and slam into the taxi.

00:03:22.869 --> 00:03:24.704
Whoever has the flash drive

00:03:24.787 --> 00:03:27.707
must be sealed away with it forever
and never come back into the world.

00:03:37.425 --> 00:03:38.426
Jang Joong-hyuk!

00:03:43.056 --> 00:03:44.182
Darn it.

00:03:56.444 --> 00:03:57.445
Come here.

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.284
Don't make a move. Don't come closer.

00:04:05.370 --> 00:04:06.412
Stay back!

00:04:11.084 --> 00:04:13.002
Jang Joong-hyuk
holds Soo-hyun hostage

00:04:13.336 --> 00:04:14.754
while confronting the NIS.

00:04:19.676 --> 00:04:20.677
Get in.

00:04:28.977 --> 00:04:29.978
Go.

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:32.105
Let's go!

00:04:36.901 --> 00:04:37.902
Follow him!

00:04:45.326 --> 00:04:47.203
Boss, I'm ready to go.

00:04:47.287 --> 00:04:50.123
When will the box truck
with 500 billion won drive by?

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.541
Please respond.

00:04:52.542 --> 00:04:54.043
I need your order.

00:04:54.627 --> 00:04:56.212
There's over a 90% chance

00:04:56.296 --> 00:05:00.383
Joong-hyuk will use the road to reach
Incheon Port container terminal

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.720
but just in case,
I need you to go to the dock, Fixer.

00:05:03.803 --> 00:05:04.804
Yes, Boss.

00:05:10.435 --> 00:05:11.436
What happened?

00:05:13.563 --> 00:05:14.897
What happened?

00:05:15.189 --> 00:05:17.066
I almost died just now,
so I couldn't see everything

00:05:17.317 --> 00:05:19.152
but it looks like
he took Soo-hyun hostage.

00:06:05.239 --> 00:06:07.492
EPISODE 8: THE LAST CARD;
A WORLD OF REVERSED TRUTHS

00:06:10.244 --> 00:06:12.663
I'm not saying
I won't give you the money.

00:06:12.747 --> 00:06:15.458
A lot of eyes are on us,
so we can't act hastily.

00:06:15.792 --> 00:06:18.294
I mean, we aren't strangers, are we?

00:06:37.522 --> 00:06:39.482
Should I thank you

00:06:40.024 --> 00:06:43.820
for those 500 billion won?

00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:46.864
I mean

00:06:47.698 --> 00:06:49.325
your misunderstanding

00:06:49.409 --> 00:06:51.869
became the trigger
for making those supernotes.

00:06:51.953 --> 00:06:53.913
And thanks to you,
I got to take all 500 billion.

00:06:53.996 --> 00:06:54.997
"Misunderstanding"?

00:06:58.126 --> 00:06:59.168
What if

00:07:00.044 --> 00:07:01.504
I didn't blow up

00:07:02.588 --> 00:07:05.925
that warehouse with a bang

00:07:06.008 --> 00:07:07.427
five years ago?

00:07:08.261 --> 00:07:10.972
Then you wouldn't have had
a reason to make those supernotes.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:15.101
Look at that.

00:07:19.897 --> 00:07:21.732
Unbelievable.

00:07:23.818 --> 00:07:26.988
I took a wild guess
and thought I'd feel you out.

00:07:30.491 --> 00:07:31.951
But you really didn't know.

00:07:33.369 --> 00:07:34.996
Did you crawl your way
into the NIS because of J?

00:07:35.079 --> 00:07:36.080
To get revenge?

00:07:37.415 --> 00:07:38.833
J wasn't behind the explosion...

00:07:40.877 --> 00:07:43.254
at the warehouse,
but it was just you and you alone?

00:07:46.507 --> 00:07:47.508
I did it.

00:07:52.972 --> 00:07:54.599
I guess you didn't know.

00:07:59.854 --> 00:08:01.481
Thanks for the present.

00:08:07.862 --> 00:08:09.530
J

00:08:11.365 --> 00:08:14.118
2013, INCHEON

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:20.708
Why won't he pick up?

00:08:34.388 --> 00:08:35.723
- Who's that?
- Hey.

00:08:36.182 --> 00:08:38.226
- Who the heck are you?
- You fucking bastards.

00:08:38.309 --> 00:08:39.310
What the fuck?

00:08:44.065 --> 00:08:45.066
What's going on?

00:08:45.149 --> 00:08:46.359
Hey, someone's here.

00:08:52.323 --> 00:08:54.033
You fucking asshole!

00:09:17.682 --> 00:09:19.892
Man, come on.

00:09:20.851 --> 00:09:22.228
You punk.

00:09:22.311 --> 00:09:23.896
Hey, that's enough.

00:09:24.564 --> 00:09:26.190
My nose hurts. It stings.

00:09:27.525 --> 00:09:28.985
Who the heck is this punk?

00:09:30.152 --> 00:09:32.572
Man, you startled me.

00:09:33.489 --> 00:09:35.199
Hey.

00:09:35.283 --> 00:09:36.951
Why did you all run out
just to take down a kid?

00:09:38.202 --> 00:09:39.537
Let go of me, punk!

00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:40.746
Where's Mr. Yang?

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.124
Hey, get him off me! Damn it.

00:09:43.624 --> 00:09:44.625
Hey.

00:09:45.835 --> 00:09:47.587
Let go. Get him off.

00:09:48.588 --> 00:09:49.589
Let's go.

00:09:49.672 --> 00:09:51.048
I can't believe all of you ran out

00:09:51.132 --> 00:09:52.842
with those metal pipes
to take down this kid.

00:09:52.925 --> 00:09:54.051
You should be embarrassed.

00:09:54.468 --> 00:09:55.845
Get in.

00:10:01.142 --> 00:10:02.685
No, wait. Fuck...

00:10:04.228 --> 00:10:05.229
Hey!

00:10:08.274 --> 00:10:09.275
Hey.

00:10:11.944 --> 00:10:13.195
Hey! Damn it.

00:10:13.279 --> 00:10:14.280
Hey!

00:10:14.739 --> 00:10:15.740
Hey, where's Mr. Yang?

00:10:17.199 --> 00:10:18.200
And Soo-hyun!

00:10:31.297 --> 00:10:32.298
Mr. Yang!

00:10:33.466 --> 00:10:34.675
Han Soo-hyun!

00:10:34.759 --> 00:10:35.801
Darn it.

00:11:00.660 --> 00:11:01.661
Soo-hyun.

00:11:06.123 --> 00:11:07.124
Han Soo-hyun.

00:11:12.546 --> 00:11:13.756
Fuck this.

00:11:14.048 --> 00:11:15.299
Man, fuck this.

00:11:23.349 --> 00:11:24.350
Soo-hyun.

00:11:24.767 --> 00:11:25.768
Mr. Yang.

00:11:26.769 --> 00:11:27.770
Mr. Yang.

00:11:28.396 --> 00:11:29.397
Mr. Yang.

00:11:30.731 --> 00:11:31.816
Mr. Yang.

00:11:56.716 --> 00:11:57.883
Mr. Yang?

00:12:04.598 --> 00:12:06.642
Yang Dosa.

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:08.811
Yang Dosa!

00:13:33.145 --> 00:13:34.146
J?

00:13:44.615 --> 00:13:45.825
Mr. Yang!

00:15:07.156 --> 00:15:08.574
Please wait just a little.

00:15:10.951 --> 00:15:12.536
I'll orchestrate something new.

00:15:26.717 --> 00:15:28.344
Anyway

00:15:30.137 --> 00:15:33.641
I always thought you and J

00:15:33.933 --> 00:15:36.810
were up to dirty tricks together.

00:15:37.102 --> 00:15:39.939
- What did you say, bastard?
- That bastard

00:15:40.022 --> 00:15:42.900
he completely loses it
whenever he's with you.

00:15:43.150 --> 00:15:44.985
He always keeps calm
with everything else.

00:15:45.235 --> 00:15:46.362
Wait and see

00:15:47.071 --> 00:15:51.033
whether he comes here
to find you or not.

00:15:51.992 --> 00:15:53.744
You fucking bastards.

00:16:32.866 --> 00:16:35.494
Boss, is everything all right?

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:37.746
What about the 500 billion won?

00:16:39.415 --> 00:16:42.668
They're getting ready
to load it into a container.

00:16:44.253 --> 00:16:46.088
Boss, I'm on standby with her.

00:16:47.381 --> 00:16:48.382
All right.

00:16:49.258 --> 00:16:50.259
You two.

00:16:51.051 --> 00:16:52.386
Listen carefully to my words.

00:16:53.178 --> 00:16:54.638
You two need to meet

00:16:55.222 --> 00:16:58.308
with the customs officer
Jang Joong-hyuk has bribed.

00:16:58.392 --> 00:16:59.393
And...

00:17:01.020 --> 00:17:02.021
Boss.

00:17:02.813 --> 00:17:03.814
Yes?

00:17:07.067 --> 00:17:08.902
Hey, stash her inside.

00:17:19.788 --> 00:17:21.415
I hope you live a long life.

00:17:25.753 --> 00:17:29.256
Goodness, you have such an odd taste.

00:17:29.339 --> 00:17:31.508
It must sting so much
in that salty water.

00:17:31.592 --> 00:17:33.427
You could've just had fish stew.

00:17:33.510 --> 00:17:34.595
How did it go?

00:17:36.346 --> 00:17:39.808
We need to pay in full
before loading it into the container.

00:18:26.438 --> 00:18:28.315
Hey, there.

00:18:28.398 --> 00:18:30.109
How are you all doing?

00:18:37.991 --> 00:18:39.034
SEAWEED

00:18:40.202 --> 00:18:41.411
These are for you.

00:18:41.495 --> 00:18:43.163
I hope you like dried seaweed.

00:18:43.664 --> 00:18:44.665
What are these?

00:18:45.499 --> 00:18:47.501
Your favorite, money.

00:18:48.043 --> 00:18:49.253
Six hundred million won each.

00:18:52.464 --> 00:18:54.133
What about my money?

00:18:54.883 --> 00:18:57.010
We kept it safely in there.

00:18:57.636 --> 00:18:59.513
In an hour, we'll load it
in the shipping container

00:18:59.596 --> 00:19:00.806
and send it to the dock.

00:19:02.975 --> 00:19:03.976
From now on

00:19:04.935 --> 00:19:07.187
I will move with my money.

00:19:07.479 --> 00:19:09.815
Do you mean you want to get in
the container with the money?

00:19:09.898 --> 00:19:10.899
Yes.

00:19:10.983 --> 00:19:13.819
It takes all day just to reach
the Port of Lianyungang, China.

00:19:13.902 --> 00:19:15.028
On top of that

00:19:15.112 --> 00:19:17.072
the space is tight,
full of other shipments.

00:19:17.156 --> 00:19:19.032
You won't be able to move at all.

00:19:19.116 --> 00:19:20.534
He's right, Boss.

00:19:21.034 --> 00:19:22.744
Why would you do that?
It's a stretch.

00:19:22.828 --> 00:19:24.079
Joong-ki.

00:19:24.621 --> 00:19:27.624
I have to do that much
to protect my money.

00:19:28.208 --> 00:19:29.209
Right?

00:19:30.085 --> 00:19:31.837
You should go get something to eat.

00:19:33.005 --> 00:19:36.216
All right. Let's go!

00:19:52.274 --> 00:19:53.275
J!

00:19:55.861 --> 00:19:57.571
Darn it.

00:19:57.654 --> 00:19:59.156
I thought he'd show up

00:19:59.489 --> 00:20:00.699
but he didn't.

00:20:02.576 --> 00:20:04.203
You've kept her around for a while.

00:20:04.286 --> 00:20:05.370
Who is she?

00:20:07.164 --> 00:20:08.749
The best in the industry

00:20:09.333 --> 00:20:10.500
at counterfeiting money.

00:20:11.668 --> 00:20:13.587
The best in the industry

00:20:13.670 --> 00:20:15.464
at drug manufacturing.

00:20:15.547 --> 00:20:18.050
We're going to rake in
every single penny from China!

00:20:24.306 --> 00:20:25.724
There's no one to let go of.

00:20:27.601 --> 00:20:29.603
Bring them both.

00:20:31.063 --> 00:20:32.064
Let go of me.

00:20:41.740 --> 00:20:43.075
What is this?

00:20:55.587 --> 00:20:57.881
Why are there so many fatties here?

00:21:01.051 --> 00:21:02.052
Hey!

00:21:02.636 --> 00:21:03.971
You came for Soo-hyun, didn't you?

00:21:04.054 --> 00:21:06.181
I came to retrieve my 500 billion.

00:21:06.265 --> 00:21:08.517
For both of us, it's all or nothing.

00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.686
This game will only end
when one of us is six feet under.

00:21:10.769 --> 00:21:11.979
Release Soo-hyun.

00:21:12.688 --> 00:21:15.023
Then we settle this
until one of us wins.

00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:16.817
What a load of bullshit.

00:21:23.282 --> 00:21:24.992
There's no need to pull out knives.

00:21:25.242 --> 00:21:26.243
Isn't it embarrassing?

00:21:32.165 --> 00:21:33.709
- Hey!
- What the heck?

00:21:46.430 --> 00:21:48.807
Darn, that stings.

00:21:55.897 --> 00:21:57.441
Take this!

00:22:05.574 --> 00:22:06.867
You punk!

00:22:10.370 --> 00:22:11.371
You bastard.

00:22:18.795 --> 00:22:19.796
Darn it.

00:22:20.255 --> 00:22:22.549
- You punk.
- Even in this industry

00:22:22.924 --> 00:22:24.509
there's such a thing as ethics.

00:22:24.801 --> 00:22:26.762
Man, that bastard.

00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:28.388
Come on, J.

00:22:28.472 --> 00:22:29.598
It is nice to meet you.

00:22:29.681 --> 00:22:30.932
Muscles?

00:22:31.516 --> 00:22:32.726
Do you work out?

00:22:36.063 --> 00:22:39.107
J, how can you call a man "Muscles"?

00:22:39.191 --> 00:22:41.902
Darn it. All right.

00:22:42.402 --> 00:22:44.446
Let's see.

00:22:44.529 --> 00:22:45.864
Here it comes.

00:22:51.119 --> 00:22:52.120
Stop!

00:22:54.289 --> 00:22:55.374
Tell him to stop!

00:22:56.166 --> 00:22:57.417
Let go of me, bitch.

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:01.254
One more time.

00:23:01.338 --> 00:23:04.800
I'll do anything.
Just tell him to stop, please.

00:23:04.883 --> 00:23:05.884
You bitch.

00:23:11.598 --> 00:23:12.599
Joong-ki.

00:23:13.266 --> 00:23:15.018
You'll hurt your hands. Stop that.

00:23:17.437 --> 00:23:18.438
Darn it.

00:23:22.317 --> 00:23:23.735
Hey, Muscles.

00:23:24.528 --> 00:23:25.529
Hey, man.

00:23:26.113 --> 00:23:27.280
So you aren't a beginner lifter.

00:23:29.950 --> 00:23:31.410
You need to stop.

00:23:36.873 --> 00:23:39.709
Liars always get the biggest share.

00:23:43.004 --> 00:23:45.132
Man, that son of a bitch.

00:23:45.841 --> 00:23:46.842
Darn it.

00:23:51.263 --> 00:23:52.389
Step aside.

00:23:55.183 --> 00:23:56.393
Take your 500 billion and get lost.

00:23:56.476 --> 00:23:59.146
Stop bothering me and get lost,
you bitch!

00:24:01.773 --> 00:24:02.774
You little...

00:24:08.697 --> 00:24:09.698
Hey!

00:24:10.866 --> 00:24:11.867
Soo-hyun.

00:24:20.333 --> 00:24:23.420
Do you know why I went to Mujoo Dock
instead of coming straight here?

00:24:23.503 --> 00:24:25.714
I never forget punks who get smart

00:24:26.214 --> 00:24:27.632
or cheeky with me.

00:24:27.716 --> 00:24:30.927
I never spare punks like that.

00:24:31.011 --> 00:24:32.429
Hey, bring me a box cutter.

00:24:32.512 --> 00:24:33.930
I'll tear him apart.

00:24:34.014 --> 00:24:35.515
Hey, J!

00:24:35.974 --> 00:24:36.975
You idiot.

00:24:37.058 --> 00:24:40.562
Did you think 500 billion was yours?

00:24:40.645 --> 00:24:43.940
Nothing is yours forever
in this jungle, you idiot!

00:24:44.024 --> 00:24:46.860
Whoever takes it first gets it,
you son of a bitch!

00:24:47.277 --> 00:24:49.112
This is exactly why

00:24:49.529 --> 00:24:52.157
you're a cocksucker, idiot.

00:24:53.033 --> 00:24:55.076
Boss, are you all right?

00:24:55.577 --> 00:24:57.204
Let go of me, you punk!

00:25:02.626 --> 00:25:03.793
Jeez.

00:25:04.336 --> 00:25:07.214
Jungle, my ass.

00:25:07.297 --> 00:25:08.340
You bastard.

00:25:09.132 --> 00:25:10.550
Wildness?

00:25:11.218 --> 00:25:12.636
Is this the animal kingdom?

00:25:13.428 --> 00:25:14.846
Fuck this.

00:25:16.973 --> 00:25:18.975
Let's see who loses flesh first.

00:25:19.976 --> 00:25:21.311
Let's do this.

00:25:21.394 --> 00:25:23.063
You son of a bitch.

00:25:23.146 --> 00:25:24.856
Have you lost your mind, bastard?

00:25:38.286 --> 00:25:40.705
Muscles, it's kind of hot.

00:25:40.789 --> 00:25:41.790
Damn it.

00:25:44.209 --> 00:25:45.961
My ears nearly exploded.

00:25:49.631 --> 00:25:51.258
I'm fucked.

00:25:53.301 --> 00:25:54.386
Are the villains

00:25:54.886 --> 00:25:57.681
fighting over who's worse?

00:25:58.265 --> 00:26:01.685
Don't move,
or I'll put a bullet in your head.

00:26:03.186 --> 00:26:05.105
Man, Cha Ki-tae.

00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:09.401
I expected your ambition to get me.
What a surprise.

00:26:09.484 --> 00:26:11.278
Watching you two

00:26:11.361 --> 00:26:13.321
I suddenly came to my senses.

00:26:13.405 --> 00:26:16.199
I'm not a wild beast like you.

00:26:16.866 --> 00:26:18.618
- A wild beast?
- I'm sorry.

00:26:19.035 --> 00:26:21.663
Wild beasts must be caught and caged.

00:26:21.746 --> 00:26:22.747
All right.

00:26:25.166 --> 00:26:26.793
My dear police family.

00:26:27.168 --> 00:26:30.088
Do you know
what annoys you the most on duty?

00:26:31.756 --> 00:26:33.466
It's when you take a midday nap

00:26:33.717 --> 00:26:37.637
and a fly keeps buzzing
around your head.

00:26:39.598 --> 00:26:42.475
All of you are the same as ever

00:26:42.976 --> 00:26:45.770
annoying as fuck, bastards.

00:26:46.688 --> 00:26:49.316
- Drop the knife.
- Drop the guns, sons of bitches!

00:26:49.733 --> 00:26:50.942
Hey, Jang Joong-hyuk!

00:26:51.401 --> 00:26:53.278
You already know what I'm like.

00:26:57.574 --> 00:26:58.783
Five hundred billion won!

00:26:59.993 --> 00:27:02.746
You can have all 500 billion won

00:27:04.372 --> 00:27:05.373
so let Soo-hyun go.

00:27:05.957 --> 00:27:07.083
Son of a bitch.

00:27:08.543 --> 00:27:09.544
Hey.

00:27:10.253 --> 00:27:11.671
It's 500 billion.

00:27:12.672 --> 00:27:13.673
Five hundred billion won.

00:27:16.384 --> 00:27:17.636
Soo-hyun.

00:27:41.159 --> 00:27:42.869
JANG HYUK-JIN

00:28:08.978 --> 00:28:09.979
Son of a bitch.

00:28:18.738 --> 00:28:20.198
Think wisely.

00:28:21.449 --> 00:28:23.618
It's 500 billion.

00:28:24.202 --> 00:28:26.538
You can take all 500 billion won.

00:28:30.875 --> 00:28:31.918
What the heck are you doing?

00:28:32.585 --> 00:28:33.920
Let Soo-hyun go

00:28:35.088 --> 00:28:36.381
and get lost.

00:28:36.965 --> 00:28:40.218
Take the damn 500 billion
and get lost, bastard!

00:28:40.301 --> 00:28:41.553
Jang Joong-hyuk!

00:28:45.724 --> 00:28:47.016
Hey, run after him!

00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:50.061
Move aside.

00:28:50.145 --> 00:28:51.855
Shut your mouth and don't move.

00:28:52.981 --> 00:28:54.899
Damn it.

00:28:55.608 --> 00:28:57.610
Revenge is good for your health.

00:29:07.287 --> 00:29:09.372
Do not follow me.

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:23.678
Don't try to get smart with me.

00:29:25.096 --> 00:29:26.097
Stop.

00:29:38.568 --> 00:29:40.403
I'll chase after them,
so handle everyone here.

00:29:40.487 --> 00:29:41.488
Yes, sir!

00:29:55.877 --> 00:29:57.295
Man, these punks.

00:29:59.047 --> 00:30:00.048
You little...

00:30:02.342 --> 00:30:03.343
Hold still.

00:30:07.096 --> 00:30:08.097
Fuck.

00:30:26.407 --> 00:30:28.117
I'm fine.

00:31:02.318 --> 00:31:05.154
That bastard, J.

00:31:05.238 --> 00:31:06.447
All right.

00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:08.992
Just you wait.

00:31:24.591 --> 00:31:26.217
Old memories

00:31:28.094 --> 00:31:29.095
came back to me.

00:31:29.512 --> 00:31:30.513
What took you so long?

00:31:33.975 --> 00:31:36.477
With the misunderstanding resolved

00:31:36.978 --> 00:31:39.314
I can finally sleep easy.

00:31:41.691 --> 00:31:42.692
Will you

00:31:44.193 --> 00:31:45.653
disappear again?

00:31:45.945 --> 00:31:47.363
That's nonsense.

00:31:48.907 --> 00:31:50.742
You only disappear
if you're gone forever.

00:32:01.878 --> 00:32:03.713
He has such awful timing.

00:32:09.928 --> 00:32:10.929
Stop it.

00:32:25.193 --> 00:32:26.527
It was our misunderstanding.

00:32:26.611 --> 00:32:29.948
The warehouse explosion
from five years ago wasn't done by J.

00:32:44.379 --> 00:32:45.380
Bang.

00:32:52.261 --> 00:32:55.098
Who is this supernote game for?

00:32:56.474 --> 00:32:57.850
Were you seeking revenge

00:32:57.934 --> 00:33:01.104
because he damaged your pride
for losing your perfect record?

00:33:01.187 --> 00:33:02.814
Or is it revenge for Soo-hyun?

00:33:06.567 --> 00:33:08.403
It's not over yet.

00:33:08.945 --> 00:33:09.946
Our revenge, that is.

00:33:10.655 --> 00:33:11.656
"Our"?

00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:22.792
We three were after the same thing.

00:33:24.836 --> 00:33:27.672
Why did you give up Jang Joong-hyuk
and 500 billion won that easily?

00:33:28.047 --> 00:33:29.048
"Give up"?

00:33:31.009 --> 00:33:32.301
Did you just say I gave up?

00:33:43.730 --> 00:33:45.565
If you leave now,
when will you return?

00:33:49.902 --> 00:33:51.029
I haven't had...

00:33:53.573 --> 00:33:56.492
a chance to apologize or thank you.

00:33:58.327 --> 00:33:59.746
You wouldn't have gone through

00:34:01.122 --> 00:34:02.457
everything that you went through...

00:34:04.333 --> 00:34:06.377
if it hadn't been for me.

00:34:06.461 --> 00:34:08.463
It wasn't your fault.

00:34:09.881 --> 00:34:11.507
I'm a villain...

00:34:14.135 --> 00:34:16.637
so everyone in my life is a villain.

00:34:17.472 --> 00:34:19.098
If I stay with you...

00:34:21.184 --> 00:34:22.518
your life will be ruined too.

00:34:26.814 --> 00:34:29.734
It's a world where real becomes fake
and fake becomes real.

00:34:30.068 --> 00:34:31.319
This day and age is like that.

00:34:32.111 --> 00:34:33.946
Stay sharp about your life.

00:34:35.364 --> 00:34:36.783
Otherwise, I might come back.

00:34:44.082 --> 00:34:45.416
If I'm going to put on a show

00:34:46.584 --> 00:34:47.668
I better do it well.

00:35:24.747 --> 00:35:26.833
- What's this, Hyuk-jin?
- Give it to your dad.

00:35:27.083 --> 00:35:28.084
What is it?

00:35:28.334 --> 00:35:30.169
My dad took your dad's money and ran.

00:35:30.461 --> 00:35:32.672
It's only half of what he took,
but it should be enough

00:35:33.005 --> 00:35:34.507
to cover your dad's surgery fees.

00:35:39.220 --> 00:35:40.221
Hyuk-jin!

00:35:40.805 --> 00:35:42.223
If you leave now,
when will you return?

00:35:46.853 --> 00:35:48.062
In two to three days.

00:36:00.575 --> 00:36:03.369
He swindled over eight million won.

00:36:03.619 --> 00:36:05.163
He hasn't returned for a week.

00:36:05.246 --> 00:36:07.665
That means he ran far away,
just like his father did.

00:36:07.999 --> 00:36:10.251
- Like father, like son.
- No wonder.

00:36:10.334 --> 00:36:12.170
What do you want to be
when you grow up?

00:36:12.253 --> 00:36:13.337
A con artist.

00:36:13.588 --> 00:36:15.423
But they are bad people.

00:36:15.965 --> 00:36:17.717
If you become the best con artist

00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:20.219
you can live a fake life
as if it were real.

00:36:31.063 --> 00:36:32.773
JANG JOONG-HYUK'S LOCATION

00:37:03.763 --> 00:37:05.014
Jang Joong-hyuk.

00:37:05.097 --> 00:37:06.307
Everything is over.

00:37:23.157 --> 00:37:24.158
How did you know...

00:37:24.242 --> 00:37:26.452
How did I know you were here?

00:37:41.175 --> 00:37:42.176
Jeez.

00:37:42.593 --> 00:37:44.845
I have to pee really badly.

00:37:44.929 --> 00:37:47.014
Please excuse me.
I have to take a leak too.

00:37:48.349 --> 00:37:50.017
- Let them go.
- Sorry?

00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:53.104
The director was blackmailed again
and told us to let them go.

00:37:53.813 --> 00:37:54.814
You two.

00:37:55.064 --> 00:37:56.607
Listen carefully to my words.

00:37:56.691 --> 00:37:58.067
You two need to meet

00:37:58.150 --> 00:38:01.112
with the customs officer
Jang Joong-hyuk has bribed.

00:38:01.195 --> 00:38:04.824
And offer more money
than what he gave

00:38:05.408 --> 00:38:06.909
to win over

00:38:08.452 --> 00:38:09.453
the customs officers.

00:38:23.509 --> 00:38:24.802
I'm getting sick of this.

00:38:25.177 --> 00:38:26.178
Let's just go now.

00:38:26.262 --> 00:38:27.638
The moment I open my mouth

00:38:27.722 --> 00:38:32.226
many powerful figures
in politics and business

00:38:32.310 --> 00:38:33.769
will go down.

00:38:34.270 --> 00:38:36.897
- And?
- In this state

00:38:37.231 --> 00:38:39.650
do you really think
I won't use any means necessary?

00:38:40.609 --> 00:38:41.610
You know what?

00:38:42.570 --> 00:38:45.072
You've done too much evil
for it all to just disappear.

00:38:47.241 --> 00:38:50.161
Those at the top

00:38:51.287 --> 00:38:52.496
who've done worse than me

00:38:52.955 --> 00:38:54.373
are bound to cover up my crimes.

00:38:54.457 --> 00:38:56.792
Don't die too soon in prison.

00:38:57.543 --> 00:39:00.296
You must serve
your precious sentence until the end.

00:39:00.629 --> 00:39:02.465
- Take him away.
- Yes, sir.

00:39:05.593 --> 00:39:06.635
Cuff him.

00:39:08.721 --> 00:39:10.097
Take the evidence, bastard.

00:39:10.181 --> 00:39:11.182
Take it.

00:39:12.850 --> 00:39:14.352
Let go of me, you punk.

00:39:24.612 --> 00:39:26.364
What a load of bullshit.

00:39:32.787 --> 00:39:33.788
Go.

00:39:49.678 --> 00:39:51.305
The chief of a VCU
at Seoul Police Agency

00:39:51.389 --> 00:39:54.308
have been publicly listed as
a suspect in two firearm homicides

00:39:54.392 --> 00:39:56.352
sending shockwaves through society.

00:40:01.524 --> 00:40:06.821
A, E, I, O, U.

00:40:06.904 --> 00:40:07.905
Perfect timing.

00:40:08.989 --> 00:40:10.074
What's with the long face?

00:40:12.868 --> 00:40:15.371
Is it because I'm doing
your nationwide briefing?

00:40:16.205 --> 00:40:18.290
Isn't it a given?
I'm the team leader.

00:40:21.669 --> 00:40:22.670
Here.

00:40:22.753 --> 00:40:23.838
RESIGNATION LETTER

00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:26.173
- What's this?
- I don't want to see the director

00:40:26.632 --> 00:40:28.426
so relay that to him for me.

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:31.595
You solved a huge case.

00:40:31.679 --> 00:40:33.556
The five-year-old misunderstanding
was cleared up

00:40:34.056 --> 00:40:37.101
and you wouldn't have to roam around
in Myeong-dong anymore.

00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:39.228
Should I really give it to him?

00:40:39.311 --> 00:40:41.522
Okay, I get it.

00:40:41.981 --> 00:40:44.191
I'll go ask him for your position.

00:40:44.275 --> 00:40:46.110
- Give that to me.
- Come on.

00:40:46.193 --> 00:40:47.778
You already made your decision

00:40:47.862 --> 00:40:50.489
so I should respect that
out of courtesy, shouldn't I?

00:40:53.576 --> 00:40:55.911
Good grief, idiot.

00:40:55.995 --> 00:40:57.037
Bye, then.

00:40:58.956 --> 00:40:59.957
Wait.

00:41:00.458 --> 00:41:02.376
The director had been worried.

00:41:02.751 --> 00:41:05.588
You never found
the flash drive, right?

00:41:07.423 --> 00:41:08.591
Why do you ask?

00:41:10.009 --> 00:41:11.010
Well...

00:41:12.761 --> 00:41:15.598
I got intel that you and Han Soo-hyun
are working hand-in-hand.

00:41:21.312 --> 00:41:24.106
Why would I hold her hand?

00:41:24.190 --> 00:41:25.816
I have something called taste.

00:41:28.110 --> 00:41:30.905
Is the director freaking out
that I might expose the file?

00:41:31.655 --> 00:41:33.574
Yes, I think that's the case.

00:41:38.537 --> 00:41:39.538
Hey.

00:41:40.247 --> 00:41:42.041
Do I seem that righteous?

00:41:44.126 --> 00:41:45.920
That's true. No, right?

00:41:46.629 --> 00:41:48.631
Then I'll tell him
that you don't have it.

00:41:50.841 --> 00:41:51.842
Bye.

00:41:53.636 --> 00:41:54.637
Ki-tae!

00:41:55.262 --> 00:41:57.681
Think of your wife and kids, okay?

00:41:58.682 --> 00:42:02.102
I need to marry first
to have a wife and kids, you lunatic.

00:42:15.908 --> 00:42:18.536
I'm leaving a message
because you seem to be on air.

00:42:19.745 --> 00:42:21.956
Have you looked through
the files I've given you?

00:42:31.382 --> 00:42:33.217
I want to go back to those days.

00:42:38.347 --> 00:42:40.349
It's about time
we moved on from this.

00:42:41.016 --> 00:42:42.017
That way

00:42:43.060 --> 00:42:44.270
Mr. Yang

00:42:44.895 --> 00:42:46.814
will finally rest in peace.

00:42:56.156 --> 00:42:58.784
THE LATE YANG CHEOL-JIN

00:43:05.165 --> 00:43:07.459
What's real becomes fake

00:43:07.543 --> 00:43:09.336
and what's fake becomes real?

00:43:10.296 --> 00:43:11.297
What?

00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:12.881
It's something J said.

00:43:13.299 --> 00:43:14.925
He said in this world

00:43:15.384 --> 00:43:17.595
what's real becomes fake,
and what's fake becomes real.

00:43:19.722 --> 00:43:21.473
It must've been one of his wordplays.

00:43:21.557 --> 00:43:23.058
He loved doing that.

00:43:26.103 --> 00:43:27.104
No.

00:43:28.564 --> 00:43:30.065
His face seemed different

00:43:30.524 --> 00:43:31.817
when he said that.

00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:33.027
How can I put this?

00:43:34.111 --> 00:43:35.654
It was as if
he was sending a message.

00:43:38.907 --> 00:43:39.908
Could it be...

00:43:50.711 --> 00:43:53.213
HAN SOO-HYUN

00:43:58.510 --> 00:44:00.929
What's up? Did you want an update?

00:44:01.764 --> 00:44:02.890
I handed over the flash drive.

00:44:02.973 --> 00:44:04.558
It's not that.

00:44:04.642 --> 00:44:06.977
J's words have been on my mind.

00:44:07.061 --> 00:44:09.813
Have you made a request
to authenticate the 500 billion won

00:44:10.481 --> 00:44:12.816
confiscated at Incheon Port
container terminal?

00:44:12.900 --> 00:44:15.152
Why would I make a request
to authenticate real money?

00:44:15.235 --> 00:44:17.404
I had them run a few tests
on the counterfeit notes

00:44:17.488 --> 00:44:19.031
sent to KC Bank's new headquarters.

00:44:19.114 --> 00:44:21.241
It's been ten days since the request,
so it should be done soon.

00:44:21.492 --> 00:44:23.827
You can come along if you're curious.
After all, you made it.

00:44:33.212 --> 00:44:34.338
There you are.

00:44:35.172 --> 00:44:36.173
Hey.

00:44:50.688 --> 00:44:51.689
What's the result?

00:44:59.905 --> 00:45:01.448
You seem better than I expected.

00:45:01.532 --> 00:45:03.534
I just need to rot in here
for three years

00:45:04.410 --> 00:45:05.911
so why would I be bitter?

00:45:05.994 --> 00:45:08.080
Your release is much earlier
than I thought.

00:45:08.163 --> 00:45:11.959
The firearm case got dismissed
for lack of evidence.

00:45:13.460 --> 00:45:17.089
All of Eul Society is keeping quiet,
watching my every move.

00:45:17.756 --> 00:45:18.757
So

00:45:20.217 --> 00:45:23.345
all I got was three years
as a first-time offender for theft.

00:45:24.888 --> 00:45:27.725
Make sure you stay healthy, okay?

00:45:28.475 --> 00:45:30.602
I'll repay my debt once I get out.

00:45:35.774 --> 00:45:37.067
Unfortunately, I have bad news.

00:45:38.402 --> 00:45:39.611
I have a feeling

00:45:40.696 --> 00:45:43.031
you'll rot in there
for at least 20 more years.

00:45:45.200 --> 00:45:47.703
The money you went after

00:45:48.036 --> 00:45:51.248
even at the risk of your life...

00:45:51.331 --> 00:45:52.624
The counterfeits that were swapped

00:45:52.958 --> 00:45:54.877
with real notes
and sent to KC Bank...

00:45:57.087 --> 00:45:58.505
...were supernotes.

00:46:00.507 --> 00:46:01.508
...were authentic.

00:46:11.059 --> 00:46:12.060
Boss.

00:46:12.394 --> 00:46:15.147
Why are we swapping
real money with fake ones

00:46:15.230 --> 00:46:17.858
and fakes with real notes again?

00:46:19.777 --> 00:46:21.987
Once Yeon finds out,
Soo-hyun will find out too.

00:46:22.529 --> 00:46:24.740
Then Cha Ki-tae of NIS
will find out as well.

00:46:26.533 --> 00:46:27.659
The key to this plan

00:46:28.786 --> 00:46:31.413
is to deceive everyone

00:46:32.039 --> 00:46:33.957
I invited five years ago.

00:46:38.545 --> 00:46:40.964
I thought we were almost done.
Why does it feel like it never ends?

00:46:41.673 --> 00:46:44.885
I have no idea
what's real and what's fake anymore.

00:46:45.385 --> 00:46:46.720
Shut your mouth.

00:46:46.804 --> 00:46:48.555
We have a long way to go
to meet the D-day.

00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:49.640
Hurry up.

00:46:54.978 --> 00:46:55.979
How much is left?

00:46:56.063 --> 00:46:59.274
We still have
about 25 billion won down there.

00:46:59.817 --> 00:47:02.319
We've been doing this
every night for a week

00:47:02.402 --> 00:47:03.445
and we're not done yet.

00:47:04.238 --> 00:47:05.781
I can't believe
we're doing this on the day of.

00:47:07.199 --> 00:47:09.201
- Is this the last batch?
- Yes, it's the last one.

00:47:09.284 --> 00:47:10.285
Okay, let's go.

00:47:16.041 --> 00:47:17.709
Do you expect me to believe you?

00:47:26.426 --> 00:47:29.555
I finally understand the real ending
to the supernote game

00:47:29.638 --> 00:47:30.848
just as J wanted.

00:47:32.641 --> 00:47:34.560
I made sure you got caught

00:47:34.643 --> 00:47:37.771
circulating a huge amount,
a total of 500 billion won.

00:47:37.855 --> 00:47:39.982
To make matters worse,
they were realistic fake bills.

00:47:40.065 --> 00:47:41.984
It was to make sure
he serves over 20 years in prison.

00:47:42.067 --> 00:47:45.445
Because you were the real culprit
who caused Yang Dosa's death.

00:47:45.529 --> 00:47:46.864
Because I wanted revenge.

00:47:48.824 --> 00:47:50.325
J reached that final goal

00:47:52.244 --> 00:47:53.871
in my place.

00:48:12.639 --> 00:48:16.059
Why are you playing
this reckless game

00:48:17.269 --> 00:48:18.854
when you gain nothing from it?

00:48:22.608 --> 00:48:24.610
Even if I told you,
you wouldn't understand.

00:48:26.111 --> 00:48:27.321
You're that slow.

00:48:31.658 --> 00:48:32.868
Hey!

00:48:40.334 --> 00:48:43.921
CITIZEN SERVICE CENTER

00:49:02.522 --> 00:49:04.524
I hacked the server
that stores private keys.

00:49:06.652 --> 00:49:07.653
Yes?

00:49:12.324 --> 00:49:13.325
Leave it.

00:49:15.577 --> 00:49:16.578
Just leave it.

00:49:35.389 --> 00:49:36.390
Let's eat tteokbokki.

00:49:36.473 --> 00:49:37.516
- Tteokbokki.
- What?

00:49:38.183 --> 00:49:39.685
We already bought enough food.

00:49:45.691 --> 00:49:46.858
Thank you.

00:49:46.942 --> 00:49:49.236

MYEONGSEONG GROUP, CHAIRMAN BANG
SLUSH FUND ACCOUNT UNCOVERED

00:50:28.442 --> 00:50:30.068
How long has he been meditating?

00:50:30.777 --> 00:50:31.987
He must be atoning for his sins.

He's confirmed to serve 25 years

00:50:34.573 --> 00:50:36.324

to prison by tomorrow.
