WEBVTT

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:05.480
That jerk. I swear I'll hunt him down
and make him pay.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.610
And if I don't find him,
I won't be Oh Jang Mi.

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:12.150
Gosh, seriously.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:16.650
Excuse me, can I ask you a question?

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:18.190
By any chance,

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:24.530
do you remember the man
who bought this lingerie yesterday?

00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.730
May I ask why?

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.600
Our shopping bags got switched yesterday.

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.240
I need to get the gift
I bought for my mom back,

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:38.240
but I have no way of contacting him
to switch them back.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:39.480
I see.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:41.450
Really?

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:46.180
Could I get the phone number
for his rewards account?

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:48.220
I'm afraid I can't do that.
It's personal information.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:53.430
Right. Of course it is.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.190
Okay, then.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.500
Gosh, what a mess.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.740
Goodness, I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.010
You're that brat from yesterday?

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.710
"A brat?"

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:18.120
Did you just call me a brat?

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:21.050
- Unbelievable.
- Look who's talking!

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.820
You're the one going around
being a pervert!

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.090
Gosh, my ears. You don't have to shout.
Is anyone here deaf?

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:28.160
Keep your voice down.

00:01:28.190 --> 00:01:31.660
Why on earth are you carrying around
something so disgusting?

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.730
You probably switched the bags on purpose
to mess with me.

00:01:35.070 --> 00:01:39.270
I'm not even fazed by things like this,
you pervert!

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:41.140
Gosh, I can't believe this woman.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.010
A pervert? How dare you?

00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.510
Besides, why would I do that on purpose
for you to see?

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:51.280
Stop letting your imagination run wild.

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:54.690
- You're really jumping to conclusions.
- Then you didn't do it on purpose?

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:57.790
Then what was your motive
for deliberately swapping bags with me?

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:59.820
- "Motive?"
- You!

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:02.730
You were eyeing me
when I was buying lingerie for my mom.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.760
Weren't you deliberately targeting
the women's lingerie?

00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:05.960
What? Deliberately?

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.900
That's why you deliberately started
that whole "I got the cab first" thing,

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:11.170
just to get me to share the cab with you.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.370
I see it now.
Your goal was the lingerie all along.

00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:17.840
I can't believe what I'm hearing.

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.680
How dare you label me like that?
Listen here!

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:23.850
What would I even do
with women's lingerie?

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.820
What would you do?
You probably have some kind of fetish.

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:27.950
Or you wear it yourself.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.290
That's it! I've been patient,
but now you're crossing a line.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.290
Do you think it's okay to cross the line
and make me sound like a pervert?

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.190
Who do you think crossed the line first?

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:39.060
Gosh, just give me back the lingerie
I bought.

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:42.300
If you didn't take it on purpose,
then give it back!

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.070
Excuse me. Please don't cause a scene.
Take this outside.

00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:50.070
- Sorry. She's being ridiculous.
- I apologize.

00:02:50.810 --> 00:02:52.010
Follow me outside.

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:57.620
Come on!

00:02:58.750 --> 00:02:59.750
I'm coming!

00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:06.020
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.610
Hey, President Hwang.

00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:25.010
I'd like to see talent from your agency
for our new Dream Group model.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:26.410
When are you free?

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:28.850
You are?

00:03:29.580 --> 00:03:32.980
All right. Then I'll come by your office.

00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:34.520
Okay.

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.660
Ma'am.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.600
Kang Jun Ho, the new head chef
for Chang Restaurant,

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.460
is here to see you.

00:03:46.630 --> 00:03:47.630
Send him in.

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.680
It's a pleasure to meet you.

00:03:58.380 --> 00:03:59.380
My name is Kang Jun Ho.

00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:01.150
Have a seat.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:09.120
That will be all, Assistant Manager Jin.

00:04:10.150 --> 00:04:11.160
Yes, ma'am.

00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:19.860
You and Assistant Manager Jin
were classmates...

00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.670
- at a culinary school in the US.
- Yes.

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:24.800
Your resume says you won first place
in an American cooking competition...

00:04:24.970 --> 00:04:27.610
and worked at a Michelin-star restaurant.
It's quite an impressive background.

00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:29.340
So why come back to Korea?

00:04:29.910 --> 00:04:31.440
I moved to the US when I was 20,

00:04:31.980 --> 00:04:34.050
and after working abroad for so long,

00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:37.980
I felt it was time to come back to Korea,
where my parents live.

00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.620
More than anything,

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.620
I've always dreamed of
combining Western and Korean cuisine...

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:45.220
to pioneer my own unique culinary style.

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.720
So then,

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:51.060
at our hotel's newly renovated
Chang Restaurant,

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.500
- you'll be doing your experiment?
- I wouldn't call it an experiment.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.140
Cooking is a creative art.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:05:00.240
I received offers from many other places,

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.270
but the reason I specifically chose
Chang Restaurant...

00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:04.780
Is it because of
Assistant Manager Jin Hong Ju?

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.780
Hong Ju?

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:08.310
What makes you say that?

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:11.780
Hong Ju and I were just classmates.
That's all.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:13.250
Regardless,

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:17.320
Assistant Manager Jin was so instrumental
in recruiting you,

00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:20.260
so I just assumed that connection
is what brought you to us.

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:24.530
It's because Chang Restaurant
is the absolute worst.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.200
Excuse me?

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:28.530
The other restaurants
that made me offers...

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:31.270
were all doing fine without me.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.310
But Chang Restaurant at Dream Hotel...

00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:38.480
was a complete disaster, top to bottom.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.840
A disaster?

00:05:40.650 --> 00:05:42.480
Where does he get off being so cocky?

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:46.380
It doesn't matter
if you renovate Chang Restaurant or what.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:50.620
I realized it would be nearly impossible
to save this place without me.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.320
That's why I accepted your offer.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:56.830
Fine.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:05:59.430
If that's how you feel, then we'll see.

00:06:00.100 --> 00:06:03.230
We'll see if you can actually deliver
on all that big talk,

00:06:03.430 --> 00:06:05.270
or if you're just full of hot air.

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:07.870
Very well.

00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:09.640
You just wait and see.

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:15.380
Here.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:18.950
Take your pervy stuff back,
and give me back what I got for my mom.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:20.590
What am I going to do?

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:22.920
My mom already wore it.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.290
What is it?

00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:27.790
- Did you wear it already?
- Hey, come on.

00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:30.290
Then why are you standing there speechless
when I ask for it back?

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:33.130
Gosh, you're so loud.
Will you stop nagging?

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.700
Why are you trying to change the subject?

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.300
Right.

00:06:36.870 --> 00:06:38.700
Just give me back
what I bought for my mom.

00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.240
I don't want to waste another breath
on you.

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.510
How much did it cost?

00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:46.080
I'll just pay you for it.

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:48.150
What? You're not serious.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.820
- So it's true!
- Hey!

00:06:50.880 --> 00:06:54.220
Of course it is. If you didn't wear it,
why can't you give it back?

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:58.360
Look, do I have to explain myself to you?
I said I'd pay you for it.

00:06:58.520 --> 00:07:00.760
- How much was it?
- You think money solves everything?

00:07:01.330 --> 00:07:04.960
- You should apologize first.
- Why should I apologize?

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:06.430
Did I steal it or something?

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:09.270
You're the one who took my bag
and got off first!

00:07:09.530 --> 00:07:12.440
Let's get our facts straight.
I hailed that cab,

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:14.510
so who was it
that just had to shove their way inside?

00:07:14.570 --> 00:07:17.510
And who's the one who got out
with my shopping bag?

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:22.010
I'm sure you, Mr. Rude Pervert,
switched the bags to give me yours.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:25.420
Whatever. So you're saying
you won't apologize?

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:27.490
I'd have to be in the wrong to apologize.

00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:31.690
Anyway, I'll pay you for your stuff.
How much was it?

00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:35.260
You're so eager
to flash your money around.

00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:38.560
Just give me my mom's gift back.

00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:41.270
Bring back her present, exactly as it was.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:43.100
Bring it back,
and then I'll return this to you.

00:07:44.300 --> 00:07:46.740
Bring that back.
Do you have any idea how much it's worth?

00:07:46.840 --> 00:07:47.840
Bring it back right now.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:50.710
- We're making a trade.
- Are you insane?

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:54.150
You think the guitar's in the same league
as some cheap lingerie?

00:07:54.210 --> 00:07:56.450
Whatever. Just cut the chatter.

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:58.350
You bring me my mom's gift,

00:07:58.850 --> 00:08:00.120
and I'll give this back to you.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:04.860
Just put your number in.

00:08:12.700 --> 00:08:13.700
"Just wait and see?"

00:08:14.930 --> 00:08:17.940
Fine. After all that big talk,

00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:19.440
we'll just have to see about that.

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:24.440
If you double Chang Restaurant's sales,
I'll admit you've earned your big talk.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:26.580
I'll give you two months.

00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.780
But if you fail to double the sales
after two months,

00:08:30.150 --> 00:08:31.550
you will resign, no questions asked.

00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:34.090
I’m fine with that.

00:08:35.590 --> 00:08:39.420
You seem awfully confident
just because our hotel scouted you,

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.190
but there are many other chefs,
not just you.

00:08:43.130 --> 00:08:44.160
I'm sure there are.

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:49.200
If you're so displeased with me,
why did you bother to recruit me?

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.200
Mom!

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:54.470
I'm speaking with a guest.
Don't just barge in.

00:08:55.110 --> 00:08:57.440
A guest of yours
is a guest of mine, you know.

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:03.380
- Who's this?
- Say hello. I was about to introduce you.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:11.020
Gosh.

00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.990
For once, someone
can actually stand up to my mom.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:18.960
I'm Ma Seo Rin.

00:09:19.230 --> 00:09:21.100
Ma Seo Rin,
the Director of Food and Beverage.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:26.100
I was just hired at Chang Restaurant.
My name is Kang Jun Ho.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.610
You're the famous executive chef...

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.740
from the three-star Michelin place
in the US.

00:09:32.610 --> 00:09:33.980
It's nice to finally
put a face to the name.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:37.110
And you're handsome too.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:38.650
You're totally my type.

00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:39.980
Director Ma.

00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:42.650
If you'll excuse me.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:47.990
See you around.

00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:55.600
- Goodness. That guy has ice in his veins.
- That arrogant punk.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:58.670
Who does he think he is,
acting so high and mighty with me?

00:09:59.370 --> 00:10:00.370
Just you wait.

00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:03.470
Mom, don't turn this into
one of your strange competitions.

00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:07.480
How long are you going to act
like such a spoiled brat?

00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:10.250
This is a workplace.
What's with calling me "Mom?"

00:10:11.380 --> 00:10:14.350
What? So, now I can't even call
my own mother "Mom?"

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:16.320
Isn't it about time you learned
to stand on your own two feet?

00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:18.390
How long will you carry on like this?

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:20.860
How do you expect to take over
the Dream Group?

00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:25.560
Gosh, whatever! I can't hear you!

00:10:25.630 --> 00:10:26.860
- My gosh, this child...
- I can't hear you.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:29.570
Tae Pyung, the dishes are piling up.

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:32.600
Hush now, my little bunny.

00:10:33.370 --> 00:10:35.170
You're such a pretty bunny.

00:10:35.310 --> 00:10:39.210
That kid. The dishes are piling up.
Where did he run off to?

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.880
- Dad.
- You're home.

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.580
- I'll get them.
- Jang Mi! You're home!

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.250
Jang Mi, Tae Pyung brought
the bunny for me.

00:10:48.320 --> 00:10:50.050
So he bought it for your birthday?

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:51.760
Where did Tae Pyung go?

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:56.190
Off to sing, obviously.
He probably thought I'd stop him,

00:10:56.290 --> 00:10:58.260
so he just snuck out. Gosh.

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.070
I should've broken his legs...

00:11:01.130 --> 00:11:02.830
to keep him from leaving.

00:11:02.970 --> 00:11:06.600
Dad, you know he'd go sing
even if he were on crutches.

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.010
I'll get the dishes done in a jiffy.

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.640
Mom, don't open this.

00:11:11.640 --> 00:11:13.680
Just play with the bunny for now, okay?

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:24.090
(Kim Do Yi)

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:33.760
Seeing you sitting here like this...

00:11:33.760 --> 00:11:37.200
reminds me of
when you were a huge TV star.

00:11:38.040 --> 00:11:40.300
You look exactly the same
as you did 30 years ago.

00:11:40.970 --> 00:11:43.170
I mean, you look exactly the same, Ma'am.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.780
President Hwang, why the sudden formality?

00:11:48.250 --> 00:11:51.650
Just talk to me like you used to,
like an agency CEO to one of his stars.

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:55.190
But you're the daughter-in-law
of the Dream Group,

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:57.560
and now you're the CEO of the Dream Hotel.

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:02.530
No one here really catches my eye.
For the hotel's renewal,

00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:04.100
I need a fresh new face.

00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.570
President Hwang. It's been a while.
Oh Tae Pyung here.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:13.170
It's great to see you again.

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:17.680
- You have company. Should I return later?
- No, it's fine.

00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:21.080
Actually, I'm also looking for a singer
to perform at the lounge.

00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:25.280
Yes, hello.
I'm Oh Tae Pyung's legal advisor,

00:12:25.350 --> 00:12:26.520
Lawyer Kang Baek Ho.

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.760
Look at you, Oh Tae Pyung,
bringing your own lawyer.

00:12:31.820 --> 00:12:35.390
Okay, then. Please listen to my song.
Just pretend you're in the audience.

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:40.970
- All right.
- Thank you. Once you hear Tae Pyung sing,

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:43.600
you'll be dying to give him a record deal.

00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.280
Let's have a drink

00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:06.860
Tonight, you and I

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:09.690
We'll run as one

00:13:30.080 --> 00:13:31.150
Hello.

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.120
- Here's your side dish delivery.
- Thank you.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.150
Enjoy your meal.

00:13:36.290 --> 00:13:38.960
Hello. I have the side dishes you ordered.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:40.660
Enjoy.

00:13:50.300 --> 00:13:51.300
The side dishes...

00:13:56.240 --> 00:13:57.240
Oh, no.

00:13:58.380 --> 00:13:59.410
What do I do?

00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:03.650
- We'll become one and run
- That's enough.

00:14:03.780 --> 00:14:05.220
Okay, stop.

00:14:05.620 --> 00:14:08.290
- Sorry?
- That's not music. That's just noise.

00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.850
You heard her. Get lost, you punk.

00:14:10.850 --> 00:14:14.160
Noise? What are you talking about?
Come on, just give him one more chance.

00:14:14.330 --> 00:14:15.430
It's okay.

00:14:15.730 --> 00:14:18.500
I've been shot down so many times,
so I'm immune to it.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:21.400
But I'll be back, President Hwang.

00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:33.480
Hey, Jang Mi. What? Mom did?

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:36.510
If my dear Jung Suk Hee wants
a whipped cream cake,

00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:39.120
- then a whipped cream cake she'll have.
- Jung Suk Hee?

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.420
That name sounds so familiar.

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:50.260
That woman has no ear for music.
Noise? You sound like a songbird.

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:55.930
I'll just keep knocking on doors...

00:14:56.230 --> 00:14:58.600
- until they let me in.
- That's the spirit, Oh Tae Pyung.

00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.510
Hey, I even bought a guitar for you.
Just you wait.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.510
You'll sound even better
if you sing while playing.

00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:05.910
Kang Baek Ho.

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:08.180
I already owe you so much, and now this?

00:15:08.250 --> 00:15:09.550
Owe me? Don't be ridiculous.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:11.880
At least you know it.

00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:13.250
What was that?

00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:17.020
I mean, defending a scam victim for free
is not easy.

00:15:17.490 --> 00:15:19.620
Plus, for a lawyer, time is money.

00:15:19.620 --> 00:15:21.360
But you're worried I'll be scammed again,

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:23.930
so you tag along with me. Thanks, brother.

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:26.160
Stop being so cheesy.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.800
Hey, I do it because I want to,

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:30.070
so don't ever say that again.

00:15:30.370 --> 00:15:33.000
- Or else I'll get mad.
- Come here, give me a smooch.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.240
Hey, stop it! That's disgusting!

00:15:43.650 --> 00:15:46.280
Looks like our Seo Rin
is keeping Father happy.

00:15:51.320 --> 00:15:53.120
Debt of gratitude?
What are you talking about?

00:15:53.620 --> 00:15:56.360
Your kindness is as vast as a river.

00:15:56.690 --> 00:15:59.760
Thanks to you, Chairman,
we could afford Hong Ju's tuition,

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:02.600
and she was able to attend college.
And that's not all, is it?

00:16:02.830 --> 00:16:04.370
She even got a job at the hotel...

00:16:04.900 --> 00:16:06.240
and was sent abroad for training.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:11.080
I worry about
how we can ever repay you, Chairman.

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:15.380
Hong Ju will be the pigeon
that brings you good fortune,

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:17.080
so just you wait and see, Chairman.

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:21.090
- Mom, it's a swallow, not a pigeon.
- What?

00:16:22.350 --> 00:16:25.360
Pigeon, swallow, what's the difference?

00:16:30.860 --> 00:16:32.560
Yeom San Wol, what are you doing here?

00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:34.330
Oh, my, CEO Chae.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:36.800
You're home now?

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:40.270
- You must be tired.
- Assistant Manager Jin...

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:41.410
came by to say hello.

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:43.870
You should've told me you were coming.

00:16:44.210 --> 00:16:47.240
That way, I could have had the housekeeper
prepare a proper dinner for you.

00:16:47.310 --> 00:16:50.150
I'm sorry. It was a last-minute trip,

00:16:50.410 --> 00:16:52.320
so I didn't get a chance to inform you,
CEO Chae.

00:16:52.380 --> 00:16:56.290
I worried it would be rude to wait longer
to pay our respects to Chairman,

00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:58.020
so I was the one who insisted we come now.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:17:01.290
- That's why she came unannounced.
- That's not it.

00:17:01.830 --> 00:17:03.190
I told them to come.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.200
Pardon?

00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:08.100
Does she need your permission
just to come and say hello to me?

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:11.900
Don't make our guests uncomfortable.
What's wrong with you?

00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:17.570
By the way, what did you think
of Chef Kang Jun Ho from earlier?

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:19.640
Chef Kang Jun Ho?

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:21.710
Apparently, he's a very popular star chef.

00:17:21.710 --> 00:17:23.580
Our Hong Ju...

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:25.950
was instrumental in recruiting him.

00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:28.990
He's the talent who won first place
in an American cooking competition, right?

00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:32.360
Yes. King Restaurant
was trying to scout him,

00:17:32.460 --> 00:17:34.020
but I managed to snatch him up first.

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:38.160
I recommended him to CEO Chae
as head chef for Chang Restaurant.

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:41.970
That sneaky little fox.
She went over my head to talk to Father.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.640
Look at you.
You've really pulled something off.

00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.640
He's a talent
we just couldn't afford to lose.

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:51.940
He's not officially on board yet,
so let's not get ahead of ourselves.

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:55.210
We'll see how good he really is
over the next two months.

00:18:05.060 --> 00:18:08.530
- Get Seo Rin in here right now.
- What? Seo Rin?

00:18:09.090 --> 00:18:10.260
What has she done?

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.440
Did Seo Rin get into trouble again?

00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:26.310
She's been quiet for a while.
What did she do the minute she got back?

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.820
- Yes, CEO Chae.
- What have you been doing?

00:18:36.990 --> 00:18:38.060
Is something wrong?

00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:41.060
Get to the club, find Seo Rin,
and bring her here. Right now.

00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.230
- The club?
- Didn't I say to watch her social media?

00:18:44.730 --> 00:18:46.830
Why didn't you listen to me
and let this happen?

00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:49.770
Go drag her here this instant. Now!

00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:52.640
That little brat.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.270
She was quiet for a while,
but she's at it again.

00:19:02.010 --> 00:19:05.520
Suk Hee likes the cake.
Tae Pyung bought it.

00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.750
Suk Hee, do you like the cake that much?

00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:10.290
Cake is good.

00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:14.260
Bok Gil is good too. You have some too.

00:19:14.730 --> 00:19:16.460
Jang Mi, you eat up.

00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.600
- What about me?
- Hey, you.

00:19:20.600 --> 00:19:23.300
Mom, I'm the one who bought it,
and you're not going to offer me any?

00:19:24.200 --> 00:19:25.970
Tae Pyung, thank you.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:29.770
Seriously.
Why are you treating Mom like that?

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:32.180
Look at you. She's my mom too. So what?

00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:35.510
- Come here.
- Dad! Make him stop!

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:38.780
- The frosting is yummy. Don't fight.
- Bring it on.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:40.350
- Leave Jang Mi alone.
- That's enough.

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:42.350
- Go on, try me.
- Stop fooling around.

00:19:42.420 --> 00:19:44.860
- Go on.
- No, don't.

00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:45.920
Stop it.

00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:50.260
What? They expect you to double sales
in two months?

00:19:50.930 --> 00:19:53.900
- That's insane.
- What kind of restaurant does that?

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:56.900
The clientele for fine dining restaurants
is pretty fixed,

00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.300
so doubling sales that fast is impossible.

00:19:59.300 --> 00:20:00.600
Does the CEO of Dream Hotel...

00:20:00.670 --> 00:20:02.440
have it out for you or something?

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:06.240
Otherwise, how could anyone expect you
to double sales so suddenly?

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:09.410
- Don't worry about it.
- What? You think you can do it?

00:20:10.610 --> 00:20:12.280
That's my brother for you.

00:20:13.050 --> 00:20:15.020
That's right. He is my son, after all.

00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:17.720
- He's my son.
- Oh, please.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:20.990
By the way, honey, didn't you say...

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.960
you were working on a joint project
with Dream Hotel?

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:23.960
Yes.

00:20:24.060 --> 00:20:27.800
I think I might get a chance
to meet that CEO soon.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.700
I'm going to find out what her deal is.
The nerve of that lady.

00:20:30.770 --> 00:20:33.170
- How dare she treat my son like that?
- Please don't say anything.

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:35.970
I'll handle my own affairs.

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:47.580
- Just a second.
- My goodness. Look at you.

00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:50.190
Oh, Grandpa.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:52.420
- My grandpa!
- Goodness.

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:54.960
How much did you have to drink?

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:57.790
You're going to ruin your health.
You hear me?

00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.830
Just a little.
I was in such a good mood today.

00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.900
- So I had a few drinks.
- For goodness' sake.

00:21:06.070 --> 00:21:08.270
She said she was meeting some friends
she hadn't seen in a while.

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:10.770
Looks like she had a few drinks
with them, Father.

00:21:10.810 --> 00:21:14.080
- Get her upstairs so she can rest.
- Yes, Father.

00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:17.310
- Goodness. Good night.
- Good night.

00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:20.150
My stomach burns.

00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.160
You deleted that photo from her socials,
didn't you?

00:21:29.530 --> 00:21:31.460
- Yes, ma'am.
- You should've handled it...

00:21:31.460 --> 00:21:33.560
before the PR Team
or Secretary Kim found out.

00:21:34.430 --> 00:21:36.770
Make sure this doesn't happen again.
Keep a close eye on her.

00:21:37.430 --> 00:21:39.800
Most young people
are on social media these days.

00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:41.300
I'm not sure we need to be this strict...

00:21:41.370 --> 00:21:43.910
Do you think I'd be cracking down
if she used it properly?

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:46.840
But she only ever does things
that hurt our stock price.

00:21:48.710 --> 00:21:52.620
It's like Ma Seo Rin goes out of her way
just to mess with me.

00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:54.250
Just like you'd expect from her bloodline.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:56.020
CEO Chae.

00:21:58.060 --> 00:21:59.060
You may go.

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:01.930
I'll pay more attention from now on.

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:03.890
Please try not to be so upset.

00:22:10.930 --> 00:22:13.470
Should I have taken
the other twin back then?

00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:15.940
Why is she becoming such a handful?

00:22:16.740 --> 00:22:18.240
She was so obedient when she was little.

00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:36.760
Mom.

00:22:37.630 --> 00:22:38.660
I love you.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.260
My beautiful mom.

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:51.440
If my dear Jung Suk Hee wants
a whipped cream cake,

00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:53.310
then a whipped cream cake she'll have.

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.350
Jung Suk Hee.

00:22:56.580 --> 00:22:58.650
Why does that name sound so familiar?

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.120
Jung Suk Hee, where are you?

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.960
Jung Suk Hee, where are you?

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:09.230
Where are you? Where is Jung Suk Hee?

00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.200
What? Did she overhear everything?

00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:16.730
Is that why she caught on and ran away?
Jung Suk Hee!

00:23:17.430 --> 00:23:20.040
Consider today the day
you and your children die.

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:23.610
Where are you? Jung Suk Hee!

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:25.440
Jung Suk Hee!

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.240
Jung Suk Hee...

00:23:29.210 --> 00:23:31.380
How could I have forgotten that name?

00:23:31.950 --> 00:23:33.320
Even after all these years.

00:23:36.690 --> 00:23:39.220
- Let's go!
- Let go of me!

00:23:39.290 --> 00:23:44.060
- Take me to Jang Mi.
- Let go!

00:23:44.060 --> 00:23:46.700
- I said let go!
- Take me to Jang Mi.

00:23:46.700 --> 00:23:50.470
- Let's go!
- Let go of me!

00:23:57.040 --> 00:23:58.140
Jung Suk Hee.

00:23:59.140 --> 00:24:00.740
She looked like Jung Suk Hee.

00:24:01.650 --> 00:24:02.810
No.

00:24:03.610 --> 00:24:07.020
Jung Suk Hee died back then.
They told me she was dead for sure.

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.190
There's no way she's still alive.

00:24:10.290 --> 00:24:11.520
It must be someone else
with the same name.

00:24:25.800 --> 00:24:26.840
Is something the matter?

00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:32.380
Kang Hyuk.
You told me Jung Suk Hee was dead, right?

00:24:32.710 --> 00:24:34.340
Pardon? Jung Suk Hee?

00:24:36.310 --> 00:24:39.080
- Why bring her up all of a sudden?
- Just answer me. I'm asking you.

00:24:39.880 --> 00:24:43.190
You said she was dead.
Or rather, she is dead, right?

00:24:44.550 --> 00:24:45.890
She fell from so high up.

00:24:45.890 --> 00:24:47.920
- There's no way she could've survived.
- What about the body?

00:24:48.120 --> 00:24:49.590
But her body was never found.

00:24:49.590 --> 00:24:51.900
The fact that nothing's happened
all this time must mean she's dead.

00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:55.930
Otherwise, the police
would have come straight to you.

00:24:56.300 --> 00:24:57.730
Do you think she would've stayed quiet?

00:24:58.240 --> 00:24:59.570
Not after her child was taken from her.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:03.340
But what brought this on all of a sudden?

00:25:03.870 --> 00:25:04.880
Right.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.080
It must just be someone
with the same name.

00:25:07.880 --> 00:25:09.550
Jung Suk Hee is a pretty common name.

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:11.510
It's been so long.

00:25:12.120 --> 00:25:14.120
How would I even recognize her
after all this time?

00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:17.020
Did you happen to run into her?

00:25:17.350 --> 00:25:20.390
I feel uneasy.
I don't know why I feel so on edge.

00:25:21.290 --> 00:25:23.130
The fact that they never found a body
is unsettling,

00:25:23.530 --> 00:25:26.460
and hearing her exact name out of the blue
is unsettling too.

00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:29.870
Why did I have to see a woman
who looks like her? Just why?

00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:33.500
I can't let this go.

00:25:33.970 --> 00:25:35.970
I need to return to where I last saw her.

00:25:40.010 --> 00:25:41.080
CEO Chae.

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:43.350
What is it?

00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.320
The guy who was singing yesterday?

00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:48.390
You mean Oh Tae Pyung.

00:25:50.390 --> 00:25:52.220
Of course, I don't know where he lives.

00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:05.370
Yes, sir.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:08.470
What? You want me to come to the office?

00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:20.950
(Dream Group Negotiating
One Billion-dollar Investment...)

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:22.290
(with a Middle Eastern
Sovereign Wealth Fund)

00:26:23.750 --> 00:26:26.720
Thankfully, it seems Seo Rin's photo
was well blocked in the articles.

00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:28.930
Okay.

00:26:29.860 --> 00:26:30.890
Of course.

00:26:31.530 --> 00:26:32.560
Okay.

00:26:33.300 --> 00:26:35.570
Yes. Right. I get it.

00:26:36.570 --> 00:26:40.600
Mom, hang on. What? Bring my resume?

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.540
Okay. Got it.

00:26:58.390 --> 00:26:59.620
Jung Suk Hee?

00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:48.810
(The First Man)

00:27:48.810 --> 00:27:50.610
That was definitely Jung Suk Hee's face.

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:53.140
I have to make sure.

00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:55.910
Bring your family relation certificate.
Make sure you do!

00:27:56.250 --> 00:27:59.650
If this tastes bad,
you have to go out with me. Deal?

00:27:59.850 --> 00:28:02.850
And if it's good,
don't you ever say that to me again.

00:28:03.450 --> 00:28:05.090
What happened to my angel?

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:06.690
Hey!

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:08.690
What kind of a guitar costs
over 3,000 dollars?

00:28:08.790 --> 00:28:11.760
- Settle in court, or do I press charges?
- What am I supposed to do?

00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:15.170
If it's truly Jung Suk Hee, there's no way
she would've stayed quiet until now.

00:28:15.970 --> 00:28:17.930
Once I confirm it with my own two eyes,

00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:20.000
then it will all make sense.
