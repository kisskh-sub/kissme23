WEBVTT

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.776
=His Chosen Favor=

00:00:24.192 --> 00:00:26.976
(The nest of tenderness,
not the path of thorns, will trap us)

00:00:27.168 --> 00:00:29.856
=Episode 18=

00:00:32.128 --> 00:00:33.048
Yindan.

00:00:33.048 --> 00:00:34.448
Your Highness, you're awake.

00:00:36.128 --> 00:00:37.488
Fu An, where's Yindan?

00:00:38.408 --> 00:00:40.408
I don't know. Please save His Majesty!

00:00:40.408 --> 00:00:42.008
His Majesty might be in grave danger.

00:00:42.408 --> 00:00:43.328
Where is His Majesty?

00:00:43.328 --> 00:00:45.088
He went to Zhongcui Mountain
to save you.

00:00:46.288 --> 00:00:47.488
Zhongcui Mountain?

00:00:47.488 --> 00:00:48.208
Yes.

00:00:48.808 --> 00:00:50.248
How long has he been gone?

00:00:50.248 --> 00:00:51.248
Two hours.

00:00:53.088 --> 00:00:54.968
Fu An, prepare a boat for me.

00:00:54.968 --> 00:00:55.808
Yes.

00:01:24.968 --> 00:01:26.144
Xiao Wenjing.

00:01:27.048 --> 00:01:28.608
Where are you, Xiao Wenjing?

00:01:35.328 --> 00:01:36.328
Xiao Wenjing!

00:01:41.768 --> 00:01:42.808
Xiao Wenjing!

00:01:43.808 --> 00:01:45.408
How are you, Xiao Wenjing?

00:01:46.368 --> 00:01:47.408
Xiao Wenjing!

00:01:58.488 --> 00:01:59.688
Your poison was cured?

00:02:01.568 --> 00:02:03.208
I don't know what happened.

00:02:03.208 --> 00:02:04.448
Soon after you left the palace,

00:02:04.448 --> 00:02:06.048
my poison cured.

00:02:06.808 --> 00:02:08.168
(Before leaving the palace,)

00:02:08.168 --> 00:02:09.824
(Yindan gave Zhen'er the antidote).

00:02:10.248 --> 00:02:12.968
(She just tricked me
into taking the poison).

00:02:13.808 --> 00:02:14.648
Well.

00:02:14.648 --> 00:02:15.648
Take a rest.

00:02:15.648 --> 00:02:16.688
I'll find the antidote.

00:02:19.008 --> 00:02:20.128
Don't take him away!

00:02:21.048 --> 00:02:22.088
Consort Xi!

00:02:22.808 --> 00:02:24.008
Put him down

00:02:24.808 --> 00:02:26.248
and I'll let you go.

00:02:29.328 --> 00:02:30.888
Whether you are human or ghost,

00:02:30.888 --> 00:02:32.128
Xiao Wenjing did not kill you.

00:02:32.448 --> 00:02:33.608
Why seeking revenge on him?

00:02:33.608 --> 00:02:34.808
I'm letting you go.

00:02:34.808 --> 00:02:36.088
Don't kill the wrong target.

00:02:37.208 --> 00:02:38.208
If I kill him,

00:02:39.008 --> 00:02:40.688
you can marry Prince Rui

00:02:40.688 --> 00:02:43.008
and leave the palace with Yindan.

00:02:43.008 --> 00:02:44.448
Why are you helping him?

00:02:44.568 --> 00:02:45.488
What did you say?

00:02:49.328 --> 00:02:49.888
This

00:02:49.888 --> 00:02:52.008
is the bracelet I gave Yindan.

00:02:54.128 --> 00:02:54.728
Yindan?

00:02:54.728 --> 00:02:55.568
Don't call me that.

00:02:56.488 --> 00:02:57.408
I'm not Yindan!

00:02:57.408 --> 00:02:58.248
Yindan,

00:02:58.568 --> 00:03:00.048
why do you want to kill him?

00:03:00.048 --> 00:03:01.648
I said I'm not Yindan!

00:03:01.648 --> 00:03:03.088
Fine, you're not Yindan.

00:03:03.088 --> 00:03:04.128
You are Consort Xi.

00:03:04.448 --> 00:03:06.088
But why do you want to kill him?

00:03:07.688 --> 00:03:09.288
Naturally,

00:03:09.288 --> 00:03:11.288
blood must be paid with blood.

00:03:11.288 --> 00:03:13.888
She said the late emperor caused
her parents' wrongful deaths.

00:03:15.048 --> 00:03:17.048
She infiltrated the palace

00:03:17.048 --> 00:03:18.728
to seek revenge on me.

00:03:18.728 --> 00:03:19.648
What?

00:03:19.648 --> 00:03:21.248
I don't want to be your enemy.

00:03:21.328 --> 00:03:21.968
Yindan,

00:03:22.768 --> 00:03:24.608
Xiao Wenjing didn't kill your parents.

00:03:24.608 --> 00:03:26.048
I vouch for it with my honor.

00:03:26.048 --> 00:03:27.328
There must be misunderstanding.

00:03:27.328 --> 00:03:29.128
I heard it with my own ears.

00:03:29.568 --> 00:03:31.928
The murderer said it himself

00:03:31.928 --> 00:03:35.968
the late emperor ordered him
to eliminate us.

00:03:39.528 --> 00:03:40.568
Xiao Wenjing,

00:03:40.568 --> 00:03:42.408
did you know it or not?

00:03:43.448 --> 00:03:44.768
No.

00:03:44.768 --> 00:03:46.608
I had no knowledge of it.

00:03:46.608 --> 00:03:48.008
Of course you wouldn't know me.

00:03:48.448 --> 00:03:49.928
My parents and I

00:03:49.928 --> 00:03:51.168
were nothing but ants to you,

00:03:52.048 --> 00:03:53.808
so you don't know us.

00:03:54.088 --> 00:03:54.608
Yindan.

00:03:55.128 --> 00:03:56.168
He wouldn't.

00:03:56.888 --> 00:03:58.728
He, he wouldn't.

00:04:00.408 --> 00:04:01.848
If you don't leave now,

00:04:02.328 --> 00:04:03.888
I'll kill you too!

00:04:04.768 --> 00:04:05.928
Go!

00:04:06.768 --> 00:04:07.928
Go!

00:04:07.928 --> 00:04:09.368
If you don't let him go,

00:04:09.928 --> 00:04:11.648
kill me as well.

00:04:13.528 --> 00:04:14.208
Why?

00:04:16.328 --> 00:04:18.328
Why are you helping him?

00:04:19.088 --> 00:04:19.888
Yindan,

00:04:20.888 --> 00:04:22.168
I'm not helping him.

00:04:22.808 --> 00:04:25.368
He is certainly not a good man,

00:04:25.368 --> 00:04:26.768
but he does not lie.

00:04:27.928 --> 00:04:30.808
I don't want you to kill
the wrong target.

00:04:32.608 --> 00:04:33.408
Yindan,

00:04:33.848 --> 00:04:35.088
believe me.

00:04:36.048 --> 00:04:36.896
Please

00:04:37.408 --> 00:04:40.048
believe me one more time.

00:04:43.328 --> 00:04:44.568
Stop suspecting Yindan.

00:04:45.008 --> 00:04:47.608
Everyone in this hall answers to me,

00:04:47.608 --> 00:04:48.488
except her.

00:04:49.528 --> 00:04:50.888
It absolutely couldn't be her.

00:04:51.104 --> 00:04:52.416
I've investigated it thoroughly.

00:04:52.416 --> 00:04:54.656
Yindan's father, Lou An,
a Medical Pavilion academician,

00:04:54.656 --> 00:04:56.800
offended the late emperor
and got his family executed.

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.888
She is here for revenge.

00:04:59.768 --> 00:05:01.208
She has gone mad.

00:05:01.208 --> 00:05:02.488
To avenge, she harmed you.

00:05:03.168 --> 00:05:05.208
Even if she hurt me,

00:05:05.208 --> 00:05:06.688
don't harm her.

00:05:23.448 --> 00:05:25.504
Here's the antidote. Take it.

00:05:28.888 --> 00:05:30.808
I'll help you

00:05:30.808 --> 00:05:32.288
uncover the truth.

00:05:57.848 --> 00:06:00.368
So Her Majesty's fire
was also your doing?

00:06:00.368 --> 00:06:01.168
Yes.

00:06:01.688 --> 00:06:02.488
For my revenge,

00:06:03.248 --> 00:06:05.328
all royals must die.

00:06:07.688 --> 00:06:09.848
Why didn't you kill Prince Rui too?

00:06:11.168 --> 00:06:13.368
He just returned from the frontier.

00:06:13.368 --> 00:06:15.288
He's clean, not like you.

00:06:17.248 --> 00:06:18.328
Alright.

00:06:18.328 --> 00:06:19.208
Skip Prince Rui.

00:06:19.848 --> 00:06:20.368
Yindan,

00:06:20.688 --> 00:06:23.048
how did your parents die?

00:06:23.528 --> 00:06:26.128
My father, Lou An, concocted elixirs
for the late emperor.

00:06:27.328 --> 00:06:28.448
That morning,

00:06:28.808 --> 00:06:30.488
he told me and my mother,

00:06:30.488 --> 00:06:32.288
his elixir would be completed that day.

00:06:32.928 --> 00:06:34.128
Once the elixir was finished,

00:06:34.128 --> 00:06:37.088
he would take me and my mother away

00:06:37.088 --> 00:06:39.088
from the capital, a troublesome place.

00:06:39.768 --> 00:06:42.368
But that day, my father

00:06:42.368 --> 00:06:44.688
didn't return even until the Zi hour.

00:06:44.968 --> 00:06:46.808
My mother and I
couldn't wait any longer,

00:06:47.488 --> 00:06:48.688
so we decided to sleep.

00:06:50.568 --> 00:06:54.088
We had just lain down
when we heard noises.

00:06:54.968 --> 00:06:57.408
My mother pushed me into the cellar.

00:06:58.128 --> 00:06:59.608
The next day,

00:06:59.608 --> 00:07:01.768
when I crawled out of the cellar,

00:07:03.088 --> 00:07:03.808
I

00:07:04.688 --> 00:07:06.928
only found her corpse.

00:07:09.168 --> 00:07:10.208
So,

00:07:10.528 --> 00:07:12.608
you infiltrated the imperial selection

00:07:12.608 --> 00:07:14.608
to assassinate Xiao Wenjing?

00:07:14.608 --> 00:07:15.848
Yes.

00:07:15.848 --> 00:07:18.568
But I never expected that selection

00:07:18.568 --> 00:07:20.088
wasn't for the new emperor's consorts,

00:07:20.488 --> 00:07:22.488
but for burial consorts.

00:07:23.528 --> 00:07:25.128
I never expected to meet you.

00:07:25.768 --> 00:07:27.008
You saved me.

00:07:28.368 --> 00:07:29.808
This wasn't my doing.

00:07:31.288 --> 00:07:33.088
Seems more like
Empress Dowager Chen's doing.

00:07:33.728 --> 00:07:35.928
But the guards in black clearly said
"His Majesty".

00:07:35.928 --> 00:07:37.288
I heard it very clearly.

00:07:38.368 --> 00:07:39.848
You mean

00:07:39.848 --> 00:07:41.328
I sent them to kill you,

00:07:42.048 --> 00:07:44.408
and asked them to tell you it's my order

00:07:45.088 --> 00:07:46.208
and let you go,

00:07:46.648 --> 00:07:48.248
so that eighteen years later,

00:07:48.248 --> 00:07:50.208
you'd come back to kill my family?

00:07:51.208 --> 00:07:52.608
I'm not that stupid.

00:07:53.368 --> 00:07:54.048
Wait.

00:07:54.648 --> 00:07:56.408
I feel it is

00:07:57.648 --> 00:07:58.688
a bit strange.

00:07:59.208 --> 00:08:00.088
What's strange?

00:08:00.768 --> 00:08:01.888
It's hard to explain.

00:08:02.608 --> 00:08:03.208
Yindan,

00:08:03.568 --> 00:08:04.888
did your father

00:08:04.888 --> 00:08:06.808
succeed in making the elixir?

00:08:06.808 --> 00:08:07.688
I don't know.

00:08:08.328 --> 00:08:10.008
He rarely spoke

00:08:10.008 --> 00:08:11.408
of the elixir-making.

00:08:12.528 --> 00:08:13.728
If he had made it,

00:08:14.968 --> 00:08:17.048
the late emperor wouldn't have died.

00:08:17.728 --> 00:08:18.808
True.

00:08:20.008 --> 00:08:22.408
Yindan, don't cry.

00:08:22.768 --> 00:08:24.448
I'll help you uncover the truth.

00:08:24.848 --> 00:08:25.688
Your Highness,

00:08:27.288 --> 00:08:28.248
I'm sorry.

00:08:28.768 --> 00:08:30.328
Why are you apologizing?

00:08:30.928 --> 00:08:32.208
I used you.

00:08:33.448 --> 00:08:34.728
But you didn't harm me.

00:08:39.808 --> 00:08:40.768
Are you alright?

00:08:48.728 --> 00:08:50.848
From now on, let's live well together.

00:08:50.848 --> 00:08:52.488
Tell me whatever troubles you.

00:08:52.488 --> 00:08:53.608
I'll help you.

00:08:55.568 --> 00:08:56.168
Okay.

00:09:00.848 --> 00:09:01.808
Lu Zhen'er,

00:09:01.808 --> 00:09:03.728
I've lifted your house arrest.

00:09:03.728 --> 00:09:05.288
Why don't bake back at the Zhaohua Hall

00:09:05.288 --> 00:09:06.248
instead of here?

00:09:06.688 --> 00:09:08.328
Yindan's birthday is coming.

00:09:08.328 --> 00:09:09.648
I'm preparing a surprise for her,

00:09:09.648 --> 00:09:10.968
so can't bake at the Zhaohua Hall.

00:09:12.168 --> 00:09:13.608
You really treat her well.

00:09:13.608 --> 00:09:14.848
Of course.

00:09:14.848 --> 00:09:17.168
She's my own sister.

00:09:17.168 --> 00:09:19.088
After I celebrate her birthday,

00:09:19.088 --> 00:09:20.528
I'll help her find the murderer.

00:09:21.608 --> 00:09:23.448
She is indeed your own sister.

00:09:23.448 --> 00:09:25.688
Scheming meticulously and playing tricks

00:09:25.688 --> 00:09:27.568
to preserve that image

00:09:27.568 --> 00:09:29.048
of the perfect sister in your mind.

00:09:30.368 --> 00:09:32.128
It means she genuinely cares for me.

00:09:41.088 --> 00:09:42.448
What are you doing?

00:09:44.048 --> 00:09:45.568
I'm hungry. Getting a snack.

00:09:46.928 --> 00:09:48.448
Go to the imperial kitchen for food.

00:09:48.448 --> 00:09:49.888
I have no food for you.

00:09:54.008 --> 00:09:54.648
Lu Zhen'er,

00:09:55.208 --> 00:09:57.088
I came alone to save you.

00:09:57.088 --> 00:09:58.048
Aren't you touched?

00:09:58.648 --> 00:10:00.248
Well, I saved you too.

00:10:00.248 --> 00:10:01.328
If it weren't for me,

00:10:01.328 --> 00:10:02.288
you'd have died.

00:10:05.928 --> 00:10:07.568
I'm very grateful for that.

00:10:08.248 --> 00:10:09.248
And you?

00:10:09.768 --> 00:10:11.488
You dragged me into this!

00:10:11.488 --> 00:10:13.088
You charging to your death to save me

00:10:13.088 --> 00:10:14.328
is just what you owed me!

00:10:14.328 --> 00:10:15.568
Why should I be touched?

00:10:23.208 --> 00:10:24.768
Lu Zhen'er,

00:10:24.768 --> 00:10:25.808
you're heartless.

00:10:26.488 --> 00:10:28.288
No, I'm not.

00:10:28.288 --> 00:10:30.208
But your petty favors

00:10:30.208 --> 00:10:31.968
can't erase the pain you caused me.

00:10:35.448 --> 00:10:36.488
Now leave.

00:10:36.488 --> 00:10:37.688
I need to finish this cake.

00:11:02.408 --> 00:11:03.688
Greetings, Your Majesty.

00:11:05.168 --> 00:11:05.968
Rise.

00:11:08.728 --> 00:11:10.008
Your Majesty,

00:11:10.008 --> 00:11:12.008
I've long wished to tell you something.

00:11:13.448 --> 00:11:15.288
Do not fail Her Highness.

00:11:18.248 --> 00:11:19.168
I understand.

00:11:45.008 --> 00:11:46.088
Why summon me again?

00:11:46.088 --> 00:11:47.248
My cake isn't finished!

00:11:50.528 --> 00:11:51.248
Look.

00:11:56.544 --> 00:11:58.367
(Succession to Lu Zhen'er)

00:11:58.688 --> 00:11:59.888
An edict of succession?

00:12:00.208 --> 00:12:00.808
Yes.

00:12:00.808 --> 00:12:02.168
Passing the throne to me?

00:12:02.968 --> 00:12:04.088
Are you insane? Or dying?

00:12:05.208 --> 00:12:06.888
I've thought it over.

00:12:06.888 --> 00:12:07.768
You were right.

00:12:08.048 --> 00:12:10.432
Even if I return to the real world now,

00:12:11.608 --> 00:12:13.608
I probably won't adjust
to the modern life.

00:12:14.768 --> 00:12:16.728
Better to live well here.

00:12:16.728 --> 00:12:18.448
Cherish the present.

00:12:19.608 --> 00:12:21.792
But that doesn't mean abdicating to me!

00:12:22.768 --> 00:12:24.256
Don't you want to be Empress Regnant?

00:12:25.448 --> 00:12:27.608
I don't.

00:12:27.608 --> 00:12:29.328
That's bitter toil.

00:12:30.088 --> 00:12:31.608
Can't beat

00:12:31.608 --> 00:12:34.488
the joy of being a lazy slacker.

00:12:34.728 --> 00:12:35.808
But previously...

00:12:36.768 --> 00:12:38.648
I wanted to be Empress Regnant,

00:12:38.648 --> 00:12:40.648
because you made me the target of all.

00:12:41.208 --> 00:12:42.248
You made me realize

00:12:42.248 --> 00:12:43.528
that in this harem,

00:12:43.528 --> 00:12:45.696
without power, survival is impossible.

00:12:46.528 --> 00:12:48.688
The nest of tenderness,
not the path of thorns,

00:12:48.688 --> 00:12:50.008
will trap us.

00:12:51.168 --> 00:12:52.032
Xiao Wenjing,

00:12:52.528 --> 00:12:54.408
if you sincerely love me

00:12:54.408 --> 00:12:55.008
and protect me,

00:12:55.608 --> 00:12:58.168
perhaps I'll remain Consort Lu,

00:12:58.848 --> 00:13:00.928
indulging in pleasure under your wing.

00:13:01.928 --> 00:13:03.200
But even if I spare you

00:13:04.048 --> 00:13:05.848
and treat you with sincerity,

00:13:06.848 --> 00:13:08.640
you'd fight for justice for the people,

00:13:09.128 --> 00:13:11.208
because of the world's unfairness.

00:13:12.008 --> 00:13:13.008
You pity the weak,

00:13:13.008 --> 00:13:14.368
yearn for universal harmony.

00:13:14.968 --> 00:13:17.288
You seek power, not for yourself.

00:13:18.168 --> 00:13:20.088
Even immersing in tenderness,

00:13:21.208 --> 00:13:24.328
you'd rage against those who abuse power

00:13:24.608 --> 00:13:27.264
and moved by the wretched

00:13:27.768 --> 00:13:28.648
clinging to life.

00:13:33.688 --> 00:13:34.648
Xiao Wenjing,

00:13:34.928 --> 00:13:36.288
what's wrong with you?

00:13:36.288 --> 00:13:37.728
Don't put a heavy filter on me.

00:13:38.328 --> 00:13:39.424
Truthfully,

00:13:40.368 --> 00:13:42.208
you're a good person.

00:13:42.208 --> 00:13:43.848
Stop sweet-talking me!

00:13:51.608 --> 00:13:52.888
I'm not sweet-talking you.

00:13:53.488 --> 00:13:55.088
I want to reconcile.

00:13:58.488 --> 00:13:59.688
Reconcile?

00:13:59.688 --> 00:14:01.088
It's not that simple!

00:14:02.288 --> 00:14:04.288
I need to observe you longer.

00:14:06.048 --> 00:14:06.728
How long?

00:14:09.608 --> 00:14:10.368
Depends on my mood.

00:14:19.048 --> 00:14:19.808
Come on.

00:14:19.808 --> 00:14:21.328
