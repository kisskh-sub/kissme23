WEBVTT

00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:03.340
What is it? Is there really an opening?

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.540
It's for the grand reopening party
at Dream Hotel.

00:00:05.840 --> 00:00:08.750
It's a private party,
invitation-only for VIPs.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:10.280
So security will be super tight,
and it'll be a tough gig.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.850
But the tougher the job,
the better the pay, right?

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:15.050
Thanks so much.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.090
Okay!

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.360
Jang Mi.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:21.790
Someone called after seeing the banner.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:23.290
They said they saw your mom.

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:24.630
Are you serious?

00:00:24.630 --> 00:00:25.760
I'm telling you, it's true.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.070
What did they say?
Did they see who hurt Mom?

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.100
They couldn't talk over the phone,
so I agreed to meet them tomorrow.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:33.540
Let me come with you, Dad.

00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:34.810
Of course.

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:51.620
You're not going to wear the outfit
I brought, CEO Chae?

00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:53.490
Didn't you hear me the first time?

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:54.890
Fine.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.630
I'm leaving then, Hwa Young.

00:01:13.510 --> 00:01:14.510
Who could that be?

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:16.080
Who's there?

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:18.950
It's me.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:27.930
CEO Chae! What a surprise.
What brings you to a place like this?

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.130
Oh my!

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.930
I should've known I was raising a viper.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.630
- What's wrong with you?
- What's wrong with me?

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.770
What's wrong with me?

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:39.070
- You're asking me what's wrong with me?
- Yes, I am!

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.140
What do you think you're doing,
barging into my house like this?

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:47.150
I'm not your paid stylist anymore.
Don't get it wrong!

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:50.880
You're the one who's got it wrong.
How dare you aim out of your league?

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.050
Someone like you, daring to take the place
beside my father-in-law?

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.960
That's why you've been visiting my home?
You had this ulterior motive all along?

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.430
It's a misunderstanding.

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:05.830
CEO Chae, we're friends.
How could I go after your father-in-law?

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.370
Cut the nonsense. It looks like
you've been plotting this all along,

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.470
so dream on!

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.310
Do you honestly think someone like you
is fit to be the lady of Dream Group?

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:17.840
- Hwa Young...
- Not a chance! If you even thought that,

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.480
I'm here to tell you to dream on.
You'd better listen up.

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:25.850
Are you crying?

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:31.090
I didn't even do anything.

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:35.290
I'm humiliated like this
by my friend of 30 years,

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:40.370
- so I can't help but cry.
- Humiliation? You had it coming.

00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.770
- How dare a tramp like you seduce him?
- That's a misunderstanding.

00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:48.870
The Chairman adores me.
What am I supposed to do about it?

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:53.240
I truly only admired
the Chairman from afar,

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:55.950
but it seems the Chairman...

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.220
has been hiding his feelings
all this time too.

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:01.490
He told me that from now on,
I don't have to say I'm sorry...

00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:05.260
- or feel bad about anything.
- He said what?

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:09.760
That proves how much he cares for me,
isn't it?

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.630
They say you can't hide love or a cough.

00:03:13.830 --> 00:03:16.100
And it couldn't be truer.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.870
Love knows no age or borders, after all.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:23.110
- Social status means nothing, right?
- Hey, Yeom San Wol!

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.310
Instead of taking this out on me,

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:27.880
you should go take it up
with the Chairman.

00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:32.820
Right. That would solve everything,
wouldn't it?

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.920
Look at you, running that mouth of yours.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:38.320
What? I've heard enough.

00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.330
You're playing with fire.
And don't you dare talk about love!

00:03:41.830 --> 00:03:43.600
Don't make me laugh.

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:45.600
My back...

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.100
I'm warning you.

00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:50.570
If you keep this up,
things are going to get ugly.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.610
Stay away from my house.
And if you see my father-in-law again,

00:03:55.010 --> 00:03:56.640
that will be your last day on Earth.

00:03:57.010 --> 00:03:59.310
And your daughter, Hong Ju,
won't get away unscathed either.

00:04:00.110 --> 00:04:01.380
Mark my words.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.430
Fine, Chae Hwa Young.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.730
No matter how much you rage,
you'll still be my daughter-in-law.

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:21.070
Just you wait.

00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:35.770
Cheers.

00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:51.190
- Should we get going?
- Yes, let's.

00:05:51.190 --> 00:05:52.190
- Yes.
- Sounds good.

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:53.560
- All right, let's head out.
- Okay.

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:58.500
- Okay.
- I'll be off then.

00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:05.170
There.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.880
Honey, why are you calling
instead of coming home?

00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:14.910
Baek Ho and Jun Ho got home early,

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:16.910
and we're all waiting
to have dinner with you.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:20.820
Jun Ho, you can eat at this hour
because your restaurant hasn't opened yet.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.690
Yes, I'll be swamped once we're open.

00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:26.660
All right. Just don't drink too much.
You'll make yourself sick.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:28.230
Okay.

00:06:33.430 --> 00:06:34.430
What?

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.870
- Professor Kang.
- Hello.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.940
What are you doing here alone
at this hour?

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.810
Why do you ask? Are you surprised
that I'm drinking here...

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:46.140
all by myself?

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.010
Yes, a little.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.780
Don't be.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.320
I just have a lot on my mind.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.590
I need some time like this to myself, too.

00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.730
Yes, I understand.

00:07:09.330 --> 00:07:11.940
After all, the role of a CEO...

00:07:12.370 --> 00:07:14.910
is a lonely and isolating one.

00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.710
You're always at a crossroads,
wondering whether to go this way...

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.610
or that one.

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:25.950
You always have to make
the final decision alone.

00:07:27.190 --> 00:07:29.290
And the weight of that responsibility
is immense.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.390
And it's not like...

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:38.760
anyone else truly understands
the hardship and loneliness.

00:07:39.730 --> 00:07:42.330
You have enemies on all sides
trying to drag you down,

00:07:42.730 --> 00:07:44.000
glaring at you.

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:48.310
The choking pain you feel
just trying to survive...

00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:51.580
has to be endured without letting it show.

00:07:54.310 --> 00:07:55.680
Being at the very top...

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:58.550
is always that lonely, isn't it?

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.120
Wait.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.820
I'm sorry if I've overstepped...

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:06.620
I'm sorry.

00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.930
Don't be. I'm the one
who spoke out of turn.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:15.070
No, it's not that.

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.440
I feel like you're the first person
who's ever truly understood me,

00:08:20.070 --> 00:08:21.540
and I just got choked up.

00:08:25.710 --> 00:08:27.010
I'm not one to cry.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.480
I can't even remember the last time
I cried like this.

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.150
Thank you...

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:36.890
for letting me cry.

00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.760
I've always seen you
as a glamorous and untouchable icon,

00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.570
but the loneliness
and vulnerability behind that.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:51.340
It's the first time I've seen it.

00:08:52.770 --> 00:08:53.770
An icon?

00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:57.380
We're probably about the same age.

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:01.450
Back in school,
you were the star on my folder.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:05.880
For pretty much every guy my age,

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:09.450
the actress Chae Hwa Young
was our number one celebrity crush.

00:09:10.960 --> 00:09:11.960
And now...

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.130
you're my icon.

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:17.660
Excuse me?

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:20.400
Because you understood how I feel.

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:35.780
Mom.

00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:41.190
We're going to find the person
who did this to you soon.

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:42.750
We can find them.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.420
Yes.

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:47.290
I'm meeting a witness tomorrow.

00:09:47.560 --> 00:09:51.100
I'll find them and teach them a lesson
they won't forget.

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.060
"Teach them a lesson?"
What does that mean?

00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:56.000
My pretty mom.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:00.070
Mom.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.040
No matter what anyone else says,

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:07.280
I'm just so happy
to have you here with me.

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:10.480
I like Jang Mi.

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:13.720
Suk Hee likes Jang Mi too.

00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:16.750
Jang Mi is pretty.

00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:33.570
Hello, sir, are you here about the banner?

00:10:33.570 --> 00:10:34.810
Yes. That's me.

00:10:34.810 --> 00:10:37.140
- Hello.
- Hello there.

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:42.980
So you're saying you saw my wife, Suk Hee,
a long time ago?

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.850
Yes, I think the place was...

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:47.920
Taean, if I remember correctly.

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.790
So, about the reward you mentioned,

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:53.020
how much are you offering?

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:56.290
We'll have to agree on that
before I say anything.

00:10:56.490 --> 00:11:00.300
I'll give you what you ask.
I'll make sure you're not disappointed.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.370
Come on,
you have to give me a firm number.

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:05.870
Being so vague about it...

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:08.740
- puts me in a tough spot.
- 1,000 dollars.

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.270
How about 1,000 dollars?

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:11.740
Dad!

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:15.250
Come on. I need at least 5,000 dollars.

00:11:15.550 --> 00:11:18.150
This is premium information
we're talking about.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:20.180
Fine.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:24.560
If your tip is credible,
you'll get the money.

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:29.860
- You saw my Suk Hee in Taean?
- Yes.

00:11:30.190 --> 00:11:34.530
- She was running away, crying hard...
- Was she crying?

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:38.200
Yes, it looked like someone
just took scissors to her hair.

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:40.810
It was all choppy,
almost like a man's haircut.

00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:42.810
Suk Hee!

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:48.310
Hold on.

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:50.820
What did you say about her hair?

00:11:51.250 --> 00:11:54.820
Yes, it was choppy and spiky.
Like a crew cut. Really short.

00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:00.830
Where in Taean was she?

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:03.060
That woman...

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:05.630
was the daughter of the family who lived
in the house with a persimmon tree.

00:12:06.100 --> 00:12:09.000
- Her father came chasing after her and...
- That's enough.

00:12:10.230 --> 00:12:11.240
Let's go, Jang Mi.

00:12:12.100 --> 00:12:13.100
Okay, Dad.

00:12:15.510 --> 00:12:16.970
That's not my mom you're talking about.

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:31.790
Dad.

00:12:33.590 --> 00:12:35.060
Don't take it too hard.

00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.600
- I know.
- Of all the calls about the banner,

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:43.570
we didn't think we'd get a solid lead
on the first try, did we?

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.500
You're right.

00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.040
But I had a feeling this one was real.

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.940
You've been searching every single year,

00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:54.910
but there hasn’t been
a single witness, right?

00:12:55.650 --> 00:12:58.350
There's no reason to get so disappointed
all over again, Dad. Okay?

00:13:00.320 --> 00:13:01.320
You're right, Jang Mi.

00:13:02.190 --> 00:13:03.990
I won't give up.

00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:08.990
I'm going to find the person who did this
to your mother and make them pay.

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.360
You have to.

00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:12.460
Of course you will.

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:16.300
Let's go.

00:13:28.250 --> 00:13:30.810
That planter looks messy.
Replace it with a different one.

00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.450
And change the color of that logo.

00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:35.990
Change this logo.
And that barrel looks tacky, remove it.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.230
This is a grand reopening.

00:13:41.530 --> 00:13:44.960
This is our chance
to redefine ourselves...

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.800
and make a fresh impression
on our customers....

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:48.900
Yes, ma'am.

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:51.770
Keep that in mind.

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:07.350
Assistant Manager Jin,
the invitations for the reopening party...

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:09.320
are being handled smoothly, right?

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:13.390
- Yes, CEO Chae.
- The Chairman and key clients are coming,

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:17.490
- so everything has to be perfect.
- Understood. I'll make sure of it.

00:14:21.100 --> 00:14:23.730
And is Chef Kang preparing the menu
for our guests...

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.270
without any issues?

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:30.470
Yes, we've hired temps
to cover the staff shortage,

00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:32.140
so everything will go as planned.

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:42.820
What? CEO Chae beat you to a pulp?

00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:44.420
I'm telling you, she did!

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.360
Here, look.

00:14:46.890 --> 00:14:47.960
See? It's all red and swollen.

00:14:48.460 --> 00:14:49.690
It doesn't look like anything to me.

00:14:50.530 --> 00:14:54.300
But now that CEO Chae knows about you
and Chairman Ma, what do we do?

00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:55.370
What do you mean, "what do we do?"

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:58.170
You think I'm going to let this stop me
when I'm so close?

00:14:58.500 --> 00:14:59.500
Mom.

00:15:00.070 --> 00:15:02.440
- Are you really that confident?
- Of course I am.

00:15:03.370 --> 00:15:06.580
I've almost got Chairman Ma
wrapped around my little finger.

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.450
Just you wait.

00:15:09.010 --> 00:15:12.920
- All I have to do is let it simmer.
- You always say to "let it simmer."

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.990
- How many times have I heard that?
- This time is different, I swear.

00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:20.420
I'm going to play hardball.
It's do or die.

00:15:21.330 --> 00:15:23.160
With Hwa Young knowing
that I’m associated with Chairman Ma,

00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:26.660
there’s no way I’m backing down.

00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:50.690
Chef Kang.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:53.120
You've finished selecting the menu
for the reopening party, right?

00:15:53.290 --> 00:15:54.290
I'm working on it.

00:15:54.360 --> 00:15:57.130
The CEO said to make sure
there are no issues.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:58.430
Understood.

00:15:59.300 --> 00:16:01.470
Nothing's sexier than a man hard at work.

00:16:03.230 --> 00:16:06.870
Director Ma, the CEO is calling for you,
so you'd better go see her.

00:16:07.140 --> 00:16:08.840
And stop distracting him from his work.

00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:11.240
What? Am I distracting him?

00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.110
I'm giving him my moral support.

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:16.310
I don't have to go
just because the CEO called.

00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:19.720
What do you mean you don't have to go?
I've delivered the message.

00:16:19.780 --> 00:16:22.150
I'm sure she's just going to nag me
about working hard.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:24.860
Do you think I don't know my own mother?

00:16:29.760 --> 00:16:30.760
Chairman.

00:16:31.530 --> 00:16:35.200
This is the last gift I'll be giving you.

00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:38.270
A final gift?

00:16:40.040 --> 00:16:43.510
After how badly CEO Chae
beat me yesterday,

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:48.780
my face still stings,
and I can barely even open my mouth.

00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:50.110
She hit you?

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:54.690
You're saying Seo Rin's mother hit you?

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:57.120
- How dare she...
- I deserved it.

00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:00.860
It's what I get for daring
to admire you, Chairman.

00:17:01.330 --> 00:17:04.800
What are you talking about?
That she’d lay a hand on you...

00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:06.500
That's outrageous!

00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.970
This is a direct insult to me.
How dare she!

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:14.070
Chairman, please calm down.
You'll raise your blood pressure.

00:17:16.510 --> 00:17:18.810
As long as you're healthy,

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:21.680
nothing else matters to me.

00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:24.520
I'll just long for you from afar,

00:17:24.820 --> 00:17:27.350
praying endlessly for your well-being.

00:17:28.120 --> 00:17:30.150
I can live as if I'm already dead.

00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:32.960
- I'd be perfectly fine living like that.
- Mrs. Yeom, don't say that.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:35.230
- What do you mean, "from afar"?
- No, I must.

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:39.660
CEO Chae told me never
to set foot in here again...

00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:43.970
and gave me a terrifying warning
not to come anywhere near you.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:49.040
I have to do as she says.
Otherwise, she'll tear me to pieces.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.010
Please accept this, Chairman.

00:17:54.210 --> 00:17:58.880
What's gotten into you?
Come on, stop it and sit down, all right?

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:02.720
Chairman.

00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:06.890
All right. I understand how you feel,

00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:08.560
so don't talk about leaving.

00:18:08.930 --> 00:18:11.460
And I'll have a word with Seo Rin's mother
and make her understand.

00:18:15.670 --> 00:18:16.670
Unbelievable.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.770
What's the update on Jung Suk Hee?

00:18:22.410 --> 00:18:25.710
The banner is still up, and all is quiet.
Nothing to report.

00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:30.310
But still, I have a bad feeling
about that banner.

00:18:31.150 --> 00:18:33.120
This won't do.
We have to get it taken down.

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:37.090
Call the district office right now
and report it as an illegal banner.

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:46.900
Wait a minute.

00:18:54.070 --> 00:18:56.070
(Certificate in Western Cuisine,
Congratulations on passing, Oh Jang Mi)

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:00.780
Jang Mi's so happy.

00:19:00.780 --> 00:19:02.210
Jang Mi feels good.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:07.180
- Are you that happy about passing?
- Yes. I could stare at this all day.

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:11.460
And to think you had to bottle up
something you love so much.

00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:15.060
Dad, I wasn't holding anything back.

00:19:15.130 --> 00:19:19.760
You even got into college,
but Tae Sook ran off with your tuition,

00:19:20.430 --> 00:19:21.770
so you gave up college.

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:24.640
- Whenever your brother caused trouble...
- Dad.

00:19:25.100 --> 00:19:26.240
I'm fine, really.

00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:29.770
There goes Dad
with his greatest hit again.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:34.680
You have to finish the set list.
How Jang Mi got into chef school abroad,

00:19:34.750 --> 00:19:36.510
but you had to give it all up
when Mom was hospitalized.

00:19:36.580 --> 00:19:39.680
Shut up. This is all your fault!

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:42.550
It hurts. My brain’s not that great.
Why are you hitting me on the head again?

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.290
It's your fault she didn't go to college,
you jerk!

00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:48.860
Jang Mi, it's not too late.

00:19:49.530 --> 00:19:52.160
Go back to school now.
Study whatever you want.

00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:54.930
Dad, school? At my age?

00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:58.870
Don't worry.
I'll be working under Chef Kang Jun Ho,

00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:02.440
and I'll become his star pupil and achieve
my three-Michelin-star dream.

00:20:03.070 --> 00:20:04.070
I promise.

00:20:06.340 --> 00:20:08.650
(Pajama OOTD)

00:20:13.850 --> 00:20:15.550
What do you think you're doing?
You're so rude.

00:20:15.920 --> 00:20:17.490
Did you forget
the Public Relations Team...

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:19.320
said not to post pictures
on your social media?

00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.930
My face isn't even in it.
Don't be so dramatic.

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:25.960
Why are you dying to post this garbage?
Are you some kind of celebrity?

00:20:26.030 --> 00:20:27.830
It's my social media account.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:31.740
Why are you and the PR team overreacting
when I can post whatever I want?

00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.370
We'll soon begin transferring
the Dream Group shares to you.

00:20:35.710 --> 00:20:38.840
Once that happens,
all eyes will be on you.

00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:43.780
But leaving behind a messy trail like this
will only cheapen your image.

00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:46.920
Can you please just not do the things
I tell you not to?

00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:48.620
Give it a rest.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:56.090
- This looks so real, Mom.
- I know, right? It's adorable.

00:20:58.730 --> 00:21:00.730
- I'm home.
- Welcome back.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:02.300
- Hey.
- You're just getting in?

00:21:02.930 --> 00:21:05.640
Have you eaten, Jun Ho?
I can fix you something if you haven't.

00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:06.900
I already ate.

00:21:08.610 --> 00:21:09.610
More importantly,

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:15.380
Dad, you received it, right?

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.480
You mean the invitation
to the reopening party of the Dream Hotel?

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:20.650
Yes.

00:21:20.650 --> 00:21:23.320
All employees
and their families are invited.

00:21:24.350 --> 00:21:25.560
Does that mean I can go too?

00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:29.560
I won't be able to make it.
I have to be in court for a trial.

00:21:29.860 --> 00:21:31.160
You should go with Baek Ho.

00:21:31.230 --> 00:21:34.430
I'm actually supposed to help someone out.
I should give them a call.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.200
- Really? You're signing the contract?
- That's what I'm telling you.

00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:42.110
Are you sure it's a legitimate agency
this time?

00:21:42.170 --> 00:21:46.340
I told you. I'll make up for the past
in one fell swoop,

00:21:46.410 --> 00:21:49.080
- so just you wait.
- That's so great!

00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:51.820
Mom, he says he'll be on TV every day.

00:21:52.250 --> 00:21:53.580
Tae Pyung is great.

00:21:53.580 --> 00:21:54.950
Tae Pyung is a singer.

00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:59.120
Mom, tell me anything you want.
I'll buy it all for you outright.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.390
- Suk Hee is so excited.
- Come on.

00:22:02.030 --> 00:22:04.860
Tok Hee has an older sister,
and her name is Ok Hee.

00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:07.800
My Tok Hee is so pretty.

00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:10.270
I found my Tok Hee.

00:22:11.230 --> 00:22:13.270
Ok Hee and Tok Hee? I love it.

00:22:19.810 --> 00:22:24.110
I said I'll pay you back! Don't worry,
I'm not going to stiff you.

00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:25.650
What gives you the right to be angry?

00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.680
You've got some nerve turning this on me.

00:22:27.680 --> 00:22:29.490
You should be begging me for more time,
and I'd still decide...

00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:30.520
whether you get more time.

00:22:30.520 --> 00:22:31.720
What gives you the right to be angry?

00:22:31.790 --> 00:22:34.560
It's not that I'm angry.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:40.100
I'm starting a high-paying gig soon,
so I'll definitely pay you back.

00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:41.330
I would never stiff you.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:44.300
How much could that job possibly pay
for you to be so sure you can pay me back?

00:22:44.630 --> 00:22:46.840
You're not really thinking you can repay
the full 3,000 dollars, are you?

00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:49.370
But a high-paying gig?

00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:52.380
- Then could it be...
- Could it be what?

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:54.880
You're not working
at some shady place, are you?

00:22:54.950 --> 00:22:58.420
That's none of your business.
All you need to do is get your money back.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.480
Got it?

00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:04.250
And what's this about 3,000 dollars?
You're trying to pull a fast one.

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.760
Who do you take me for? A pushover?
I'm hanging up.

00:23:07.090 --> 00:23:09.590
- Unbelievable.
- Hello?

00:23:11.330 --> 00:23:12.800
The nerve of her.

00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.930
But a high-paying gig...

00:23:18.300 --> 00:23:19.400
Don't tell me a hostess bar?

00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:21.970
No way...

00:23:23.040 --> 00:23:24.710
She didn't seem like the type
to stoop that low.

00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:27.310
It can't be.

00:23:29.980 --> 00:23:31.210
CEO Chae.

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:32.880
Come have a seat.

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:34.180
Yes, Father.

00:23:37.490 --> 00:23:39.390
You're up late.

00:23:44.330 --> 00:23:46.900
Is there something you want to say?

00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:48.370
Regardless of who I see,

00:23:49.130 --> 00:23:51.330
I don't need your permission, do I?

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:53.940
- Pardon?
- Don't you dare...

00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:55.970
treat Mrs. Yeom so disrespectfully.

00:23:56.670 --> 00:24:00.180
If you keep treating Mrs. Yeom like that,
I won't let it slide.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:04.210
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.350
Father.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:07.620
She's a friend of mine.

00:24:07.950 --> 00:24:10.020
- How could you and my friend...
- Enough.

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:13.420
How dare you meddle
in your father-in-law's affairs?

00:24:14.020 --> 00:24:15.230
I'm sorry, Father.

00:24:16.260 --> 00:24:17.860
I'm worried rumors...

00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:19.630
- will hurt the company’s stock price.
- That's...

00:24:19.900 --> 00:24:21.800
not your concern.

00:24:31.010 --> 00:24:35.380
So that witch Yeom San Wol
snitched on me after all.

00:25:24.630 --> 00:25:27.760
(Dream Hotel Reopening Ceremony)

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:34.770
Oh my goodness.

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:37.510
So this is how the other half lives.

00:25:38.170 --> 00:25:39.440
A world of their own.

00:25:41.210 --> 00:25:45.380
Okay, Jang Mi.
Stop gawking and just make some money.

00:25:54.820 --> 00:25:57.290
(Dream Hotel Reopening Ceremony)

00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:00.860
Thank you.

00:26:02.170 --> 00:26:03.200
Here.

00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.670
- Please.
- Yes, sir. I'm coming.

00:26:09.270 --> 00:26:10.810
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:14.780
Am I seeing things?

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:17.380
She looks a lot like Director Ma.

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:28.660
Jang Mi, let's go to Chang Restaurant
to pick up some appetizers.

00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:30.930
Chang Restaurant?

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:33.930
- Thank you for coming.
- Okay, I'm on it.

00:26:34.460 --> 00:26:36.130
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.200
- Let's go.
- Okay, I'm coming.

00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.140
- Watch the heat so it doesn't burn.
- Yes, Chef.

00:26:45.640 --> 00:26:47.880
- Why are you waiting?
- I'm sorry.

00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:49.480
Drain the potatoes properly.

00:26:50.750 --> 00:26:52.820
- Keep the cuts precise. Five millimeters.
- Got it.

00:27:02.660 --> 00:27:04.630
(Food Service Division)

00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:07.260
- Out of the way. I'll do it.
- Yes, Chef.

00:27:19.510 --> 00:27:20.940
Oh my gosh!

00:27:21.750 --> 00:27:24.710
I can't believe I'm seeing my idol,
Chef Kang Jun Ho, in the flesh.

00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:27.480
Oh my, he's amazing!

00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:45.670
Chang Restaurant.

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:49.170
I'm going to work here one day.
Just you wait.

00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.810
Hello, welcome.

00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:58.880
- Hello.
- Hello.

00:28:08.860 --> 00:28:10.390
- Here is the fruit you requested.
- Thanks.

00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:12.260
- Here.
- It looks good.

00:28:58.480 --> 00:28:59.910
(The First Man)

00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:02.510
- We meet again.
- It seems you got a girlfriend.

00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:05.720
- Just help me out this once.
- And how am I supposed to do that?

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:10.850
These past 30-some years are flashing
before my eyes.

00:29:10.990 --> 00:29:13.760
Why does everyone look so spaced out?
You just came from the party.

00:29:13.890 --> 00:29:15.130
I'm Ma Seo Rin.

00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.890
What?
Why is that obnoxious guitarist here?

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:23.930
