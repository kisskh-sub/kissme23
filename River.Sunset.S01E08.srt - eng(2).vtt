00:01:35.079 --> 00:01:37.159
There's a nurse at our military hospital.

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:38.599
Tang Ju'er.

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:39.480
Tang Ju'er.

00:01:40.480 --> 00:01:42.599
She's about the same age as this Ye Biying.

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:45.040
She should know something.

00:01:45.799 --> 00:01:46.680
Indeed.

00:01:47.640 --> 00:01:50.640
You mean the daughter of that Tang Bingchen?

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:51.200
Yes.

00:01:51.599 --> 00:01:53.040
They should know each other.

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:56.920
Telegraph room.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.480
Send a telegram to Inoue Kamakura.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:03.239
Tell him to mind his own business.

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:04.959
That colonel...

00:02:04.959 --> 00:02:07.519
...is carrying a letter in His Majesty's own handwriting.

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:09.280
A person like that...

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.560
...is best left alone.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.560
Do you hear me?

00:02:15.039 --> 00:02:19.479
Has my father replied?

00:02:19.479 --> 00:02:20.639
Yes.

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:22.599
What did he say?

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.879
Mr. Inoue Akira says that Imperial Investigator...

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:28.479
...is carrying a letter in His Majesty's own handwriting.

00:02:28.479 --> 00:02:33.439
A person like that is best left alone.

00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:12.000
You can't do this.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.199
Are you really sanding the propeller with sandpaper?

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.439
You want to try my job?

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:19.240
I work three shifts a day.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.800
And there are hundreds of planes waiting for repair.

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:22.439
Getting yours fixed now...

00:03:22.439 --> 00:03:23.439
...is your lucky day.

00:03:23.439 --> 00:03:24.240
Sir.

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:24.639
Sir.

00:03:24.639 --> 00:03:25.800
We mean no offense.

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.919
We've already shown you...

00:03:26.919 --> 00:03:27.759
...General Arnold's orders.

00:03:27.759 --> 00:03:30.039
These planes need to be finished ASAP.

00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:33.599
Can you please stop?

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:34.560
Don't you know...

00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:36.199
...we have to fly across the Pacific?

00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:38.280
If you keep sanding it...

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.919
...salt will make the blade tips warp.

00:03:40.479 --> 00:03:41.639
The Pacific.

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:42.919
Finally, someone tells me...

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.800
...where these things are going.

00:03:45.319 --> 00:03:47.080
That's none of your business.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:48.879
Listen.

00:03:49.759 --> 00:03:52.360
If the commander really wants to do this...

00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:54.280
...maybe I have a good method that suits you.

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.199
Modify these planes.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.120
But for now...

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.560
...my job is...

00:03:59.599 --> 00:04:01.960
...to do these meaningless tasks.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.400
Alright.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.120
Look at the marks you made on the propeller.

00:04:06.919 --> 00:04:08.560
Apply some lubricant and smooth it out.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:09.520
Thank you.

00:04:36.439 --> 00:04:37.240
Boys, wake up!

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.199
We're moving out.

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:46.800
March 28, 1942.

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:48.879
The Doolittle Bomber Squadron...

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:52.000
...transfers to Sacramento for training.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.560
Dr. Ozutsu.

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:17.920
Private Second Class Kainoshin...

00:05:18.959 --> 00:05:21.600
...seems worse than yesterday.

00:05:21.959 --> 00:05:23.160
Would you go check on him?

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.360
Understood.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.480
Tang Ju'er.

00:06:22.519 --> 00:06:24.519
What are you doing?

00:06:32.879 --> 00:06:33.720
Let's go.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.480
We're going to the comfort station.

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.920
Wait, I'll take you there.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:54.040
I heard you've been looking for this book.

00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:56.160
I specifically asked a friend in Shanghai to find it.

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.480
I brought it back, hoping you'd like it.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:01.480
I've been looking for this book.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:03.839
Thank you so much.

00:07:04.959 --> 00:07:06.199
Have you read this book?

00:07:06.759 --> 00:07:07.040
Yes.

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:08.079
What do you think?

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.199
This amazing American author...

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:13.879
...when he wrote this book in 1921...

00:07:13.879 --> 00:07:16.639
...already predicted...

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:18.560
...that Japan would launch a surprise attack...

00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:20.319
...on Pearl Harbor from the north Pacific.

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:21.519
Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto...

00:07:21.519 --> 00:07:22.600
...when he served as a military attaché in the US...

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.800
I think before he made this decision...

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.759
...he must have read this book.

00:07:28.839 --> 00:07:29.639
Colonel.

00:07:30.439 --> 00:07:31.879
I'm convinced.

00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:34.600
You are a man of talent by the Emperor's side.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.519
You've always been able to grasp...

00:07:35.519 --> 00:07:37.480
...the pulse of those admirals' decisions.

00:07:38.959 --> 00:07:41.399
I only have people find books for me after the fact.

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:42.839
That's why I'm only a lieutenant general out here.

00:07:43.199 --> 00:07:44.839
I'm just a colonel right now.

00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:45.920
No, no, no.

00:07:46.079 --> 00:07:47.839
You will become a general.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:49.519
You flatter me.

00:07:50.079 --> 00:07:51.000
By the way.

00:07:51.199 --> 00:07:52.079
Your Excellency, Commander.

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:53.879
There's one more thing I'd like to ask of you.

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.439
What is it?

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.279
This time, under orders...

00:07:58.279 --> 00:08:00.360
...to investigate Admiral Osumi Mineo's crash...

00:08:00.839 --> 00:08:01.759
...I need a unit on the island...

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:03.319
...to assist me.

00:08:04.079 --> 00:08:05.160
The Special Police Brigade...

00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.240
...has very close ties...

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.279
...with the Shanghai garrison.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.319
So they can't be fully trusted.

00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:12.560
Admiral Osumi Mineo was always in the Navy.

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.560
So I hope you...

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.879
...can draw a unit from the Navy...

00:08:15.879 --> 00:08:17.600
...to assist my work.

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.439
The officer's rank need not be too high.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:20.800
But preferably, this unit...

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:22.160
...should avoid having members of the Southern Expansion Faction...

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.199
...or the Northern Expansion Faction.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:25.759
Colonel.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.759
Don't take those guys from the Special Police Brigade...

00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:28.920
...seriously.

00:08:29.439 --> 00:08:31.000
They're just a bunch of guard dogs.

00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.320
They'll bark at anyone who comes in.

00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:34.919
In my Marine Corps...

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:36.519
...there's an anti-aircraft battery.

00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:37.879
Their main task is...

00:08:37.879 --> 00:08:39.480
...to guard the port and airfield.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:42.279
The Chinese army has no air superiority.

00:08:42.279 --> 00:08:43.360
They haven't had much to do.

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:45.799
Apart from leaving personnel on combat-ready duty...

00:08:45.799 --> 00:08:46.279
...you can deploy this unit anytime.

00:08:46.279 --> 00:08:46.960
You can deploy this unit anytime.

00:08:48.159 --> 00:08:48.840
Excellent.

00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.240
Then tomorrow, I'll establish my investigation headquarters...

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.879
...at the anti-aircraft battery.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.519
Let Adjutant Sakamoto arrange your rest first.

00:08:56.519 --> 00:08:57.279
Tomorrow...

00:08:57.279 --> 00:08:58.200
...I'll notify all department heads to hold a welcome banquet...

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.279
...for you at the headquarters.

00:09:00.799 --> 00:09:02.399
The commander of the anti-aircraft battery...

00:09:02.399 --> 00:09:03.159
...is First Lieutenant Akinokawa Ken.

00:09:03.159 --> 00:09:04.320
I'll have him come meet you.

00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:05.320
Thank you.

00:09:22.039 --> 00:09:22.919
Ozaki

00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:25.399
Is the examination finished?

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:26.799
Not yet.

00:09:27.519 --> 00:09:28.240
Come here.

00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:29.039
I need to talk to you.

00:09:30.519 --> 00:09:31.159
Hurry up.

00:09:34.759 --> 00:09:35.799
Bring the medical kit.

00:09:59.399 --> 00:10:01.240
Who did this?

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:10.399
Come here.

00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:12.000
Examine her.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:12.919
Yes.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.080
You didn't use any improper methods, did you?

00:10:31.799 --> 00:10:32.879
I can swear.

00:10:32.879 --> 00:10:34.240
Absolutely not.

00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:36.840
Then why did Ye Degong refuse?

00:10:40.799 --> 00:10:41.440
Sir.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.840
If I may be so bold.

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:46.720
Aren't we being too polite with these people?

00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:51.559
Are you questioning me?

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:54.000
I wouldn't dare.

00:10:55.759 --> 00:10:57.200
Let me tell you again.

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:00.159
The key to rule lies in mind and spirit.

00:11:01.559 --> 00:11:03.440
Not physical torture.

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:06.279
Ye Degong is the clan leader of this island.

00:11:06.879 --> 00:11:08.360
Conquer him,

00:11:08.519 --> 00:11:09.840
and you conquer all of Sanzao Island.

00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:11.720
Understood.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:21.720
What do you think of the Colonel who just arrived?

00:11:25.399 --> 00:11:26.120
Well...

00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:31.799
What I've been fearing has finally happened.

00:11:33.039 --> 00:11:34.440
General, you mean...

00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.240
The incident last year involving Admiral Osumi Mineo's plane crash.

00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:39.440
It caused a huge uproar.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:41.360
It alarmed His Majesty.

00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:42.840
Because Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro stepped down,

00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:46.639
the investigation was shelved for a time.

00:11:47.159 --> 00:11:49.279
I never thought it would be reopened now.

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.600
Could it be...

00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.240
the Colonel is here for this matter?

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:57.399
He not only wants to clarify

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:00.320
the true cause of Admiral Osumi's accident,

00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:01.360
but also to find

00:12:02.159 --> 00:12:04.360
the confidential documents lost in the crash,

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:05.360
which only His Majesty,

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.399
the Prime Minister, and military chiefs possess.

00:12:07.759 --> 00:12:08.600
Is the General worried this matter

00:12:09.679 --> 00:12:10.360
might implicate

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.279
officers from our 6th Air Base?

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:15.720
You know as well as I do,

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.279
the Navy and Army are constantly feuding.

00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:20.559
Admiral Osumi

00:12:20.559 --> 00:12:22.320
had already narrowly escaped several assassinations.

00:12:23.639 --> 00:12:24.879
Why this time

00:12:24.879 --> 00:12:26.120
did it have to happen in my jurisdiction?

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.159
Sir,

00:12:28.919 --> 00:12:30.679
don't worry too much.

00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.279
It might just be an accident.

00:12:34.039 --> 00:12:35.279
Unrelated to us.

00:12:37.639 --> 00:12:38.919
We can't rule out that those

00:12:38.919 --> 00:12:40.639
hot-headed radicals under our command did it.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.320
If the Colonel finds out it's connected to us,

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.559
and the blame falls,

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.679
I'll become the target of all criticism.

00:12:48.159 --> 00:12:49.200
Our 6th Air Base

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:50.360
won't know peace again either.

00:12:55.159 --> 00:12:58.279
While we assist the Colonel's investigation,

00:12:58.919 --> 00:13:00.960
we must also gather necessary intelligence.

00:13:02.039 --> 00:13:03.519
During his time on this island,

00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.039
we must be doubly careful.

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:07.519
Yes.

00:13:16.399 --> 00:13:17.679
This is where the doctor sits.

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:19.240
You sit.

00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:25.840
You sit.

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:31.879
Hold on tight.

00:13:35.879 --> 00:13:36.600
Hold on!

00:13:58.440 --> 00:13:59.159
Biying.

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:01.679
Biying.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.039
Ye...

00:14:06.519 --> 00:14:07.000
Hello.

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:08.360
My name is Takeki Ichiro.

00:14:08.519 --> 00:14:10.120
Pleased to meet you.

00:14:10.799 --> 00:14:12.399
I've come to bring Biying her luggage.

00:14:13.399 --> 00:14:13.919
Well then,

00:14:14.679 --> 00:14:15.720
please come in.

00:14:30.399 --> 00:14:31.120
Yingying.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.120
What are you doing here?

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.159
I'm bringing your luggage back.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:36.360
I just calmed my father down.

00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.080
Why are you causing trouble?

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:38.879
Who is it?

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:41.080
Master.

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:41.960
You have to come with me.

00:14:42.399 --> 00:14:43.159
Hurry, go.

00:14:43.159 --> 00:14:43.480
Go, go.

00:14:46.799 --> 00:14:47.440
Mr. Ye.

00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.320
What are you doing here?

00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.159
I'm returning Biying's luggage.

00:14:54.879 --> 00:14:55.399
Put it there.

00:14:56.200 --> 00:14:56.600
Go back.

00:14:57.399 --> 00:14:57.919
Mr. Ye,

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.799
I apologize for alarming you today.

00:15:01.639 --> 00:15:02.039
I'm sorry.

00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.720
Your country's soldiers always act this way.

00:15:05.159 --> 00:15:06.679
Completely disregarding justice and morality.

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:07.759
Crude.

00:15:08.519 --> 00:15:08.960
Reckless.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.240
Mr. Ye is right.

00:15:11.039 --> 00:15:12.200
Some soldiers do act

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:13.480
in a crude and reckless manner.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:15.200
I am also very angry about it.

00:15:16.519 --> 00:15:17.519
I heard that you, Mr. Ye,

00:15:17.519 --> 00:15:18.919
previously served as a consul to America.

00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.399
You must be well-versed in diplomatic affairs

00:15:21.759 --> 00:15:22.799
and erudite.

00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:24.799
I hope to have the chance to learn from you.

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:28.200
Auntie Four.

00:15:28.960 --> 00:15:29.399
See the guest out.

00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:30.840
Mr. Ye.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:32.080
I don't want to know who you are.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:34.559
Our family wants nothing to do

00:15:34.559 --> 00:15:35.799
with a Japanese man in uniform.

00:15:35.879 --> 00:15:36.840
Nothing at all.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.559
Stop pestering my daughter.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:39.639
Go back.

00:15:40.559 --> 00:15:41.279
But I need to take

00:15:41.279 --> 00:15:42.080
Ye Biying out to take care of something.

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:42.759
Go back.

00:15:43.159 --> 00:15:43.639
Takeki Ichiro.

00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:44.720
Hurry up and go.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.720
I'm not leaving.

00:15:49.679 --> 00:15:50.159
Father.

00:15:50.879 --> 00:15:51.360
How about this.

00:15:51.879 --> 00:15:52.679
I'll see him out.

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:53.759
I'll be back soon.

00:15:54.320 --> 00:15:54.720
Let's go.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:55.919
Ying'er.

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.000
Father.

00:15:58.159 --> 00:15:59.000
I'll be back very soon.

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:00.039
Rest well.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:02.320
Ying'er.

00:16:05.559 --> 00:16:06.639
Are you trying to get me killed?

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.120
Nurse Tang.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:04.319
What's wrong?

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.359
You're all flustered.

00:17:06.519 --> 00:17:07.880
N-no, nothing.

00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:10.240
Did something happen at the hospital?

00:17:16.480 --> 00:17:20.039
I went to the comfort station for a routine check today.

00:17:21.359 --> 00:17:23.000
I saw Huihui.

00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:24.559
Dad.

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.119
Can't you think of a way?

00:17:26.839 --> 00:17:27.799
Maybe we could...

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:28.759
...rescue Huihui.

00:17:28.759 --> 00:17:29.279
You...

00:17:29.599 --> 00:17:30.160
Stop right there.

00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:32.039
Don't even think about it.

00:17:32.319 --> 00:17:33.920
You didn't see how miserable she was.

00:17:34.839 --> 00:17:35.480
Ju'er.

00:17:36.119 --> 00:17:37.599
We can't get involved in this.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.240
And you can't handle it either.

00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:42.480
If you ask me,

00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:44.920
it's her dad and her brother's fault.

00:17:45.519 --> 00:17:46.960
Why did they have to...

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.519
...attack Japanese soldiers for no reason?

00:17:48.759 --> 00:17:49.960
Whose world is this?

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:51.240
It's the Japanese world.

00:17:51.599 --> 00:17:52.720
If the Japanese don't punish her,

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:53.440
who will they punish?

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:56.880
Ju'er.

00:17:57.839 --> 00:17:59.920
Your dad works for the Japanese now.

00:18:00.279 --> 00:18:01.240
Why?

00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:02.640
Isn't it for our family...

00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.319
...to live safely...

00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.200
...and securely?

00:18:08.119 --> 00:18:10.359
You should understand your father's good intentions.

00:18:13.079 --> 00:18:13.440
Alright.

00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:14.680
Dad, dinner's ready.

00:18:15.279 --> 00:18:15.720
Let's eat.

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.480
I'm going out.

00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:19.640
Where are you going?

00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:20.759
I'll be back soon.

00:18:25.240 --> 00:18:27.599
Takeki must verify clearly...

00:18:27.599 --> 00:18:30.160
...all of Ye Biying's situation...

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.720
...within the Special Police Brigade.

00:18:31.720 --> 00:18:33.920
Find out what the island's special police...

00:18:33.920 --> 00:18:35.759
...actually know.

00:18:35.759 --> 00:18:38.440
And make an accurate judgment for the next step.

00:18:38.759 --> 00:18:40.319
Today was truly an unlucky day.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.119
Originally, I planned...

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:43.279
...that my first task upon arriving...

00:18:43.279 --> 00:18:44.279
...would be to go all out...

00:18:44.720 --> 00:18:46.839
...to build good relations with the Special Police Brigade.

00:18:46.839 --> 00:18:47.880
After all, the island's security...

00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:49.000
...is their responsibility.

00:18:50.559 --> 00:18:51.880
Without them knowing...

00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:53.640
...it would be easier for us to find...

00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:55.319
...and rescue the American pilot.

00:18:56.799 --> 00:18:57.759
But after this commotion today,

00:18:58.559 --> 00:18:59.039
they must have already...

00:18:59.039 --> 00:19:00.559
...marked me as their number one enemy.

00:19:01.799 --> 00:19:03.079
A low-key island arrival...

00:19:03.400 --> 00:19:04.599
...has turned into a high-profile rescue.

00:19:17.119 --> 00:19:18.119
Don't just keep walking.

00:19:18.839 --> 00:19:19.359
Tell me.

00:19:19.359 --> 00:19:20.319
Today at the Special Police Brigade,

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:21.960
what did they ask you?

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.160
What did you answer?

00:19:23.839 --> 00:19:25.640
Tell me every detail you can remember.

00:19:28.119 --> 00:19:29.920
Do you have to ask me this now?

00:19:31.319 --> 00:19:33.000
My mind is a mess right now.

00:19:33.559 --> 00:19:35.400
I get scared just thinking about it.

00:19:35.680 --> 00:19:36.480
If you don't tell me,

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:37.880
I have no way to assess...

00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:39.039
...the danger we're facing now.

00:19:39.559 --> 00:19:40.039
Do you have any idea...

00:19:40.039 --> 00:19:41.599
...how I spent my entire day today?

00:19:41.759 --> 00:19:43.200
I was finally overjoyed...

00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:44.200
...thinking I could go home.

00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:45.839
As soon as I boarded the ship, I encountered a torpedo.

00:19:45.839 --> 00:19:46.799
Encountered a firefight.

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.240
I almost died at sea.

00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:49.039
Do you know that?

00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:50.720
I was fished out...

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:52.640
...and taken straight to the police brigade.

00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:53.279
Interrogated.

00:19:53.839 --> 00:19:54.960
And I even dragged my father into it.

00:19:55.920 --> 00:19:56.960
I finally got out.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.160
People along the way saw me dressed like a ghost.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.400
They pointed and whispered at me.

00:20:00.759 --> 00:20:02.079
Even my father doesn't understand me.

00:20:02.759 --> 00:20:03.920
And all of this is because of you.

00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:04.680
Takeki Ichiro.

00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.000
Someone's coming.

00:20:34.039 --> 00:20:34.839
Stop playing.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:35.920
Go back.

00:20:36.640 --> 00:20:37.599
All of you, go back.

00:20:37.599 --> 00:20:38.240
Stop playing.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:40.400
Let's go.

00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:41.960
Hurry up.

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.359
Don't go.

00:20:49.319 --> 00:20:49.559
Ke Wen.

00:20:49.559 --> 00:20:51.079
Don't go.

00:20:51.079 --> 00:20:51.920
Ke Wen.

00:20:53.599 --> 00:20:54.599
It's me.

00:20:55.599 --> 00:20:56.519
Biying.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.400
Ying'er.

00:21:01.839 --> 00:21:02.960
You're back.

00:21:06.519 --> 00:21:07.279
How did you...

00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:09.519
...become like this?

00:21:11.839 --> 00:21:12.799
The sun.

00:21:13.559 --> 00:21:14.440
The sun.

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:16.079
Chase the sun.

00:21:16.920 --> 00:21:17.559
Where are you going?

00:21:17.559 --> 00:21:18.279
The sun.

00:21:18.279 --> 00:21:19.079
Where are you going?

00:21:19.319 --> 00:21:19.799
Ke Wen.

00:21:19.799 --> 00:21:20.640
Chase the sun.

00:21:21.559 --> 00:21:21.960
Ke Wen.

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:22.839
Chase the sun.

00:21:23.960 --> 00:21:24.720
Ke Wen.

00:21:26.599 --> 00:21:27.319
Ke Wen.

00:21:27.759 --> 00:21:28.680
Chase the sun.

00:21:29.359 --> 00:21:29.640
Ke Wen.

00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:30.319
Chase the sun.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:32.400
Chase the sun.

00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:34.880
Sun, sun.

00:21:40.079 --> 00:21:41.839
I want the sun.

00:21:41.839 --> 00:21:42.240
Go.

00:21:43.440 --> 00:21:44.160
No.

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.319
Ju'er

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.519
Sorry I'm late.

00:21:56.519 --> 00:21:56.920
Why are you so late?

00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.359
Today is the day for the routine check at the comfort station.

00:21:59.359 --> 00:21:59.640
And...

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:00.200
The medicine?

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:01.519
Medicine.

00:22:02.799 --> 00:22:04.039
Is that all you care about, the medicine?

00:22:06.519 --> 00:22:06.880
Here.

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:09.599
Alright, I'm going now.

00:22:09.599 --> 00:22:10.680
You're leaving already?

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:13.240
What is it? Is there something else?

00:22:14.359 --> 00:22:15.319
Is this bit of medicine...

00:22:16.359 --> 00:22:17.400
more important than me?

00:22:18.559 --> 00:22:19.039
No.

00:22:20.039 --> 00:22:21.039
You're hiding something from me.

00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:22.640
I'm not.

00:22:24.599 --> 00:22:26.039
Japanese soldiers came to my house today.

00:22:26.039 --> 00:22:27.559
They turned the whole place upside down.

00:22:27.559 --> 00:22:28.960
My father was so angry he fell ill.

00:22:29.039 --> 00:22:30.200
Your father fell ill from anger...

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.960
so why are you so happy?

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.279
Ying'er is back.

00:22:35.839 --> 00:22:36.799
Ying'er is back.

00:22:38.279 --> 00:22:39.039
I can't say any more.

00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:39.799
I'm not good with words.

00:22:40.720 --> 00:22:42.000
I'll tell you when I figure it out.

00:22:42.079 --> 00:22:42.680
I have to go.

00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:43.240
Be careful.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.000
Tang Ju'er.

00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.799
I've been waiting for you.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:34.880
You weren't on the island an hour...

00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:37.400
before both your guns were taken.

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:39.039
Your experience as an agent...

00:23:39.039 --> 00:23:40.200
is quite legendary.

00:23:42.119 --> 00:23:42.559
Keep them safe.

00:23:42.559 --> 00:23:43.440
Don't lose them again.

00:23:58.400 --> 00:24:00.240
Let me go! Let me go!

00:24:00.240 --> 00:24:01.160
What are you doing?

00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:02.400
What are you doing?

00:24:02.400 --> 00:24:03.400
Let me go!

00:24:05.839 --> 00:24:07.039
Don't come any closer!

00:24:07.039 --> 00:24:08.359
Don't come any closer!

00:24:12.599 --> 00:24:14.240
Let me go!

00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.000
Listen to me.

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:15.960
Let me go!

00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:17.240
I really like you.

00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:18.079
Let me go!

00:24:18.559 --> 00:24:19.480
Stop running.

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.160
Let me go!

00:24:29.279 --> 00:24:31.000
Let me go!

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.599
Let me go!

00:24:32.599 --> 00:24:33.640
Stay here. Don't move.

00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.240
I have work to do.

00:24:38.119 --> 00:24:39.440
Let me go!

00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:41.279
Let me go!

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.720
As a soldier of the Empire...

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.119
I am truly ashamed of you.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.359
Colonel.

00:25:04.799 --> 00:25:06.000
To be honest with you...

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:08.279
I am currently on a mission.

00:25:09.519 --> 00:25:10.319
What mission?

00:25:10.799 --> 00:25:11.400
The mission of pinning a woman...

00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:12.839
beneath you?

00:25:26.759 --> 00:25:28.000
Do you know that under my authority...

00:25:28.319 --> 00:25:30.200
I could shoot you right now?

00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:38.799
Colonel.

00:25:39.799 --> 00:25:40.960
Take him back to the Police Brigade.

00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:41.720
Lock him up.

00:25:42.359 --> 00:25:43.359
I'll be there shortly.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.400
Yes, sir.

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:47.960
Yes, sir.

00:25:49.359 --> 00:25:50.200
Move!

00:25:50.559 --> 00:25:51.559
I can walk myself.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.839
I'm sorry.

00:26:00.559 --> 00:26:01.640
What happened?

00:26:06.079 --> 00:26:06.680
Ju'er.

00:26:06.839 --> 00:26:07.319
Ju'er.

00:26:08.319 --> 00:26:09.119
Ju'er.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:10.680
Ying'er.

00:26:11.319 --> 00:26:12.599
Ying'er.

00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:21.920
It's alright now.

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:25.839
It's alright now.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:26.839
It's alright now.

00:26:33.519 --> 00:26:34.400
Stop holding onto me.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:41.000
That guy ruined my fun.

00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:44.240
Just let me ride the bike alone.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:47.640
Captain, wait.

00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.119
I need to talk to Takeki.

00:27:09.839 --> 00:27:10.640
I'll be right back.

00:27:22.319 --> 00:27:23.279
What's that woman's name?

00:27:25.039 --> 00:27:26.000
Tang Ju'er.

00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.559
How much does she know about you?

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:31.720
We grew up together.

00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:33.720
We studied together in Guangzhou.

00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:36.039
Does she know you went to Yan'an?

00:27:38.079 --> 00:27:38.559
Yes.

00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.559
Inoue Kamakura is after you.

00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.599
He's investigating your social connections.

00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:47.680
Tell me in detail...

00:27:48.039 --> 00:27:49.000
about your time at school.

00:27:50.759 --> 00:27:52.839
Back when I was at the women's normal school in Guangzhou...

00:27:53.079 --> 00:27:54.599
she was at the nursing school in Guangzhou.

00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.519
We spent a lot of time together.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.559
But later I went to Yan'an...

00:27:58.559 --> 00:27:59.440
and then to Chongqing.

00:28:00.079 --> 00:28:01.039
We lost contact.

00:28:01.880 --> 00:28:03.319
If the Special Police Brigade on the island...

00:28:03.799 --> 00:28:05.400
finds out you once went to Yan'an...

00:28:06.039 --> 00:28:07.039
such an important lead...

00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.160
they will not let it go.

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:10.319
If they follow the trail...

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.319
we won't be far from exposure.

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:14.680
What should we do then?

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:21.480
Find a way to plug this leak.

00:28:21.759 --> 00:28:22.880
You're not thinking of silencing her, are you?

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.160
I will if necessary.

00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:27.400
Unless...

00:28:29.039 --> 00:28:29.920
You go and tell her...

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.240
that you never went to Yan'an at all.

00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:33.920
You've been in Shanghai all these years.

00:28:34.559 --> 00:28:35.279
Make her believe it.

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.039
Can you do that?

00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:39.799
Yes.

00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:41.599
Who else knows about this?

00:28:44.400 --> 00:28:46.359
My father and Longxia.

00:28:47.599 --> 00:28:49.039
You're not going to silence them too, are you?

00:28:49.039 --> 00:28:49.640
Takeki Ichiro.

00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:50.559
Go talk to her now.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:03.599
Ju'er

00:29:04.079 --> 00:29:05.119
What's wrong with Ying'er?

00:29:06.519 --> 00:29:08.200
What did that Japanese man say?

00:29:09.759 --> 00:29:10.240
I

00:29:12.559 --> 00:29:13.279
We

00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:16.119
After we parted in Guangzhou back then,

00:29:16.759 --> 00:29:17.920
I was originally going to Yan'an.

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.599
But later,

00:29:21.119 --> 00:29:22.960
I didn't make it. There was fighting everywhere.

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:24.720
So I ended up in Shanghai.

00:29:24.759 --> 00:29:26.200
You didn't go to Yan'an?

00:29:26.599 --> 00:29:27.480
I didn't go to Yan'an.

00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:30.519
In Shanghai,

00:29:31.480 --> 00:29:32.880
I had to make a living in Shanghai.

00:29:33.480 --> 00:29:34.440
I had no choice.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.480
So I went to a dance hall.

00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:37.599
That's where I met him.

00:29:38.319 --> 00:29:39.039
Ying'er.

00:29:39.319 --> 00:29:40.039
Don't tell me you...

00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.559
You must never tell my family about this.

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:45.440
Never say a word.

00:29:47.279 --> 00:29:48.240
This time,

00:29:48.240 --> 00:29:50.880
it's because Takeki had a mission on Sanzao Island.

00:29:51.519 --> 00:29:53.119
He knew I was also from Sanzao Island,

00:29:53.119 --> 00:29:54.319
so he brought me back.

00:29:59.359 --> 00:30:00.519
Anyway,

00:30:02.359 --> 00:30:03.839
thank you for saving me.

00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:07.240
That Inoue Kamakura

00:30:08.119 --> 00:30:10.160
is a very powerful man on this island.

00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:11.960
You must be careful of him.

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.240
I know.

00:30:13.799 --> 00:30:15.440
He was the one who arrested me when I arrived on the island.

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:16.920
He was also the one who interrogated me.

00:30:18.839 --> 00:30:20.039
That Inoue Kamakura

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:24.279
is the worst of the worst.

00:30:24.799 --> 00:30:25.839
It's okay now.

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:31.240
Ju'er.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:33.880
One more thing.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:36.519
From now on,

00:30:36.799 --> 00:30:38.839
if anyone asks about me,

00:30:39.839 --> 00:30:40.720
say you don't know.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:43.920
Okay?

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.400
It's very important.

00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:50.279
What I'm saying now is very important.

00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:51.039
You must promise me.

00:31:11.759 --> 00:31:12.480
Don't cry now.

00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:13.240
Don't cry.

00:31:27.799 --> 00:31:28.920
Sasaki.

00:31:31.599 --> 00:31:33.319
This is my turf.

00:31:33.519 --> 00:31:36.839
In front of my dear subordinates,

00:31:36.839 --> 00:31:38.839
you pointed a gun at my head. Jerk!

00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.400
Fifteen years.

00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.759
No one has dared to be so disrespectful to me.

00:31:43.400 --> 00:31:45.000
And all for a Chinese woman.

00:31:45.319 --> 00:31:46.319
You've noticed it too.

00:31:48.279 --> 00:31:52.359
I won't let this go.

00:32:10.519 --> 00:32:12.039
Remember what I told you today?

00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.079
Uncle Tang.

00:32:19.079 --> 00:32:19.359
Young Mistress.

00:32:19.759 --> 00:32:20.759
I heard you were back.

00:32:22.319 --> 00:32:23.359
Who's that?

00:32:29.079 --> 00:32:29.759
What's wrong with Ju'er?

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:30.880
Don't ask.

00:32:31.079 --> 00:32:32.160
Go check on her quickly.

00:32:32.759 --> 00:32:33.200
Alright, alright.

00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:34.799
Ju'er.

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:44.680
Ju'er.

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:47.400
Ju'er.

00:32:48.799 --> 00:32:49.640
What's going on?

00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:50.759
What happened?

00:32:52.319 --> 00:32:53.519
Did someone bully you?

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:55.440
Was it Longxia who bullied you?

00:32:57.359 --> 00:32:57.880
No.

00:32:58.119 --> 00:32:59.720
Could it be a Japanese person who bullied you?

00:33:05.839 --> 00:33:07.200
A Japanese person?

00:33:09.279 --> 00:33:10.440
Which Japanese person?

00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.680
Dares to bully our family?

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.440
Tell me who it is.

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:15.960
I'll go find Captain Inoue.

00:33:16.119 --> 00:33:17.319
I'll have him give us justice.

00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:28.000
What's all this about?

00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:28.799
You...

00:33:32.119 --> 00:33:34.000
You're going to worry me to death.

00:33:40.799 --> 00:33:42.039
The one who bullied your daughter

00:33:44.519 --> 00:33:46.240
is that Captain Inoue.

00:34:09.239 --> 00:34:09.840
Let's stop here.

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:13.239
Alright.

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:14.599
Then I'll leave you here.

00:34:15.039 --> 00:34:16.320
It's a good chance for me to go to the Police Brigade again.

00:34:17.119 --> 00:34:18.440
What are you going to the Police Brigade for?

00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:20.280
You don't quite understand the Japanese character.

00:34:21.079 --> 00:34:22.880
They are all trained to face failure.

00:34:23.079 --> 00:34:24.239
So regarding a matter,

00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:25.480
they absolutely will not give up easily.

00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:28.400
So what will you do?

00:34:28.559 --> 00:34:29.320
What I can do

00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:30.480
is to start the investigation

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.159
into Osumi Mineo's plane crash as soon as possible.

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.199
To bring you into my work system

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:35.119
and clear your suspicion.

00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:37.639
Starting tomorrow,

00:34:38.519 --> 00:34:39.800
you need to start making visits as soon as possible.

00:34:40.119 --> 00:34:41.239
Try to get some information about the courier

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:42.760
from the villagers.

00:34:43.559 --> 00:34:44.199
I know that.

00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:46.199
The Special Police Brigade

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:48.039
doesn't dare to investigate me openly.

00:34:48.639 --> 00:34:49.760
But their investigation of you,

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.239
even though we disrupted it today,

00:34:51.559 --> 00:34:52.760
they still won't give up.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:54.199
So you must be very careful.

00:34:54.679 --> 00:34:55.760
Then what should we do?

00:34:56.039 --> 00:34:57.280
Right now, I'll go to the Police Brigade

00:34:57.480 --> 00:34:58.639
to put some pressure on them.

00:34:59.039 --> 00:35:00.280
I hope that under heavy pressure,

00:35:00.519 --> 00:35:01.599
they will postpone their investigation of you.

00:35:03.320 --> 00:35:03.920
But if they

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:05.079
keep focusing on Tang Ju'er,

00:35:06.039 --> 00:35:06.599
for us,

00:35:06.599 --> 00:35:07.400
that is the most dangerous sign.

00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:08.639
I've instructed her.

00:35:09.400 --> 00:35:10.159
She won't talk.

00:35:10.599 --> 00:35:11.239
Let's hope so.

00:35:13.199 --> 00:35:14.239
After you go back today,

00:35:15.360 --> 00:35:16.719
have a good talk with your father.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.679
Try to ease the tension with him.

00:35:19.159 --> 00:35:21.159
We need a stable home front.

00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.039
So that we can

00:35:22.039 --> 00:35:23.639
find the courier's whereabouts faster.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:25.880
I know.

00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:26.760
Go on.

00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:28.199
I'll come pick you up tomorrow.

00:35:55.039 --> 00:35:55.760
Here, Major.

00:35:56.679 --> 00:35:57.440
Have something to eat.

00:36:01.639 --> 00:36:03.559
There was a lot of commotion outside during the day.

00:36:05.239 --> 00:36:06.920
It seems we can't stay here long.

00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:15.280
I've already sent word of your presence here

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:16.559
to Macau, China.

00:36:17.320 --> 00:36:19.320
They will try to contact the Nationalist Government

00:36:19.920 --> 00:36:20.920
and send someone as soon as possible.

00:36:22.239 --> 00:36:22.760
Good.

00:36:24.119 --> 00:36:26.119
It's just that there's a troublesome matter now.

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.360
My daughter has returned.

00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.840
Your daughter returns at this time

00:36:37.239 --> 00:36:39.159
Could it be related to the Nationalist government?

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:40.079
She...

00:36:41.320 --> 00:36:43.199
She couldn't possibly have dealings with them.

00:36:44.760 --> 00:36:46.400
The trouble is...

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.639
She came back with a Japanese officer.

00:36:50.519 --> 00:36:51.519
A Japanese officer?

00:36:55.119 --> 00:36:56.360
That is quite troublesome.

00:36:59.679 --> 00:37:00.239
Alright.

00:37:00.679 --> 00:37:01.760
I will handle this.

00:37:03.079 --> 00:37:03.880
You rest well.

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:04.800
Have something to eat.

00:37:05.679 --> 00:37:06.280
Okay.

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.039
Okay.

00:37:20.719 --> 00:37:21.199
Auntie.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.639
Is Father still angry with me?

00:37:24.559 --> 00:37:26.000
It's just temporary.

00:37:26.159 --> 00:37:27.199
It'll be fine.

00:37:28.239 --> 00:37:28.639
Auntie.

00:37:30.079 --> 00:37:31.559
I bought a gift for Father.

00:37:32.039 --> 00:37:32.360
That's good.

00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:33.480
Should I give it to him later,

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.599
or wait until tomorrow?

00:37:35.559 --> 00:37:36.159
How about this?

00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:37.440
You give it to him for me later.

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:39.320
You should give it yourself.

00:37:39.679 --> 00:37:40.159
I'm afraid he's angry with...

00:37:40.159 --> 00:37:40.760
Ying'er.

00:37:41.159 --> 00:37:41.639
Come here.

00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.199
It's fine. Go on.

00:37:51.519 --> 00:37:52.079
Father.

00:38:00.360 --> 00:38:01.880
Auntie Four, have a seat.

00:38:11.519 --> 00:38:13.239
Do you think you deserve to sit?

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.719
The whole family is here today.

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:28.199
So, in front of everyone,

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:29.079
make it clear.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:31.320
What is your relationship

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:32.800
with that Japanese officer?

00:38:35.239 --> 00:38:36.119
Takeki...

00:38:38.719 --> 00:38:39.719
He is a good man.

00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:40.519
Takeki...

00:38:40.519 --> 00:38:42.320
I don't care if he's good or bad.

00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.360
I just want you to tell me

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.559
how you met him,

00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:45.840
how long you've known him,

00:38:45.920 --> 00:38:47.320
and how far things have gone.

00:38:47.599 --> 00:38:49.039
It's not what you think between us.

00:38:49.159 --> 00:38:49.719
Yingying.

00:38:50.480 --> 00:38:52.000
Speak properly to the master.

00:38:52.679 --> 00:38:53.880
Don't make him angry.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.400
Weren't you in the north seeking your ideals,

00:38:56.639 --> 00:38:57.840
your ideology?

00:38:58.559 --> 00:39:00.239
How did you get mixed up with that Japanese man?

00:39:01.599 --> 00:39:03.599
And what about that gun?

00:39:06.079 --> 00:39:06.559
Father...

00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:08.960
Your daughter was wronged

00:39:09.679 --> 00:39:11.559
by the Japanese police this morning.

00:39:12.679 --> 00:39:13.880
Could you please not interrogate me

00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:15.199
like they did?

00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:17.159
Dad...

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:18.480
Ying'er just returned today

00:39:18.639 --> 00:39:20.199
and was wronged by the police brigade.

00:39:20.199 --> 00:39:21.360
Why not let her rest a bit

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:22.039
and talk tomorrow?

00:39:22.159 --> 00:39:22.760
You shut up!

00:39:23.679 --> 00:39:24.880
Your sister's actions today

00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.199
have shamed our entire family.

00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:27.719
They've plunged our family into

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.239
a state of public scorn and condemnation.

00:39:29.440 --> 00:39:30.480
And you still defend her?

00:39:31.559 --> 00:39:32.079
Sit down!

00:39:35.519 --> 00:39:36.920
All information about this person

00:39:37.679 --> 00:39:38.880
is top secret.

00:39:39.559 --> 00:39:40.400
I swore an oath.

00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:41.800
Regarding him,

00:39:42.760 --> 00:39:43.880
I will not say a single word.

00:39:45.480 --> 00:39:46.239
Will you talk or not?

00:39:47.159 --> 00:39:47.480
Yingying...

00:39:48.119 --> 00:39:49.159
Um, Yingying...

00:39:49.440 --> 00:39:51.440
Didn't you buy a gift for the master?

00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:53.239
Quick, take it out.

00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:54.880
Take it out quickly.

00:39:55.280 --> 00:39:56.280
Give it to the master.

00:39:59.119 --> 00:40:00.559
Master, don't be angry.

00:40:00.559 --> 00:40:00.880
Look,

00:40:00.880 --> 00:40:02.639
Yingying even bought you a gift.

00:40:02.639 --> 00:40:03.159
See?

00:40:04.519 --> 00:40:05.880
Quick, give it to the master.

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:07.880
Father...

00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:10.079
This is for you.

00:40:14.079 --> 00:40:15.079
Are you going to talk or not?

00:40:16.039 --> 00:40:17.280
If you don't explain clearly,

00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:18.480
then get out of this house!

00:40:22.719 --> 00:40:23.800
Fine, I'll leave then!

00:40:30.760 --> 00:40:31.519
Go.

00:40:31.519 --> 00:40:32.480
Go after your sister.

00:40:32.599 --> 00:40:33.960
Don't let her go find that Japanese man.

00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:37.199
Auntie Four, you go too.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:38.880
If she refuses to come back,

00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:40.440
let her stay at your place for the night.

00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:41.719
Keep her company.

00:40:42.119 --> 00:40:42.280
Alright.

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:42.920
Go quickly, go.

00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:43.519
Okay.

00:41:44.119 --> 00:41:45.280
Father is so furious.

00:41:46.360 --> 00:41:47.239
What do we do?

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.320
You have no idea.

00:41:53.320 --> 00:41:54.639
In the years you were gone,

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:55.880
these Japanese devils came to the island

00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.480
and committed countless atrocities.

00:41:58.519 --> 00:42:01.239
Later, Uncle wanted Father and me to go to Macau, China,

00:42:01.599 --> 00:42:02.639
but Father absolutely refused.

00:42:04.599 --> 00:42:05.440
Look at you.

00:42:05.679 --> 00:42:06.639
Today, actually...

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.960
Father isn't saying these things because he's mad at you.

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.280
He's furious at the Japanese devils.

00:42:10.599 --> 00:42:11.360
And you,

00:42:11.400 --> 00:42:12.760
you even brought one home.

00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:13.960
How could he not be angry?

00:42:14.800 --> 00:42:16.159
I didn't want to either.

00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:17.800
I had no choice.

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:19.800
We have to be together.

00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:27.199
What are you doing?
