00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.640
(Episode 12)

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:19.760
CEO Chae.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:24.360
Congratulations.

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:26.430
Oh my goodness.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:29.430
Why is the brat who broke the guitar here?

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.040
Thank you all for coming.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:33.810
But...

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:35.470
This is my son.

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.480
Say hello. She's the CEO of this hotel.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:40.850
Yes, hello. We've actually met before.

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.450
You're right.

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.150
You did look a little familiar.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:48.520
You're the lawyer
who came with that aspiring singer.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.420
Yes, I'm Kang Baek Ho.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.760
Excuse me, but...

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:57.800
I'm Ma Seo Rin.
I'm the Director of Food and Beverage.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:02.070
- Professor, let's go greet the Chairman.
- Yes.

00:01:08.570 --> 00:01:11.140
You sure are full of surprises.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:12.980
Excuse me?

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:17.420
- Are you refusing to shake my hand?
- A handshake? The nerve.

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:22.020
You're a rare breed.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.590
What? Now you're playing dumb?
You acted like you were penniless.

00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.090
You were desperately trying
to haggle down the price.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:31.700
What? You're the Director of Food
and Beverage of Dream Hotel?

00:01:31.700 --> 00:01:34.070
What are you talking about? Haggle what?

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:35.430
Hey!

00:01:36.430 --> 00:01:40.370
What kind of new tactic is this?
Is this some new way of flirting?

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:42.070
You're still going to play dumb?

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.940
Give me the 3,000 dollars
for my guitar now.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:48.450
I was going to give you a huge discount
since you seemed to be struggling,

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.880
or even let it slide completely
if you were genuinely remorseful.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.420
But now, absolutely not!
No way I'm doing that anymore.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:55.190
Cough up the 3,000 dollars.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.220
Unbelievable.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.760
Did seeing a pretty girl like me
make you lose your mind?

00:02:01.990 --> 00:02:04.500
How can you be so fluent
in spouting such nonsense?

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.400
Fine. I'm warning you.

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.500
If you don't pay 3,000 dollars
by tomorrow,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.940
I'm filing a lawsuit. You've been warned.

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:12.500
Hey, wait a minute!

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:16.810
Don't "wait a minute" me. I warned you.

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.450
What is that guy's deal?
What's gotten into him?

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:35.030
Right.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.130
- Alright, then.
- Yes.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.300
Yes.

00:02:39.130 --> 00:02:42.270
For each of these guests...

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.080
Our Chairman was talking...

00:02:53.710 --> 00:02:55.150
I’ll see you from time to time.

00:02:56.450 --> 00:02:58.550
Please come to visit our hotel often.

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.890
Our Chairman has worked very hard.

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.260
Dad, stop staring with heart eyes.

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:07.490
You punk.

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:11.260
So you can't look away from a pretty woman
either, right?

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:12.700
I just realized it.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:17.170
You think you're any different?
All men are the same.

00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.670
I'm your son, after all.

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:21.070
So of course I am.

00:03:22.870 --> 00:03:23.880
By the way,

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.280
Ah Young is here. Haven't you seen her?

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.280
- Ah Young's here?
- Yes.

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:31.580
I barely managed to shake her off.
Now this is going to be a pain.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:35.320
She's your mom's friend's daughter.
Try not to be so cold to her.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:40.290
Dad, that's why I let her drag me around.
I really can't do it anymore.

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:44.200
Dad.

00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:49.070
Hey, son.

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:50.800
God bless you.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.610
- What?
- What are you doing here?

00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.440
We meet again here.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.550
What do you mean by that?
That should be my line.

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.380
And when did you have time
to change your clothes?

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.080
You weren't wearing your glasses earlier.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.790
- What, did you change into a disguise?
- What are you talking about?

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.760
Can't you see I'm working part-time
to pay you back for your guitar?

00:04:16.260 --> 00:04:18.000
Then who was that woman I just saw?

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:20.200
- Was she a ghost?
- What are you talking about?

00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.670
Get out of my way. I'm trying to work.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.170
- Wait...
- Baek Ho!

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.900
What?

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:28.340
Baek Ho!

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:33.180
- Hi.
- You didn't mean we're done, did you?

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:36.150
How could you leave me on read
and just blow me off?

00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:39.320
- Are you serious?
- Look, I already told you.

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.620
I see you as a little sister,
not a girlfriend.

00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:46.260
- I'm really busy.
- What are you doing?

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:49.460
Please, just help me out here.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:51.800
- Just play along.
- What?

00:04:53.230 --> 00:04:54.230
I see.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:57.500
You got a girlfriend, didn't you?
Is that what this is?

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:00.940
That's right! I have a girlfriend!

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:04.240
- You didn't know?
- Who is she? Who?

00:05:05.510 --> 00:05:07.610
I don't believe it! I don't believe you.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.680
- Excuse me?
- Please, just help me out.

00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:14.550
With what? How am I supposed to help?

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:16.350
You don't believe me?

00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:18.560
My girlfriend is right here.

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.030
- What? Wait. What are you even saying?
- Come here, honey.

00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.510
You're so mean. How could you?
Right in front of me?

00:05:40.750 --> 00:05:43.210
I'm never talking to you again!

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:50.150
What do you think you're doing?

00:05:52.420 --> 00:05:53.420
Sorry.

00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:55.330
Are you hurt?

00:05:58.430 --> 00:05:59.600
What was that all about?

00:06:00.670 --> 00:06:01.800
I'm sorry.

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:05.970
You're bleeding.
You should get that treated right away.

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:10.040
What was that for?
Can't you see this is all broken?

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.780
I was in the middle of working!

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.360
(Emergency Room)

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.410
Never in my life...

00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:46.180
have I had a day like this.
Do you even realize what you did to me?

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:49.210
- I'm sorry.
- That was sexual harassment,

00:06:49.380 --> 00:06:51.780
obstruction of business,
and causing injury.

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.320
I'm really sorry.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:55.990
I'll make it all up to you.

00:06:56.550 --> 00:06:58.720
And you don't have to pay me back
for the guitar.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.460
And how exactly are you going to
make it up to me?

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.860
Getting me fired from my job is one thing.

00:07:03.530 --> 00:07:04.860
Do you know what my dream is?

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:06.900
Of course not.

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:10.030
How am I supposed to know
what your dream is?

00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:11.270
Then listen up.

00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.710
I'm going to tell you just how much
you've ruined for me.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.880
Go on.

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.880
- I'm ready for whatever you have to say.
- To join Chang Restaurant,

00:07:22.380 --> 00:07:24.820
learn as an apprentice
under Chef Kang Jun Ho,

00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.650
and become a three-star Michelin chef.
That was my dream.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:28.650
But...

00:07:28.820 --> 00:07:31.520
now that I've been fired
from even that part-time hotel job,

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.530
how can I ever show my face
at that restaurant again?

00:07:36.190 --> 00:07:38.500
So that was your dream.

00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.200
Does my dream seem that pathetic to you?

00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:45.300
- No, I mean...
- It might not seem like...

00:07:45.300 --> 00:07:47.240
a big deal to you,

00:07:47.710 --> 00:07:51.640
but do you have any idea
how hard I've worked for it?

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.450
For someone in my family's situation,
a dream like that is a luxury,

00:07:57.180 --> 00:07:58.180
but I...

00:07:59.150 --> 00:08:00.750
I wanted to make it come true
more than anything.

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:19.270
Thanks.

00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:26.180
- Right?
- By the way, I appreciate that.

00:08:26.340 --> 00:08:28.350
- Congratulations.
- You're looking well.

00:08:28.410 --> 00:08:29.410
Thank you.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:36.890
Alright.

00:08:50.570 --> 00:08:52.400
Thank you to all our guests...

00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:55.010
for joining the reopening party
of the Dream Hotel.

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.780
Our hotel, long rooted in tradition,

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.880
has been renewed
to unveil a brand-new space...

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:02.850
and an elevated level of service.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.890
And now, to kick off this occasion,
let's hear from our CEO, Chae Hwa Young.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.750
Please give her a big round of applause.

00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.200
(Dream Hotel Reopening Ceremony)

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:34.910
Good evening, esteemed guests.

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.180
Thank you all so much...

00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.620
for attending our hotel's
grand reopening ceremony.

00:09:41.420 --> 00:09:44.090
(Dream Hotel Reopening Ceremony)

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.540
The transformation our hotel has undergone
these past few months...

00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:06.210
is more than just a physical renovation.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:09.710
It represents the beginning
of our vision...

00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:13.620
for the future we are building
for our guests.

00:10:14.250 --> 00:10:16.690
Father. Please let me marry Dong Seok.

00:10:16.750 --> 00:10:19.390
Who are you calling "Father?"

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.290
No! Give me my baby back!

00:10:22.290 --> 00:10:23.560
You can't do this!

00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:25.460
I said she's my baby now!

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.470
Oh, my sweet girl.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.400
It feels like my Dong Seok
has come back to me.

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.070
For sustainable business operations,

00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:35.370
we've incorporated eco-friendly materials
and technology.

00:11:03.370 --> 00:11:04.640
To get to this point,

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:08.110
however, our hotel has faced
its share of ups and downs.

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:10.470
Looking back,

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:13.140
the past 30-some years...

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:15.850
just flash before my eyes.

00:11:16.380 --> 00:11:18.650
You've been through so much.

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.950
Move into the house tomorrow with Seo Rin.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.290
Into the house?

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:27.430
If you're Seo Rin's mother,
then you're my daughter-in-law.

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:32.200
Dong Seok.

00:11:32.830 --> 00:11:34.470
You're alive, aren't you?

00:11:35.900 --> 00:11:38.170
Look how much your daughter has grown.

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:40.600
My son...

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:44.510
If you're out there somewhere,
please come home.

00:11:45.740 --> 00:11:47.510
As we stand here, newly renovated,

00:11:47.780 --> 00:11:50.920
and take this first step
with a renewed spirit,

00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:53.980
I hope this hotel becomes
more than just a place to stay,

00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:59.520
but a space where our guests
can create their most cherished memories.

00:12:00.460 --> 00:12:03.890
We hope you will look forward
to the innovations yet to come.

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:06.030
Thank you.

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.830
(Dream Hotel Reopening Ceremony)

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:34.460
Great work, everyone.

00:12:35.390 --> 00:12:36.730
You did a great job too, Seo Rin.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.830
Father, you must be tired.
Would you like some honey tea?

00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:43.000
No, you go on and get some rest.

00:12:43.630 --> 00:12:44.640
Okay.

00:12:56.780 --> 00:12:57.980
Seo Rin, we need to talk.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:01.390
About what?

00:13:01.450 --> 00:13:04.460
I saw you earlier.
You seemed smitten with Chef Kang.

00:13:04.720 --> 00:13:07.060
- You really like him?
- Yes.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:08.290
I don't approve.

00:13:09.930 --> 00:13:14.100
And why not?
Who I like is none of your business, Mom.

00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:16.300
- Seo Rin.
- I'm sure you know...

00:13:16.300 --> 00:13:18.140
I'm not going to listen to you.

00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.310
So don't waste your breath, Mom.
I like Chef Kang,

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:25.940
and I plan on falling in love with him.

00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.110
You know I don't approve of him,

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:31.080
so you're doing this on purpose,
aren't you?

00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:32.480
Mom, you hate Chef Kang?

00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.020
Why?

00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:36.520
Chef Kang's one of Jin Hong Ju's people.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.960
Jin Hong Ju was instrumental
in recruiting him.

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:41.190
They knew each other
from when they studied in the US.

00:13:42.990 --> 00:13:45.160
Is that how you judge people, Mom?

00:13:45.560 --> 00:13:49.130
And you're saying I can't like Chef Kang
just because of that?

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.440
- That's unbelievably petty.
- Mark my words.

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:57.840
He's too dangerous to open your heart to.
You must stay away from him.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:01.080
I'm going to marry Chef Kang.

00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:04.620
Stop being so childish.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.850
You don't really feel that way.

00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:09.320
It'll fizzle out
just as quickly as it flared up.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:10.890
Just you wait and see.

00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:20.800
It doesn't take long to fall for someone.

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:23.430
"Love at first sight."

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:25.570
That exists for a reason.

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:30.840
I won't make you pay for the broken drink,

00:14:31.010 --> 00:14:33.640
so just get out. Now!

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:36.150
Of all the rotten luck.

00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:44.260
Come here, honey.

00:14:55.930 --> 00:14:57.670
I've never been so humiliated.

00:14:59.270 --> 00:15:00.340
I'm so upset.

00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.520
What are you doing here?

00:15:13.150 --> 00:15:14.420
So sexually harassing me wasn't enough?

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:17.090
Are you stalking me now?

00:15:17.090 --> 00:15:18.590
No, it's not what you think.

00:15:19.590 --> 00:15:22.430
I felt so terrible, so I wanted to come
and apologize properly.

00:15:25.100 --> 00:15:26.100
Please, take this.

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.340
Here, for the guitar.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.240
Come on, what is this?
I told you that you didn't have to.

00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:38.580
Thanks to you,
I got fired from my job today,

00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.750
- so I deducted that amount.
- How am I supposed to take this?

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:44.420
- I can't take this.
- Just take it.

00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:48.950
Take the money,
and let's just never see each other again.

00:15:49.290 --> 00:15:50.550
Let's just be done with each other.

00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:54.360
Fine.

00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:58.600
Okay, but this is for the trouble
I caused you, so please take it.

00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:00.360
It'll make me feel better, too.

00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:05.540
Hey, listen. You don't care about
how awful I feel about all this,

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:07.740
and you're just doing this
to clear your own conscience?

00:16:07.810 --> 00:16:09.710
- No, that's not it.
- Whatever.

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:12.740
I was going to chalk it up to bad luck
and not press charges,

00:16:13.140 --> 00:16:15.550
but your attitude
is so completely out of line...

00:16:15.950 --> 00:16:17.150
that I've decided
to press charges after all.

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:19.750
And what are you going to charge me with?

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:25.890
Like I said. Sexual harassment,
obstruction of business,

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:27.790
causing injury, and...

00:16:28.630 --> 00:16:29.930
crushing my dreams.

00:16:31.700 --> 00:16:33.300
That last one's not a real crime.

00:16:34.100 --> 00:16:35.130
Whatever.

00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:38.270
I know a very good lawyer.

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:39.770
I'm going to talk to the lawyer,

00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:43.670
and I'll make sure you end up
in handcuffs, so just you wait.

00:16:43.770 --> 00:16:45.780
And don't even think about trying
to buy my silence with this.

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:51.820
I've apologized to you
sincerely over and over,

00:16:52.720 --> 00:16:54.120
but if that's really how you feel,

00:16:55.420 --> 00:16:56.590
I'll just have to accept the consequences.

00:16:58.060 --> 00:17:00.420
I am truly sorry.

00:17:18.940 --> 00:17:22.480
Are you kidding me? These hands are meant
for a guitar, not trimming vegetables.

00:17:22.580 --> 00:17:26.220
It makes perfect sense,
so stop whining and get to it.

00:17:27.450 --> 00:17:29.850
Bok Gil, Tae Pyung, look.

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:31.560
Suk Hee's doing a good job!

00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.290
Yes, my dear Suk Hee,
you're doing a great job.

00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:37.160
What about me?
Aren't I doing a good job, Dad?

00:17:37.490 --> 00:17:39.500
Hey! Can't you see
how well your mom is doing it?

00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:43.200
Exactly. Since I'm so bad at this,
I should probably just stop, right?

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:44.400
Sit down.

00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.940
Don't you try to get clever with me.

00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:50.510
- I'm home.
- You're back?

00:17:50.510 --> 00:17:51.510
You're home.

00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:56.810
Jang Mi's hand hurts.
My daughter hurt her hand.

00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:58.450
My poor daughter's hand is hurt.

00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:04.990
Mom, I'm okay. It's not that bad.
I'm fine.

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:09.030
Where did you get hurt? Is it bad?

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:24.780
What do you think you're doing?

00:18:26.740 --> 00:18:27.740
Sorry.

00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.110
Are you hurt?

00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.620
What was that all about?

00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.780
Why is everyone acting like this?
Am I talking to a brick wall?

00:19:07.150 --> 00:19:09.020
- What? What did you say?
- What's wrong?

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:11.760
Honestly, you're all acting so strange.

00:19:13.860 --> 00:19:16.630
So, how was the party today, Jun Ho?

00:19:16.890 --> 00:19:17.900
Fine.

00:19:18.630 --> 00:19:19.760
Why? What's going on?

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:24.500
I kind of hurt someone.

00:19:26.140 --> 00:19:27.140
Mom.

00:19:27.400 --> 00:19:29.610
Because of your friend's daughter,
Ah Young,

00:19:29.610 --> 00:19:31.040
everything went wrong today.

00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:33.440
- How so?
- I've spoiled her since we were kids...

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.780
because she's your friend's daughter,

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:36.910
and now she's completely obsessed with me.

00:19:37.250 --> 00:19:38.780
Seriously, you have no idea what I did
to shake her off.

00:19:40.420 --> 00:19:41.420
Jun Ho.

00:19:41.850 --> 00:19:44.320
I have a favor to ask.
Can you help me out?

00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:45.860
What is it?

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:49.160
There's this woman whose dream
is to learn as an apprentice under you...

00:19:49.230 --> 00:19:50.590
and become a three-star Michelin chef.

00:19:51.130 --> 00:19:54.530
The thing is,
I accidentally injured her hand.

00:19:54.930 --> 00:19:56.970
- So?
- What do you mean?

00:19:57.270 --> 00:19:59.900
I'm asking you to hire her
at your restaurant.

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:02.970
- I don't just hire anyone.
- You can't ask for a favor like that.

00:20:03.410 --> 00:20:06.480
Don't you know Jun Ho is meticulous
when it comes to his kitchen?

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.880
- She can start with grunt work.
- You said her hand's injured.

00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:12.320
Once it's healed.

00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:16.790
What? Who's the jerk?
A guy like that needs to learn his lesson.

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:19.790
Right. He's a bad person.

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:23.090
He gave our Jang Mi a boo-boo.
He's so mean.

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.530
I'm not just going to let it go.

00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:28.630
Did you get it checked at the hospital?
Did you take any medicine for it?

00:20:28.970 --> 00:20:30.270
Don't worry, Dad.

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:33.240
Tae Pyung,
you have a lawyer friend, right?

00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:35.170
I need to get some legal advice
right away.

00:20:35.440 --> 00:20:37.340
Sure. I'll call him and put you on.

00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:42.510
Baek Ho?

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:44.950
Hang on,
I'm putting my sister, Jang Mi, on.

00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:53.760
Hello?

00:20:54.220 --> 00:20:58.060
Hello, this is Oh Jang Mi,
Tae Pyung's sister.

00:20:58.200 --> 00:21:00.500
Jang Mi. It's nice to hear from you.

00:21:00.630 --> 00:21:05.170
I hope I'm not disturbing you
by calling so late.

00:21:05.370 --> 00:21:09.470
Not at all.
For me, this is broad daylight.

00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:13.910
That's a relief.

00:21:14.210 --> 00:21:18.020
Actually, I was hoping
to ask you for some advice.

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:19.880
Of course, ask me anything.

00:21:19.880 --> 00:21:22.050
But don’t be too sharp with it.

00:21:24.790 --> 00:21:27.060
You're pretty good with the dad jokes
for a lawyer.

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:31.900
What did you want to ask me about?

00:21:32.130 --> 00:21:34.230
You see, some lunatic...

00:21:34.230 --> 00:21:36.000
I mean, some disrespectful jerk...

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:37.200
No, I mean...

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:40.900
this guy pushed me,

00:21:40.970 --> 00:21:43.910
- and I got hurt when I fell.
- That's terrible.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:47.440
What kind of lunatic would dare
to hurt the lovely Ms. Jang Mi?

00:21:47.540 --> 00:21:49.480
A guy like that should be thrown in jail.

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:53.050
- We can get him thrown in jail, can't we?
- Absolutely.

00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.320
But what's the extent of your injuries?

00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:59.420
"Injury" might be too strong a word.
It's pretty minor.

00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:02.090
But I was cut by glass, and I did bleed.

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:04.830
Anyway, more than the injury itself,

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:07.160
I'm just really offended and upset.

00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:08.470
Did you get a medical report?

00:22:08.570 --> 00:22:11.230
No, it's not nearly serious enough
for that.

00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:14.300
I guess jail time
is out of the question, right?

00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.840
I'd have to meet with you in person
to get the full details.

00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.980
I just want that jerk to...

00:22:20.380 --> 00:22:24.950
I just want a sincere apology from him.

00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:28.520
- I think that would be enough.
- In that case,

00:22:29.250 --> 00:22:31.250
I'll accompany you when you go
to meet this scoundrel.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:36.360
Oh my gosh, really?
But you must be so busy.

00:22:36.430 --> 00:22:39.960
However busy I am, how could I not
do that much for Tae Pyung's sister?

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:41.830
I'm more than happy to do it.

00:22:41.930 --> 00:22:44.900
Thank you so much. I'm really touched.

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:46.740
It's nothing to be touched over.

00:22:47.300 --> 00:22:48.640
I'm the one who should be thanking you.

00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:52.740
Okay, goodbye then.

00:22:58.180 --> 00:22:59.280
It went well?

00:22:59.650 --> 00:23:01.790
Thanks. I feel so much better now.

00:23:02.390 --> 00:23:05.360
I never knew having a lawyer for a friend
could be this useful.

00:23:06.060 --> 00:23:07.990
We've got someone powerful in our corner.

00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:32.780
Jung Suk Hee.

00:23:33.220 --> 00:23:35.750
- How did you find me here?
- You evil witch.

00:23:36.790 --> 00:23:38.260
You stole my daughter,

00:23:38.860 --> 00:23:42.190
and you've been able to sleep soundly
all these years?

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:45.260
Does your father-in-law...

00:23:46.030 --> 00:23:47.660
even know about this?

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:50.330
- What do you think you're doing?
- What do I think I'm doing?

00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.640
You're the one who's been totally fooled
by me all this time.

00:23:56.040 --> 00:23:59.580
Did you take me for some kind of fool
who doesn't know anything?

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:02.880
You're dead wrong.

00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:07.350
I'm just biding my time.
I'm waiting until you're at the very top.

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:10.890
I'm waiting for that exact moment
to bring you crashing down.

00:24:11.490 --> 00:24:12.920
- Shut up!
- Just you wait.

00:24:13.490 --> 00:24:17.030
I'm going to expose
everything you've done to the world...

00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:19.430
and completely ruin you.

00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:24.840
Until that day,
I'll keep playing the fool.

00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:29.610
Just like you fooled everyone else,

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:33.240
you're the one being fooled by me.

00:24:35.410 --> 00:24:38.050
All for that one day.

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:40.820
Let go of me! Let me go!

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:43.050
Let go!

00:24:43.820 --> 00:24:44.860
Let go!

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:56.970
Right, maybe Jung Suk Hee...

00:24:58.370 --> 00:24:59.900
isn't a fool after all.

00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:04.170
She might be fooling everyone
and just biding her time.

00:25:10.050 --> 00:25:11.720
I can't just let her be.

00:25:17.450 --> 00:25:21.020
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:25:45.180 --> 00:25:47.550
She looks perfectly normal
just standing there.

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:50.420
Has she really regressed to the mental age
of a five-year-old?

00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:52.120
Or...

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:54.790
Oh, hello.

00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:02.300
Suk Hee?

00:26:02.370 --> 00:26:06.340
Bok Gil! I cleaned up. I did a good job.

00:26:06.940 --> 00:26:08.270
I like Bok Gil.

00:26:08.570 --> 00:26:12.810
Look at you, Suk Hee.
You did such a great job tidying up.

00:26:13.580 --> 00:26:14.780
Ta-da!

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:19.250
So she really has regressed.

00:26:19.750 --> 00:26:21.220
She really is a simpleton.

00:26:23.350 --> 00:26:25.820
I'm so sorry. Are you ready to check out?

00:26:25.990 --> 00:26:27.220
- Yes.
- Okay.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.900
All right, that will be 18 dollars.

00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.580
We take bank transfers
and mobile pay as well.

00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.610
Yes, thank you, and here you are.

00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:58.620
Yes, here you are.

00:26:59.020 --> 00:27:01.190
- Thanks.
- I'm sorry.

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:02.530
I'm sorry.

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:04.430
The banner has been removed.

00:27:04.490 --> 00:27:06.030
(The banner has been removed.)

00:27:13.800 --> 00:27:16.240
Looks like you reported an illegal banner.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:21.240
It was blocking a traffic light
and was a hazard.

00:27:21.410 --> 00:27:23.010
- So...
- I can see that.

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:28.120
But it could've been put up
by someone really in need.

00:27:30.290 --> 00:27:34.620
Actually, we put up a banner ourselves.

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:37.430
- You put one up?
- Yes.

00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:41.560
Here are the chopsticks. Take these.

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:47.170
I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have kept you
talking about all that.

00:27:47.570 --> 00:27:48.640
Please come again.

00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:50.040
Come again!

00:27:50.410 --> 00:27:51.410
Okay.

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:55.880
Hello.

00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:58.780
What do you mean the banner's gone?

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:03.320
You think someone reported it
and had it removed?

00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:28.010
(The First Man)

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.810
Let's have a drink

00:28:30.810 --> 00:28:31.880
Just copy me, Tae Pyung.

00:28:31.950 --> 00:28:33.480
Tonight

00:28:33.480 --> 00:28:35.120
No cheesy old songs!

00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:37.750
Has Dad not come back yet?
Is he having an affair or something?

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:40.690
Your father would never cheat on me.

00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:42.560
You never invite us over to your place.

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.960
I'll invite you over
and treat you to a huge feast.

00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:48.200
I wonder what Lawyer Kang looks like.

00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:54.100
