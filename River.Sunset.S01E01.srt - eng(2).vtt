00:01:54.159 --> 00:01:57.200
March 9, 1942

00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.359
A mysterious Believer

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:01.959
is flown by special plane to the China Theater.

00:02:02.599 --> 00:02:03.439
"Believer"

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:06.079
is a special term in the US military

00:02:06.079 --> 00:02:09.360
meaning a person who holds the highest secrets.

00:02:14.639 --> 00:02:16.960
You must, before April 18th,

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.919
reach Quzhou Airport in China.

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:21.919
There, you will receive the Tokyo bombing force.

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:25.879
We have no choice but to risk sending you.

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:26.759
The radio beacon you carry

00:02:26.759 --> 00:02:28.879
must not be captured by the Japanese.

00:02:29.639 --> 00:02:31.400
This operation concerns

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.680
the survival of our Pacific forces.

00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.120
Sam,

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.319
this is Curtis.

00:02:36.319 --> 00:02:37.879
Kate will arrive at Yang Base

00:02:37.879 --> 00:02:39.080
within ten minutes.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.360
Repeat:

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.639
Kate will arrive at Yang Base within ten minutes.

00:02:42.639 --> 00:02:43.919
Over.

00:02:47.199 --> 00:02:47.879
Curtis,

00:02:47.879 --> 00:02:48.680
this is Sam.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.319
Roger.

00:02:49.319 --> 00:02:49.719
Repeat:

00:02:49.719 --> 00:02:50.240
Roger.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:50.879
Over.

00:02:54.319 --> 00:02:54.800
Sir,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.039
Curtis is estimated to arrive

00:02:56.039 --> 00:02:57.360
at the Burma airport in ten minutes.

00:02:58.120 --> 00:02:59.240
Maintain contact.

00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:00.159
Yes, sir.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.680
Whiskey,

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.599
this is Curtis 663

00:03:10.599 --> 00:03:12.439
requesting communication, over.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.439
Curtis,

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:15.400
this is Whiskey, over.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.599
This is Curtis.

00:03:17.599 --> 00:03:18.560
Requesting landing.

00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.759
Repeat, requesting landing, over.

00:03:21.919 --> 00:03:24.039
Curtis,

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.360
cleared to land, over.

00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:27.360
Repeat:

00:03:28.479 --> 00:03:30.840
Cleared to land, over.

00:03:32.319 --> 00:03:33.800
These Brits

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:36.840
are so hot they can't even speak straight.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.959
Intercept that plane!

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:45.920
Intercept it!

00:04:55.319 --> 00:04:58.480
Pull up, pull up! Go around!

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.199
Shoot it down!

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.319
Pull up!

00:05:32.439 --> 00:05:33.879
Pull up!

00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.279
Sam, this is Curtis 663.

00:05:48.279 --> 00:05:49.639
Yang Base has fallen.

00:05:49.639 --> 00:05:51.319
Repeat, Yang Base has fallen.

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:52.240
Diverting to Mike Point, code for Mandalay Airport.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.079
Diverting to Mike Point.

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:53.439
Out.

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:54.399
How could there be

00:05:54.399 --> 00:05:55.399
darn it Japanese there?

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:58.040
Contact was normal just minutes ago.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.360
Keep trying to contact them.

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.839
Keep an eye on that plane.

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:04.800
Major,

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:07.720
we've lost navigation.

00:06:10.079 --> 00:06:12.319
Can we make it to the alternate airport?

00:06:12.879 --> 00:06:15.439
We can only reduce altitude

00:06:15.439 --> 00:06:17.680
and look for ground markers.

00:06:19.959 --> 00:06:20.800
Stay alert.

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.680
Report our position to Sam at all times.

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:30.399
In fact,

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:33.079
the plane was not without major problems.

00:06:33.079 --> 00:06:35.199
The bullet that hit the instrument panel

00:06:35.199 --> 00:06:37.199
caused the plane's compass to fail

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:38.480
and the airspeed indicator to read low.

00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:40.639
When Witt Chen and the others thought

00:06:40.639 --> 00:06:43.399
they were heading north to Mandalay,

00:06:43.399 --> 00:06:46.360
they were actually flying northeast.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.399
Mike,

00:06:47.399 --> 00:06:49.439
this is Curtis 663, requesting communication,

00:06:49.439 --> 00:06:50.000
over.

00:06:52.319 --> 00:06:53.240
Mike,

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.199
this is Curtis 663, requesting communication,

00:06:55.199 --> 00:06:55.839
over.

00:07:05.519 --> 00:07:06.600
Sam,

00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:08.920
this is Curtis 663, requesting communication,

00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:09.240
over.

00:07:09.480 --> 00:07:11.639
This is Sam, go ahead, over.

00:07:11.639 --> 00:07:12.680
I have reached the vicinity of Mike Point

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.800
but cannot establish contact.

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:23.040
Why are they shooting at us?

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.560
What's going on?

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:26.800
They probably mistook us

00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.240
for a Japanese plane.

00:07:30.319 --> 00:07:32.160
Curtis is under fire.

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.160
Repeat:

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.519
Curtis is under fire.

00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:37.199
Notify Mandalay Airport:

00:07:37.639 --> 00:07:39.040
Curtis is approaching.

00:07:39.199 --> 00:07:40.240
Do not fire.

00:07:41.439 --> 00:07:42.560
Mike,

00:07:42.560 --> 00:07:43.480
this is Sam.

00:07:43.480 --> 00:07:44.519
Cease fire.

00:07:44.519 --> 00:07:47.360
Repeat, cease fire.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:55.319
Mike,

00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:56.439
Cease fire!

00:07:56.439 --> 00:07:58.120
We are on approach.

00:07:58.639 --> 00:07:59.079
Sir,

00:07:59.079 --> 00:08:00.600
Mandalay Airport says

00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:01.959
they see no approaching aircraft.

00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:02.439
The anti-aircraft units

00:08:02.439 --> 00:08:05.000
are also not firing at any targets.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:07.319
Where on earth have they flown to?

00:08:07.639 --> 00:08:09.120
This is not our position.

00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.040
This is not Mike Mandalay Airport.

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.839
Get away from there.

00:08:15.079 --> 00:08:16.600
Leave now, immediately.

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:18.800
Repeat, leave immediately.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.639
You must abandon the plane immediately.

00:08:24.399 --> 00:08:25.879
Put on your parachutes.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.600
You have to jump.

00:08:27.759 --> 00:08:28.959
Protect yourself and complete the mission.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.639
Curtis,

00:08:36.639 --> 00:08:38.480
this is Sam, respond if you receive.

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.440
Curtis,

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.080
this is Sam, respond if you receive.

00:08:42.440 --> 00:08:44.080
Colonel, we still can't reach them.

00:08:44.279 --> 00:08:45.879
Contact Army Air Forces Headquarters.

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.720
We must report to General Arnold immediately.

00:08:47.720 --> 00:08:48.480
Yes, sir.

00:08:48.519 --> 00:08:49.480
What was the last reported position

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:50.200
of the aircraft?

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.600
The last coordinates were

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:54.799
Longitude 113 degrees, Latitude 28 degrees.

00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.200
Order the monitoring department

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.080
to closely monitor, 24/7,

00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.279
radio communications in this area.

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.039
Yes, sir.

00:09:08.399 --> 00:09:10.360
Yes, play it slower.

00:09:15.759 --> 00:09:18.799
Around 0300 hours, March 10, Showa 17

00:09:18.799 --> 00:09:20.960
The 6th Air Base anti-aircraft unit

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.919
shot down one US military transport plane.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.080
Two pilots were killed,

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.480
and one navigator.

00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:27.919
Special Report

00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:32.879
Sir

00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:34.399
We intercepted a radio message.

00:09:34.399 --> 00:09:35.919
From the Japanese 6th Air Base.

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:38.600
Sent to the command in Taiwan, China.

00:09:39.039 --> 00:09:40.399
Where is this base located?

00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:42.759
In the Pearl River Delta region of China.

00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:50.440
Mobilize resources to decrypt it immediately. The faster, the better.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.720
We are ordered to, within twenty-four hours,

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.159
ascertain the aircraft's whereabouts.

00:09:54.399 --> 00:09:56.200
Notify General Stilwell.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:57.960
Request assistance from the China Theater.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:59.279
Request assistance from the China Theater.

00:09:59.279 --> 00:10:00.039
Yes, sir.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.200
Who is it?

00:10:18.679 --> 00:10:19.960
Generalissimo, it's me.

00:10:20.279 --> 00:10:21.559
A 4A-level encrypted telegram

00:10:21.559 --> 00:10:23.000
from the Burma Expeditionary Force.

00:10:23.519 --> 00:10:25.720
Sent by the Expeditionary Force's special signals unit.

00:10:26.240 --> 00:10:28.039
Signed by General Stilwell.

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:33.519
Generalissimo.

00:10:38.679 --> 00:10:40.440
Rangoon Airport has fallen.

00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.799
The Believer's plane failed to land.

00:10:42.799 --> 00:10:44.480
Diverted to an alternate airfield.

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.360
Missing at longitude 113 degrees east,

00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:48.399
latitude 22 degrees north.

00:10:48.399 --> 00:10:50.720
The Believer is missing.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.320
Dai Li.

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:57.399
An American plane is missing.

00:10:57.399 --> 00:10:58.399
Look into it.

00:10:59.320 --> 00:11:02.080
Yes.

00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.639
Understood, Chancellor.

00:11:03.639 --> 00:11:05.159
I will dispatch investigators immediately.

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.159
Salute.

00:11:15.159 --> 00:11:16.000
Chief.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000
Salute.

00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.240
Chief.

00:11:23.559 --> 00:11:24.440
Chief.

00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.840
Chief.

00:11:34.559 --> 00:11:35.080
Director.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:35.759
I'm back.

00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:38.759
Another sleepless night?

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:42.919
Director.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:45.360
What's the urgent matter?

00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.360
An American military aircraft

00:11:49.639 --> 00:11:51.600
has gone missing near the Pearl River Estuary.

00:11:53.679 --> 00:11:55.279
The Old Man gave us twenty-four hours.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.799
We must locate it.

00:11:58.159 --> 00:11:59.679
Determine the plane's

00:11:59.679 --> 00:12:01.759
and its crew's whereabouts.

00:13:11.519 --> 00:13:13.240
Attention.

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:16.279
At ease.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.600
My name is Doolittle.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:22.240
Welcome, everyone.

00:13:23.840 --> 00:13:25.080
Over the next few weeks,

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.360
we will undergo extensive training.

00:13:28.399 --> 00:13:29.639
On the aircraft.

00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.039
I know you are the best pilots.

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:36.919
You are our pride.

00:13:38.879 --> 00:13:41.039
I hope you won't let me down.

00:13:42.639 --> 00:13:43.080
Colonel.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:43.519
Can you give us an overview

00:13:43.519 --> 00:13:44.399
of the mission?

00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:47.879
No, at least not now.

00:13:49.279 --> 00:13:50.559
I can only tell you

00:13:51.799 --> 00:13:54.080
this mission is very dangerous.

00:13:55.399 --> 00:13:56.919
The choice is yours.

00:13:57.440 --> 00:13:59.120
You can choose to back out now.

00:14:00.399 --> 00:14:01.840
No one will think less of you.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.559
No one will think less of you.

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:09.840
I only want the best pilots.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:12.120
Those who make the nation proud.

00:14:16.919 --> 00:14:20.480
There's nothing we can't accomplish.

00:14:23.279 --> 00:14:24.559
Training begins now.

00:14:42.679 --> 00:14:43.799
What is it?

00:14:43.799 --> 00:14:45.080
Sir, there's a small problem.

00:14:45.799 --> 00:14:46.320
What happened?

00:14:46.320 --> 00:14:48.320
Witt Chen, who was to meet you in China, is missing.

00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:50.559
What?

00:14:51.519 --> 00:14:53.200
Rangoon Airport is occupied by the Japanese.

00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.440
Rangoon Airport is occupied by the Japanese.

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:56.039
Witt's plane was shot down.

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:58.360
Does the plan still proceed?

00:14:59.679 --> 00:15:00.240
Until we receive

00:15:00.240 --> 00:15:01.440
an order from President Roosevelt to stop,

00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:02.879
everything continues as planned.

00:15:04.639 --> 00:15:08.279
So we're lambs to the slaughter.

00:15:08.279 --> 00:15:08.840
No.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:10.399
At least not yet.

00:15:11.279 --> 00:15:13.519
Intelligence is handling this.

00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.440
The General just wants you to focus on training.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.799
Who does the General want to lead this team?

00:15:20.799 --> 00:15:21.600
I don't know.

00:15:22.279 --> 00:15:23.879
Why did you take this assignment?

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.559
Can you help me?

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:29.120
You need to discuss that with him.

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.759
Friend.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:46.360
Chief.

00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:48.960
Telegram from US Army Air Corps Intelligence.

00:15:57.360 --> 00:15:58.200
This decodes to a Japanese military telegram.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:15:59.440
This decodes to a Japanese military telegram.

00:16:01.799 --> 00:16:03.679
I'll check the archives for info on this location.

00:16:03.679 --> 00:16:05.039
You brief the Director first.

00:16:13.240 --> 00:16:13.679
Report.

00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:19.159
American intelligence

00:16:19.399 --> 00:16:20.320
intercepted a message from the Japanese 6th Air Base.

00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:21.440
intercepted a message from the Japanese 6th Air Base.

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:22.320
Sent to the command in Taiwan, China.

00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:23.320
Sent to the command in Taiwan, China.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:25.600
It confirms that several hours ago,

00:16:25.960 --> 00:16:28.320
over Sanzao Island, Zhongshan County, Guangdong,

00:16:28.879 --> 00:16:29.799
Japanese garrison forces shot down an Allied plane.

00:16:29.799 --> 00:16:30.960
Japanese garrison forces shot down an Allied plane.

00:16:31.519 --> 00:16:32.759
Two pilots killed.

00:16:32.759 --> 00:16:33.840
One navigator killed.

00:16:34.799 --> 00:16:36.279
Sanzao Island.

00:16:42.039 --> 00:16:43.440
The telegram only states

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:45.639
the pilots and navigator were killed.

00:16:46.039 --> 00:16:48.360
No word on the fourth person on the plane?

00:16:49.919 --> 00:16:51.279
No news on the fourth person.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:55.240
Does Chief Shen know?

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.320
Chief Shen knows.

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:58.240
He's already gone to the archives

00:16:58.679 --> 00:17:00.639
to look up detailed information on Sanzao Island.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:05.960
Contact the Fourth War Zone.

00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:07.559
Use all available resources.

00:17:07.559 --> 00:17:09.799
We must uncover the details

00:17:09.799 --> 00:17:10.759
of this aircraft.

00:17:11.559 --> 00:17:14.240
We must find the fourth person's whereabouts.

00:17:15.279 --> 00:17:15.799
Yes.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:28.240
An'er

00:17:30.799 --> 00:17:32.160
Last night

00:17:32.519 --> 00:17:34.079
Our anti-aircraft artillery unit

00:17:34.279 --> 00:17:36.279
shot down an American plane.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:39.880
Yet,

00:17:40.640 --> 00:17:41.720
he dared to salvage items from the plane

00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:43.359
without authorization.

00:17:44.039 --> 00:17:45.000
You're lying!

00:17:45.359 --> 00:17:48.759
My An'er is definitely not a thief!

00:17:49.960 --> 00:17:52.519
I saw him salvaging with my own eyes.

00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:54.359
He was gathering seafood!

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.759
You bandits!

00:17:57.759 --> 00:17:59.000
You won't even let us eat our fill,

00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:00.160
and now you claim

00:18:00.359 --> 00:18:01.200
the things in the sea are yours too?

00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:01.920
That's right.

00:18:02.319 --> 00:18:04.240
Everything in the sea belongs to us.

00:18:06.039 --> 00:18:08.240
Every breath of air you take

00:18:08.240 --> 00:18:09.440
belongs to us.

00:18:09.839 --> 00:18:10.559
I said

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.160
he's a thief,

00:18:12.799 --> 00:18:14.319
so he is a thief.

00:18:14.319 --> 00:18:15.160
You...

00:18:17.279 --> 00:18:18.359
President Tang!

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:19.000
Yes?

00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.920
With an attitude like yours,

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:24.599
you can forget about the ancestor worship today.

00:18:24.599 --> 00:18:28.480
The chief officiant has arrived.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:44.720
Elder Ye.

00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:46.319
Hello.

00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:57.599
This is the ancestral hall,

00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.880
a place for venerating our ancestors.

00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:01.160
Xia'er.

00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:12.279
Present the incense.

00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.599
Invoke the blessings.

00:19:20.079 --> 00:19:23.200
Pour libation, three bows.

00:19:27.640 --> 00:19:30.119
Rise and return to position.

00:19:30.960 --> 00:19:32.160
Clan Elder.

00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:33.160
Proceed.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:35.240
Secondary offering ceremony.

00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:37.079
Before the incense altar,

00:19:37.240 --> 00:19:38.480
kneel.

00:19:58.519 --> 00:20:00.519
The rite is concluded.

00:20:14.640 --> 00:20:15.680
Fellow villagers,

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.400
ancestor worship

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:22.160
serves to order the generations,

00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:24.039
honor merits and virtues,

00:20:25.319 --> 00:20:26.880
respect the elderly and the worthy,

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.559
remember our origins, and unite the clan.

00:20:31.039 --> 00:20:32.119
The ancient kings established these rites

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.680
to honor our roots and teach the people.

00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.599
Without ancestors, where would parents be?

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.839
Without parents, where would we be?

00:20:43.119 --> 00:20:45.759
Thus, ancestor worship teaches us our foundation.

00:20:47.160 --> 00:20:48.799
A person without humanity

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:51.319
is no different from a beast.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:54.440
Wait a minute.

00:20:55.519 --> 00:20:57.680
Don't think I don't understand your words,

00:20:57.759 --> 00:20:58.720
old man.

00:21:00.440 --> 00:21:01.640
It seems these past two years

00:21:02.039 --> 00:21:04.160
you've been living too comfortably.

00:21:05.359 --> 00:21:08.240
Now it's time to remind you

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.279
exactly whose territory this is.

00:21:14.519 --> 00:21:15.359
I declare

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.920
the immediate execution

00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:19.240
of this thief!

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:19.920
Hold on!

00:21:21.599 --> 00:21:22.680
The nation has its laws,

00:21:22.880 --> 00:21:23.880
the clan has its rules.

00:21:25.279 --> 00:21:27.559
Since the judgment is to be held in the ancestral hall,

00:21:28.319 --> 00:21:29.160
then it is only proper

00:21:29.559 --> 00:21:31.079
for the people of Sanzao Island to handle it.

00:21:33.279 --> 00:21:33.759
Fine.

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:36.640
How do you propose to handle it?

00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:42.000
Long Xia.

00:21:43.039 --> 00:21:43.640
Clan discipline.

00:21:56.039 --> 00:21:57.039
Your hand.

00:21:59.519 --> 00:22:01.160
I didn't!

00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.880
I really didn't!

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:04.160
Your hand!

00:22:49.799 --> 00:22:51.279
Elder Ye,

00:22:51.880 --> 00:22:53.000
your clan discipline

00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.599
is far too lenient, isn't it?

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.480
Long Xia.

00:23:05.519 --> 00:23:06.640
Bring the whip.

00:24:16.839 --> 00:24:17.839
An'er!

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:23.279
Stop hitting him! Any more and there'll be trouble!

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.880
Let it be, then.

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:27.480
Alright.

00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.880
You may proceed.

00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.279
Withdraw!

00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:35.599
Inoue.

00:24:36.039 --> 00:24:37.279
Aren't you returning to the unit?

00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:38.680
No.

00:24:39.039 --> 00:24:41.400
The plane crashed near this village.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.039
This village needs a thorough search.

00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.480
Everyone, move aside!

00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:50.920
A life-saving grace!

00:24:51.799 --> 00:24:55.000
Elder Ye is truly the savior of our Chen family.

00:24:56.759 --> 00:24:57.640
Quick, carry him back

00:24:58.400 --> 00:24:59.000
and tend to his wounds.

00:25:13.559 --> 00:25:14.640
Disperse now.

00:25:17.599 --> 00:25:19.200
Fellow villagers, please disperse.

00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:22.079
Everyone, disperse.

00:25:22.559 --> 00:25:24.240
Everyone, stay alert!

00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:25.440
Search this village thoroughly.

00:25:25.440 --> 00:25:26.200
Look for anything suspicious.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.279
Look for anything suspicious.

00:25:27.279 --> 00:25:28.599
Understood?

00:25:28.599 --> 00:25:29.359
Understood!

00:25:31.920 --> 00:25:33.160
Left, face!

00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:34.960
Double time, march!

00:25:56.759 --> 00:25:57.359
Master!

00:25:57.359 --> 00:25:57.799
Fourth Auntie!

00:25:57.960 --> 00:25:59.000
Something terrible has happened!

00:25:59.000 --> 00:25:59.599
What is it?

00:26:02.079 --> 00:26:03.279
The simpleton and I, on the beach,

00:26:03.279 --> 00:26:04.759
rescued an American.

00:26:08.079 --> 00:26:09.839
Nobody move!

00:26:09.839 --> 00:26:10.319
Don't shoot!

00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:11.920
We're all civilians!

00:26:12.359 --> 00:26:13.039
Sir!

00:26:13.039 --> 00:26:14.960
We haven't done anything!

00:26:15.799 --> 00:26:16.960
Go, quickly!

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:17.720
Don't go!

00:26:22.119 --> 00:26:23.759
You're not a Japanese soldier?

00:26:24.200 --> 00:26:25.000
No.

00:26:27.559 --> 00:26:28.400
I'm an American.

00:26:30.319 --> 00:26:31.079
Hurry up.

00:26:34.640 --> 00:26:35.559
Where is he?

00:26:35.559 --> 00:26:36.839
He's at my house.

00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:46.079
Relax.

00:26:51.319 --> 00:26:54.359
I know what you're thinking.

00:26:55.119 --> 00:26:56.559
Why do I speak English?

00:26:56.559 --> 00:26:57.200
Right?

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.400
I was once a consul stationed in America.

00:27:03.799 --> 00:27:05.200
Where in America?

00:27:05.640 --> 00:27:07.279
Honolulu, Hawaii.

00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:14.759
Where is this?

00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:18.480
Sanzao Island.

00:27:19.119 --> 00:27:22.279
The Japanese call it the 6th Air Base.

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.319
Please tell me,

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:26.000
how can I get out of here?

00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:27.799
Young man,

00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:30.480
this is a place

00:27:31.359 --> 00:27:33.000
you can't get into,

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.599
and you can't get out of.

00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.279
What are you saying?

00:27:41.119 --> 00:27:42.400
Can you tell me

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.480
who you are?

00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:47.519
I am an aviation advisor

00:27:47.519 --> 00:27:49.880
to General Stilwell in the China Theater.

00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.680
I'm a Chinese American.

00:27:54.839 --> 00:27:57.440
My ancestors immigrated to the U.S.

00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:59.559
Sir,

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:03.000
I am simply a professional soldier.

00:28:03.759 --> 00:28:04.720
Of course,

00:28:05.200 --> 00:28:06.160
I don't believe

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.279
it has anything to do with my skin color or race.

00:28:08.839 --> 00:28:09.839
However,

00:28:11.039 --> 00:28:13.119
my superiors chose me for this mission.

00:28:13.880 --> 00:28:16.200
Perhaps they had their reasons.

00:28:16.200 --> 00:28:18.799
Perhaps they had their reasons.

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:20.359
Do you speak Chinese?

00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:25.279
If you want to stay alive,

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.480
start brushing up on your Chinese.

00:28:30.519 --> 00:28:31.559
Can you tell me

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:33.480
what I can do for you?

00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:38.279
Please help me notify the Chinese government

00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.480
that I've landed here.

00:28:41.480 --> 00:28:43.200
I've already told you,

00:28:43.759 --> 00:28:44.640
this island

00:28:44.759 --> 00:28:46.920
has been occupied by the Japanese for three years.

00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:48.799
It's under tight blockade.

00:28:49.839 --> 00:28:51.720
No one can come or go freely.

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:05.519
Don't shoot.

00:29:06.279 --> 00:29:07.160
If you fire that gun,

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:08.559
we're all finished.

00:29:09.799 --> 00:29:10.359
Grandma,

00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:11.920
where can we hide him?

00:29:12.039 --> 00:29:13.079
Right under this bed.

00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:15.920
You hide under there first.

00:29:16.079 --> 00:29:16.880
Be patient for a while.

00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.079
Tonight,

00:29:18.079 --> 00:29:19.759
I'll take you to our house.

00:29:20.799 --> 00:29:21.240
Alright.

00:29:30.599 --> 00:29:31.440
Xia'er!

00:29:32.519 --> 00:29:33.039
Dad!

00:29:33.039 --> 00:29:33.559
I'm here!

00:29:33.559 --> 00:29:33.920
Xia'er,

00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:35.640
come here.

00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.599
Quickly, pass this to your uncle.

00:29:42.119 --> 00:29:43.759
Tell him to notify Wu Fazai as soon as possible.

00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:45.319
What's so urgent?

00:29:45.319 --> 00:29:45.759
Dad,

00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.799
Fourth Grandma saved an American.

00:29:49.880 --> 00:29:50.799
An American?

00:29:50.799 --> 00:29:51.279
Yes.

00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:53.160
He seems important.

00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:53.559
Hurry up

00:29:53.559 --> 00:29:54.480
and pass it on.

00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:17.400
Director,

00:30:21.440 --> 00:30:22.559
we've received a telegram from the 4th War Zone.

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:23.599
Read it quickly.

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:26.880
We have received intelligence from Sanzao Island.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:28.039
An Allied aircraft

00:30:28.039 --> 00:30:29.519
was shot down over Sanzao Island.

00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:30.880
One survivor claims to be

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.160
an aviation advisor to General Stilwell.

00:30:32.160 --> 00:30:32.839
He parachuted out, severely wounded,

00:30:32.839 --> 00:30:35.079
and was rescued by Sanzao Island fishermen.

00:30:35.279 --> 00:30:36.279
He is now hidden in a home.

00:30:36.559 --> 00:30:38.960
He successfully bailed out. Unfortunately,

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:42.319
he is trapped on an isolated island fully occupied by the Japanese.

00:30:42.880 --> 00:30:45.319
Our rescue operation is now urgently underway.

00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:47.079
Do they know

00:30:47.079 --> 00:30:48.440
this man's importance?

00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.440
He absolutely must not fall into Japanese hands.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.920
He absolutely must not fall into Japanese hands.

00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:52.880
Yes.

00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:55.480
They understand the importance of this matter.

00:30:55.640 --> 00:30:57.720
If we cannot rescue him,

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.599
China will also send someone to shoot him,

00:30:59.599 --> 00:31:04.759
to ensure he does not fall into Japanese hands.

00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:09.359
Dai Li,

00:31:10.799 --> 00:31:11.480
I know

00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.799
you still have an action team in Tokyo, Japan.

00:31:16.079 --> 00:31:17.759
It has never been activated, correct?

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:18.920
Generalissimo,

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:22.359
Activate your Tokyo team.

00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.039
Now is the time.

00:31:28.319 --> 00:31:29.400
Broadcast this.

00:31:29.559 --> 00:31:31.039
Wait for my phone call

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:32.400
before stopping.

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:34.400
At four-fifty,

00:31:34.799 --> 00:31:35.839
five-fifty,

00:31:36.079 --> 00:31:37.000
six-fifty,

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.319
and eight-fifty,

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.039
broadcast it three times each.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:40.920
Understood.

00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:48.799
This is the China Central News Agency.

00:31:49.079 --> 00:31:52.160
It is now time for the missing persons broadcast.

00:31:52.839 --> 00:31:54.759
Mr. Liao Zhi.

00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:56.799
Mr. Liao Zhi.

00:31:57.079 --> 00:31:58.960
Ms. He Fangfang.

00:31:59.359 --> 00:32:01.279
Ms. He Fangfang.

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:04.119
After the fall of Nanjing,

00:32:04.119 --> 00:32:06.519
your father, Liao Yuanda,

00:32:06.519 --> 00:32:08.599
has arrived in Chongqing.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:11.440
He is currently residing at

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.920
No. 6, Yi Alley, Shancheng Avenue.

00:32:14.359 --> 00:32:16.480
He eagerly awaits your contact.

00:32:18.039 --> 00:32:19.920
Broadcast it again.

00:32:22.759 --> 00:32:26.079
It is now time for the missing persons broadcast.

00:32:26.519 --> 00:32:28.359
Mr. Liao Zhi.

00:32:28.359 --> 00:32:30.279
Mr. Liao Zhi.

00:32:30.799 --> 00:32:32.680
Ms. He Fangfang.

00:32:45.400 --> 00:32:46.640
Familiarize yourself with this.

00:32:47.559 --> 00:32:48.839
You must memorize it.

00:32:48.839 --> 00:32:50.319
Do not leave any written notes.

00:32:51.039 --> 00:32:52.079
No problem.

00:32:53.839 --> 00:32:55.000
Takeuchi Ichiro.

00:32:55.559 --> 00:32:56.720
That's him.

00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:59.119
This Takeuchi Ichiro...

00:32:59.119 --> 00:33:00.640
was born in 1912.

00:33:01.599 --> 00:33:03.000
Codename: Lumberjack.

00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:06.720
He is from Minqing, Fujian.

00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:09.480
His father, Lin Yuanda,

00:33:10.319 --> 00:33:11.119
in his early years,

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.440
was a merchant dealing in mining machinery.

00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:17.240
When he was six years old,

00:33:17.920 --> 00:33:19.839
his father, who was traveling to Japan

00:33:19.839 --> 00:33:22.279
on a ship transporting goods,

00:33:22.279 --> 00:33:25.200
died when the ship sank in a storm in the Sea of Japan.

00:33:25.559 --> 00:33:27.920
Left with no choice, his mother

00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:29.400
took six-year-old him

00:33:29.839 --> 00:33:31.519
and remarried

00:33:31.519 --> 00:33:34.200
her late husband's good friend, Takeuchi Kaio.

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:37.839
Lin Sen subsequently changed his name to Takeuchi Ichiro.

00:33:40.759 --> 00:33:42.039
This man's character is

00:33:42.559 --> 00:33:43.720
loyal and brave,

00:33:44.559 --> 00:33:45.680
calm and composed,

00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.160
unflappable in handling affairs,

00:33:47.920 --> 00:33:49.039
analytical,

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:51.759
steady and low-key,

00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:53.519
methodical in his work.

00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.799
His current position is in the Japanese Imperial

00:33:57.319 --> 00:34:00.440
Guard Office, Investigation Section, as an investigator.

00:34:00.799 --> 00:34:01.720
He holds the rank of colonel.

00:34:06.079 --> 00:34:07.319
The higher-ups have long suspected

00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:09.199
that within the Special Higher Police

00:34:09.519 --> 00:34:10.840
and also within the Military Police,

00:34:11.119 --> 00:34:12.320
there are Communist operatives.

00:34:13.519 --> 00:34:14.039
Are you one?

00:34:15.239 --> 00:34:16.239
Yes.

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:34.679
Nobuo Takahashi,

00:34:35.239 --> 00:34:36.039
for the crime of treason

00:34:36.440 --> 00:34:36.960
and resisting arrest,

00:34:37.639 --> 00:34:38.320
has been shot dead.

00:34:48.519 --> 00:34:49.159
Director.

00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:51.239
You are truly remarkable.

00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.599
Takeuchi Ichiro

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:55.840
graduated from

00:34:56.519 --> 00:34:57.960
the Army Academy.

00:34:57.960 --> 00:34:58.760
After graduation,

00:34:58.760 --> 00:34:59.880
with outstanding grades,

00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:02.599
he qualified for a government-funded study abroad program.

00:35:02.599 --> 00:35:04.000
In the 19th year of the Republic,

00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.519
he was sent to Shanghai, China on a government scholarship.

00:35:06.519 --> 00:35:09.119
He studied at the Shanghai East Asia Common Culture Academy.

00:35:12.039 --> 00:35:15.280
Safeguard peace, oppose war.

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:18.519
Safeguard peace, oppose war.

00:35:18.519 --> 00:35:22.039
Safeguard peace, oppose war.

00:35:22.039 --> 00:35:25.239
Safeguard peace, oppose war.

00:35:25.239 --> 00:35:28.480
Safeguard peace, oppose war.

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:31.719
Safeguard peace, oppose war.

00:35:31.719 --> 00:35:33.559
Safeguard peace...

00:35:37.599 --> 00:35:39.800
What are you doing?

00:35:40.679 --> 00:35:41.360
What are you doing?

00:35:42.320 --> 00:35:43.480
What right do you have to hit people?

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:45.920
In all the Military Statistics Bureau files,

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.960
there is no record of the fact that

00:35:47.960 --> 00:35:51.440
after that arrest incident at the Common Culture Academy,

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.800
the shrewd and steady Takeuchi Ichiro

00:35:53.800 --> 00:35:56.599
immediately abandoned this inexperienced

00:35:56.599 --> 00:35:59.000
and unstrategic mode of struggle.

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.280
Soon, he and his classmate Akanishi Ryusawa

00:36:00.280 --> 00:36:02.360
Soon, he and his classmate Akanishi Ryusawa,

00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:03.159
through their teacher at the Common Culture Academy,

00:36:03.159 --> 00:36:04.320
through their teacher at the Common Culture Academy,

00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:07.079
a secret member of the Chinese Communist Party, economics professor

00:36:07.079 --> 00:36:09.000
Wang Yanwu,

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.119
together met

00:36:10.119 --> 00:36:13.199
the CCP representative stationed in Shanghai, Pan,

00:36:13.199 --> 00:36:15.360
and, upon his recommendation,

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:18.199
joined the Chinese Communist Party.

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:28.719
Now is the time for broadcast announcements.

00:36:29.079 --> 00:36:33.320
Mr. Liao Zhi,

00:36:33.320 --> 00:36:38.239
Ms. He Fangfang.

00:36:38.239 --> 00:36:40.320
After the fall of Nanjing,

00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:42.639
your father, Liao Yuanda,

00:36:42.639 --> 00:36:44.679
has arrived in Chongqing.

00:36:45.079 --> 00:36:47.800
He is currently living on Shancheng Street,

00:36:47.800 --> 00:36:50.039
Alley Yi, Courtyard Number Six.

00:36:50.800 --> 00:36:52.960
He hopes you will contact him.

00:36:57.519 --> 00:36:58.920
Mother, I need to go out.

00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.559
I'll be back for dinner.

00:37:06.119 --> 00:37:06.880
Understood.

00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:37.159
An engineer at Komatsu Manufacturing...

00:37:37.159 --> 00:37:38.519
...lives in a decent place.

00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:41.559
Takeuchi-san, please come in.

00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.559
After the Pearl Harbor incident broke out,

00:37:53.559 --> 00:37:55.480
I guessed you would come to me soon.

00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:56.920
But I didn't expect

00:37:56.920 --> 00:37:58.639
to wait for you for nearly a hundred days.

00:37:59.719 --> 00:38:00.719
They attacked Pearl Harbor.

00:38:00.719 --> 00:38:01.800
What does that have to do with me?

00:38:04.119 --> 00:38:05.000
And you?

00:38:05.280 --> 00:38:06.039
How have you been?

00:38:06.039 --> 00:38:06.840
Well?

00:38:12.119 --> 00:38:14.719
I was fine before you came.

00:38:22.639 --> 00:38:24.639
The war between China and Japan

00:38:24.639 --> 00:38:26.239
has been going on for over a decade.

00:38:26.920 --> 00:38:29.360
Now we're also fighting America.

00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:33.480
Now the whole of Southeast Asia is also at war.

00:38:33.480 --> 00:38:35.159
It seems only Tokyo is untouched by the war.

00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:37.159
We

00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:38.480
seem to have been forgotten

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.559
by both our enemies

00:38:39.559 --> 00:38:40.760
and our friends.

00:38:54.480 --> 00:38:56.360
Your move.

00:38:58.119 --> 00:39:00.840
I didn't want to come find you. How boring.

00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:27.159
After the 12th year of Showa,

00:39:27.159 --> 00:39:29.320
I never used it again.

00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.000
But I maintained it every week,

00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.519
just for today,

00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.960
waiting for you to come.

00:39:39.679 --> 00:39:40.639
Prepare to transmit.

00:39:40.639 --> 00:39:41.119
Alright.

00:39:58.440 --> 00:39:59.679
Mr. Chen Qiao.

00:40:02.079 --> 00:40:03.320
Mr. Chen Qiao.

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.639
Mr. Chen Qiao.

00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:17.079
Mr. Chen Qiao.

00:40:17.079 --> 00:40:17.920
Excuse me.

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.639
Why did it take you so long to open the door?

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:20.639
Sorry.

00:40:20.639 --> 00:40:21.480
I was in the toilet.

00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:22.480
What is the matter?

00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:25.280
The 101st Division

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:26.960
has issued a recruitment order.

00:40:28.239 --> 00:40:29.360
The focus of the recruitment

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:31.239
is right in our area.

00:40:31.639 --> 00:40:33.000
Mr. Ida has been sent down from above

00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.800
specifically to handle this recruitment.

00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:38.559
You are?

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.199
Kaigawa Chen Qiao.

00:40:40.199 --> 00:40:41.000
Yes.

00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:43.000
Thirty-eight years old.

00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:43.639
Yes.

00:40:46.679 --> 00:40:47.840
Please show me your identification.

00:40:52.440 --> 00:40:53.679
Please wait a moment.

00:40:56.800 --> 00:40:58.000
Mr. Chen Qiao,

00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.199
he is not within the scope of our current recruitment.

00:41:12.119 --> 00:41:13.199
Sir

00:41:17.079 --> 00:41:19.320
Mr. Chen Qiao studied science and engineering.

00:41:20.639 --> 00:41:23.000
I am an engineer at Komatsu Manufacturing.

00:41:25.519 --> 00:41:27.320
I design tank engines.

00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:28.559
Yes.

00:41:28.559 --> 00:41:30.199
That's very impressive.

00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:31.719
Excuse me.

00:41:32.119 --> 00:41:33.400
Pardon the intrusion.

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:36.719
Mr. Chen Qiao,

00:41:36.719 --> 00:41:38.920
is not within our current recruitment scope.

00:41:38.920 --> 00:41:39.760
Is that so?

00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.719
Well, thank you for your trouble.

00:41:43.480 --> 00:41:45.760
Sorry to bother you.

00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:51.880
We'll be leaving now.

00:41:54.639 --> 00:41:55.239
Mr. Chen Qiao,

00:41:56.440 --> 00:41:57.519
at home,

00:41:57.519 --> 00:41:58.679
are you alone?

00:41:58.679 --> 00:41:59.519
I'm alone.

00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:06.679
Sir,

00:42:06.679 --> 00:42:08.199
please wait.

00:42:08.199 --> 00:42:09.280
This is a private residence.

00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:10.679
Ida.

00:42:25.840 --> 00:42:27.760
Sir, wait.
