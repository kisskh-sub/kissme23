00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:57.920
Congratulations.

00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:00.200
Great.

00:02:02.439 --> 00:02:03.280
Roast Duck King.

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:05.560

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.560
Congratulations as well.

00:02:11.759 --> 00:02:12.639
Now, next up,

00:02:12.639 --> 00:02:13.800
we will take a short break

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.680
before entering the second round's comprehensive roast duck skills competition.

00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:19.039
Let's wait and see.

00:02:21.599 --> 00:02:22.479
Are you thirsty?

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:23.439
Here, have some water.

00:02:23.439 --> 00:02:24.319
Where's the water?

00:02:24.319 --> 00:02:25.120
I... I didn't bring it.

00:02:25.319 --> 00:02:26.520
Why didn't you bring it?

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.520
Go out and buy some.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.520
I have some.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.120
You silly kid.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:41.360
Chef Sun, how are you feeling?

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:42.439
After the first round,

00:02:42.439 --> 00:02:43.879
I feel my condition is just right.

00:02:43.879 --> 00:02:45.199
I'm even more confident in my skills now.

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:46.280
That's excellent.

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:48.199
President Dong,

00:02:48.479 --> 00:02:49.919
in this competition,

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:52.120
if Chef Sun gets eliminated,

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:53.800
he's a proud man.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:55.400
You shouldn't get too angry either.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:56.560
Watch your words.

00:02:57.159 --> 00:02:59.400
I think you should go check on your big brother instead.

00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:01.280
Don't play mind games with me here.

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:03.599
That's right, Manager Li.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.280
You've got it backwards.

00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.080
You're talking about Master Wang, right?

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.800
My big brother is just warming up now.

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:12.199
He'll turn up the heat for you all later.

00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.000
Chef Sun,

00:03:14.159 --> 00:03:16.199
you don't seem to be in good form today.

00:03:16.479 --> 00:03:18.319
You're starting to break out in a cold sweat.

00:03:19.479 --> 00:03:20.919
You're absolutely right.

00:03:21.199 --> 00:03:24.439
As long as my hands don't falter, it's fine.

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:25.840
Indeed, indeed.

00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:28.120
I mean well, you know.

00:03:28.199 --> 00:03:29.199
No other intentions.

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:31.439
Alright, you two chat.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:33.840
Chef Sun,

00:03:33.879 --> 00:03:35.479
don't let him get to you.

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:37.599
He's been full of mischief since he was a kid.

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:38.400
President Dong,

00:03:38.680 --> 00:03:40.599
with me here, you can rest assured.

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.240
Alright, let's go.

00:03:57.759 --> 00:04:00.319
Do you think big brother can make it to the finals?

00:04:01.319 --> 00:04:02.319
Stay calm.

00:04:02.479 --> 00:04:03.599
Is this okay?

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:07.319
He should at least make the finals, right?

00:04:07.319 --> 00:04:08.080
Don't worry.

00:04:08.439 --> 00:04:11.879
Based on the comprehensive scores from two rounds,

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.479
the three contestants entering tomorrow's

00:04:15.479 --> 00:04:18.639
All-Duck Feast ultimate showdown are:

00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:23.120
First place, Chef Sun from Spring River Warms.

00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:23.839
Congratulations.

00:04:23.839 --> 00:04:26.759
Well done.

00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:28.160
Second place,

00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:31.079
from Duck Workshop,

00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:32.399
the renowned roast duck chef,

00:04:32.399 --> 00:04:33.120
Chef Cao.

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:33.839
Congratulations.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:39.839
The final contestant entering tomorrow's finals

00:04:39.839 --> 00:04:40.959
is, who could it be?

00:04:41.199 --> 00:04:43.120
He is none other than

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:45.639
Master Wang from Peng Le Xuan.

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:46.639
Congratulations to you.

00:04:46.639 --> 00:04:48.120
Dad, go for it!

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:54.519
Come on, brothers, everyone put these on.

00:04:55.639 --> 00:04:56.120
Put them on.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:56.959
Big brother,

00:04:57.279 --> 00:04:59.120
you've got the aura of the "Guardian of Baofang" from back in the day.

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:00.560
That's what you said.

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:02.959
Big brother, you mustn't feel any pressure.

00:05:02.959 --> 00:05:05.120
Aren't you the one putting pressure on me?

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.120
The Roast Duck King title is in the bag.

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.680
Big brother, congratulations!

00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:08.959
You made it to the finals.

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:11.240
Just perform as you normally do.

00:05:11.399 --> 00:05:11.800
Alright.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:12.680
See you tomorrow then.

00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:13.360
See you tomorrow.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:14.399
See you tomorrow.

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:15.680
See you tomorrow, sis-in-law.

00:05:31.959 --> 00:05:34.240
Jing'er, these are all snacks to go with drinks.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.240
We should make a couple of meat dishes.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.399
The spare ribs are stewing in the pot.

00:05:39.519 --> 00:05:41.040
Second Brother, Qiu'er, we're happy today.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.360
You two should have a few extra drinks.

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:43.639
Hey, what about me?

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:44.639
You can't drink.

00:05:45.319 --> 00:05:47.079
Sis, I'm driving today.

00:05:47.079 --> 00:05:48.079
I really can't drink.

00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:49.600
Let Qiu'er have a drink with Big Brother.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.639
No, I'll have a drink with Qiu'er.

00:05:50.639 --> 00:05:52.199
Exactly, exactly, let's be happy.

00:05:52.199 --> 00:05:53.920
You still can't drink.

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:54.759
Look at you.

00:05:54.759 --> 00:05:55.920
Qiu'er, you drink up.

00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:57.199
Got it.

00:05:57.199 --> 00:06:00.879
Then get some water for me and your Second Uncle.

00:06:00.879 --> 00:06:01.360
Okay.

00:06:01.519 --> 00:06:04.639
So I'm drinking alone and getting tipsy.

00:06:05.439 --> 00:06:08.199
Doesn't that seem a bit lonely and cold?

00:06:08.199 --> 00:06:09.079
Let me tell you.

00:06:09.079 --> 00:06:10.759
This liquor is really good.

00:06:10.759 --> 00:06:11.600
Really?

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:13.319
Here.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.759
Don't tell your mom.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:19.600
Here.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.079
The soup's ready!

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.079
Come on, come on.

00:06:23.879 --> 00:06:25.000
Let's start eating!

00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.800
Then let me propose the first toast.

00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.800
We're really happy today.

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:34.199
Happy, happy, happy! Come on, come on.

00:06:34.199 --> 00:06:36.079
Come on, come on.

00:06:36.079 --> 00:06:37.319
Husband, you worked hard.

00:06:37.600 --> 00:06:38.920
Big Brother really showed

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:40.360
the momentum of the "Guardian of Baofang" today.

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:41.199
Of course.

00:06:41.199 --> 00:06:42.319
Here.

00:06:44.759 --> 00:06:46.079
Come on, eat, eat, eat the dishes.

00:06:46.079 --> 00:06:48.920
Dad, weren't you nervous today?

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.800
What nonsense are you talking, kid?

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.920
Would your dad be nervous?

00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:53.040
No, no, no.

00:06:53.040 --> 00:06:54.319
There are no outsiders here.

00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:56.720
I'll speak from the heart.

00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.480
To give you a thumbs-up,

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.600
you were far from me, you know?

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.920
Didn't you see my legs were

00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.480
shaking like a sieve, you know?

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:05.240
No.

00:07:05.240 --> 00:07:06.040
I saw it.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:06.959
I even filmed it.

00:07:06.959 --> 00:07:08.600
But remember this, kid.

00:07:09.639 --> 00:07:11.199
No matter what difficulty you face,

00:07:11.839 --> 00:07:13.279
this afternoon you felt

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:14.600
pretty nervous too, right?

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:16.600
But so what?

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.920
Didn't we get through it?

00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.040
And now we're sitting at the same table drinking, right?

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:21.720
Right.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:23.600
Nothing is a problem.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:24.720
Come on, come on.

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:27.199
Here, here, here.

00:07:27.399 --> 00:07:29.040
Qiu'er, you drink more today.

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:30.160
You're the only one drinking.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:32.399
Then I'll take a big sip, a big sip.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.600
We two are drinking water.

00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:35.600
Let's have one with Qiu'er.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:36.040
Here.

00:07:37.519 --> 00:07:38.759
Burns the throat, burns the throat.

00:07:41.639 --> 00:07:43.600
We've already won half the battle today.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.600
Big Brother, just treat tomorrow like going to have fun.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:47.800
No matter the result,

00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:48.600
we're just aiming for a good time.

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:50.040
No, no, no.

00:07:50.040 --> 00:07:51.360
If we want to be happy,

00:07:51.399 --> 00:07:53.360
we need a good result.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.279
Don't worry.

00:07:55.839 --> 00:07:56.920
Tomorrow, watch Big Brother.

00:07:58.399 --> 00:08:00.079
Now that we have this first round today,

00:08:00.319 --> 00:08:01.279
the next round,

00:08:01.399 --> 00:08:03.839
I'll just treat it as making good food in a different place.

00:08:03.839 --> 00:08:04.720
Isn't that all it is?

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.240
Yes, exactly.

00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.680
Here, brothers, well,

00:08:06.839 --> 00:08:09.240
you two also worried about Big Brother today.

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:10.120
Not at all.

00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:11.040
I toast to you two.

00:08:11.519 --> 00:08:12.279
It's what we should do.

00:08:12.279 --> 00:08:12.959
Should, should do.

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:13.720
You went to a lot of trouble.

00:08:13.959 --> 00:08:14.839
Keep drinking.

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:20.720
And wife, here.

00:08:20.839 --> 00:08:21.839
You're toasting me too?

00:08:21.839 --> 00:08:24.600
You, you also worked hard and achieved a lot today.

00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:25.600
Husband worked hard, husband worked hard.

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:26.720
You worked hard, hard, hard today.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:28.399
Look, my husband is happy today.

00:08:28.399 --> 00:08:30.600
Even drinking water tastes like liquor now.

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.839
Happy, happy.

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:34.759
Dad.

00:08:35.279 --> 00:08:36.399
I also toast to you.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:38.399
This son is really sensible, I tell you.

00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:39.600
Tomorrow, just go for it.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.360
Good.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.039
Good.

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:46.159
This should be no problem.

00:08:46.159 --> 00:08:47.519
It can be considered a great success, right?

00:08:48.039 --> 00:08:49.360
This is just the beginning.

00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.279
Tomorrow is the real tough battle.

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:53.600
Wait a minute.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.960
Weren't you just telling Big Brother

00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:56.279
winning or losing wasn't the issue?

00:08:56.279 --> 00:08:57.639
Didn't you see?

00:08:58.159 --> 00:09:00.279
Big Brother is actually really nervous inside.

00:09:00.519 --> 00:09:02.279
Otherwise, why would he keep looking for liquor

00:09:02.279 --> 00:09:03.399
and guzzling it down?

00:09:04.399 --> 00:09:05.080
That's true.

00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:06.720
He finished a cup so quickly.

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.320
So what do we do?

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.600
You go back first.

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.919
I'm going to find Dong Qian.

00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:14.720
Why are you looking for Dong Qian now?

00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:16.600
I need to have a word with her.

00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:18.480
Doesn't she care about Big Brother's feelings at all?

00:09:19.399 --> 00:09:20.399
Then, I'll go with you.

00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:21.039
No, no, no.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.720
It's easier if I talk to her myself.

00:09:35.559 --> 00:09:38.200
You didn't tell me Big Brother could make it to the finals.

00:09:38.559 --> 00:09:39.679
I didn't expect it either.

00:09:41.679 --> 00:09:42.440
Wei Guo.

00:09:42.559 --> 00:09:44.480
You're not deliberately tricking me, are you?

00:09:44.679 --> 00:09:46.559
The more I think about it, the more something feels off.

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.799
If you don't trust me enough,

00:09:48.879 --> 00:09:50.480
then we have no basis for cooperation.

00:09:50.759 --> 00:09:51.919
Think about it carefully.

00:09:52.159 --> 00:09:54.519
What good would deceiving you do for me?

00:09:57.039 --> 00:09:58.240
You also know the kind of person I am.

00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.799
Things without benefit,

00:09:59.919 --> 00:10:01.039
I won't do.

00:10:01.519 --> 00:10:02.360
That's it.

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:25.120
What are you doing here?

00:10:25.879 --> 00:10:27.320
I was about to ask you the same thing.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.240
Get in the car.

00:10:38.799 --> 00:10:39.679
We'll talk when we get back.

00:10:55.399 --> 00:10:56.639
You'd better explain yourself properly.

00:10:57.279 --> 00:10:58.639
You met with Dong Qian privately.

00:10:58.639 --> 00:10:59.519
What is the meaning of this?

00:11:01.759 --> 00:11:03.519
I don't think I need to explain myself to you.

00:11:04.639 --> 00:11:05.600
Not talking, huh?

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.519
Fine, I'll go get Big Brother.

00:11:07.519 --> 00:11:08.399
You can tell him.

00:11:09.720 --> 00:11:10.840
Don't disturb Big Brother.

00:11:12.279 --> 00:11:14.600
I went to Dong Qian for a collaboration.

00:11:14.639 --> 00:11:16.039
To get her to invest in Peng Le Xuan.

00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:21.399
It's hard to guard against a thief in the family.

00:11:21.399 --> 00:11:24.120
We tried hard to stop Dong Qian from taking Peng Le Xuan.

00:11:24.279 --> 00:11:25.840
And you just sold us out like that?

00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:26.919
No.

00:11:27.399 --> 00:11:29.639
The investment I mean isn't what you think.

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:33.440
Go on, keep making things up.

00:11:34.519 --> 00:11:36.919
I want her to invest in Peng Le Xuan.

00:11:37.039 --> 00:11:38.879
Not so she can buy the brand name.

00:11:38.879 --> 00:11:40.519
To package her Spring River Warms.

00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:42.519
What I want to do is...

00:11:42.519 --> 00:11:44.039
get her to take Spring River Warms...

00:11:44.039 --> 00:11:45.399
and merge it into Peng Le Xuan.

00:11:45.399 --> 00:11:47.519
Giving all resources to Peng Le Xuan...

00:11:47.519 --> 00:11:48.639
for Peng Le Xuan to use.

00:11:49.399 --> 00:11:50.759
Are you kidding me?

00:11:50.759 --> 00:11:52.159
How could such a good thing happen?

00:11:52.279 --> 00:11:54.159
Don't tell me you're serious.

00:11:55.399 --> 00:11:56.000
No...

00:11:56.519 --> 00:11:58.159
Why would she listen to you?

00:11:59.159 --> 00:12:00.399
Wait until Big Brother finishes the competition tomorrow.

00:12:00.399 --> 00:12:01.919
We'll see the result then, okay?

00:12:02.159 --> 00:12:03.399
You explain this clearly to me.

00:12:04.519 --> 00:12:05.879
Why would she listen to you?

00:12:05.879 --> 00:12:07.120
Why would she cooperate with you?

00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:08.639
Speak up!

00:12:32.639 --> 00:12:34.919
The excitement continues. The finals begin!

00:12:35.279 --> 00:12:36.879
The three finalists...

00:12:36.879 --> 00:12:39.039
have each brought an assistant chef.

00:12:39.039 --> 00:12:41.039
Within the allotted time...

00:12:41.039 --> 00:12:42.879
they will cook live on site...

00:12:42.919 --> 00:12:44.360
designated by the panel of experts...

00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:46.519
the roast duck from the All-Duck Feast...

00:12:46.519 --> 00:12:47.759
Golden Thread Duck Rolls...

00:12:47.759 --> 00:12:50.000
Fire-Singed Duck Hearts, Mustard Duck Webs...

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.399
Spicy Braised Duck Liver...

00:12:51.519 --> 00:12:53.039
Braised Duck Soup with Taro...

00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:55.279
Kung Pao Duck Wings, and other dishes...

00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:57.120
to form their respective All-Duck Feast.

00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:00.039
Finally, our expert panel of judges...

00:13:00.039 --> 00:13:02.080
will give the final scores...

00:13:02.279 --> 00:13:04.639
to decide this year's Roast Duck King.

00:13:04.759 --> 00:13:05.799
Now I declare...

00:13:05.919 --> 00:13:09.039
the finals officially begin!

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.200
His performance is quite consistent.

00:13:25.759 --> 00:13:26.440
Indeed.

00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:33.360
Truly authentic.

00:14:05.799 --> 00:14:07.639
Spread it out a bit more.

00:14:08.679 --> 00:14:10.840
Cut it more like a fan.

00:14:13.399 --> 00:14:14.559
Just focus on your cutting.

00:14:14.679 --> 00:14:15.720
Don't be nervous.

00:14:44.159 --> 00:14:45.559
The three finalists...

00:14:45.559 --> 00:14:48.200
have completed their respective All-Duck Feasts.

00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:50.159
Judges, please step forward...

00:14:50.279 --> 00:14:52.039
to taste and score.

00:14:52.039 --> 00:14:52.919
Please.

00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:14.039
Anything is possible.

00:15:48.399 --> 00:15:50.799
Now, I will announce...

00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:52.559
the final score results.

00:15:52.559 --> 00:15:56.039
It also heralds our Roast Duck King champion...

00:15:56.039 --> 00:15:57.279
who is about to be revealed.

00:16:00.639 --> 00:16:03.279
Chef Sun Yanhui's final score is...

00:16:03.279 --> 00:16:05.159
274 points.

00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:11.799
Chef Cao Xiao's final score is...

00:16:12.159 --> 00:16:14.200
268 points.

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:19.039
Master Wang Chunsheng's final score is...

00:16:20.039 --> 00:16:22.440
also 274 points.

00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.200
Congratulations.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:29.120
Master Wang and Chef Sun have tied.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:29.919
Right?

00:16:29.919 --> 00:16:32.159
According to our competition rules...

00:16:32.279 --> 00:16:34.279
we will enter a tie-breaker round.

00:16:34.279 --> 00:16:35.039
Wait a minute.

00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:37.000
Chef Sun.

00:16:38.360 --> 00:16:40.159
I have a video here.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.919
It has the whole process of my Big Brother cooking.

00:16:43.159 --> 00:16:45.440
It can be handed to the organizers for judgment.

00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:47.080
Judges...

00:16:47.639 --> 00:16:50.200
someone tampered with the brine...

00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.159
that my Big Brother had prepared.

00:16:51.799 --> 00:16:52.679
Fortunately...

00:16:52.799 --> 00:16:55.120
I warned my Big Brother's assistant, Xiao Zhang, early on...

00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.399
to keep a close watch.

00:16:56.799 --> 00:16:58.679
I swapped the sauce you added salt to.

00:16:59.919 --> 00:17:01.120
What do you mean, added salt?

00:17:01.559 --> 00:17:03.039
Don't make false accusations!

00:17:04.559 --> 00:17:06.160
The tampering was all recorded.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:08.799
Chef Sun, do you want to take a look...

00:17:09.319 --> 00:17:10.559
to see if it's your apprentice?

00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:15.400
This is truly outrageous.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:17.519
Yeah, what is he doing?

00:17:17.519 --> 00:17:18.720
This is just too outrageous.

00:17:19.440 --> 00:17:20.200
Come here.

00:17:26.519 --> 00:17:27.799
How could you do such a thing?

00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.319
Who told you to do this?

00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:32.000
I did.

00:17:35.559 --> 00:17:36.599
I'm sorry, everyone.

00:17:36.759 --> 00:17:37.880
This was my idea.

00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:39.039
My master didn't know.

00:17:39.559 --> 00:17:40.240
Bullshit.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.480
You're not worthy of being my apprentice.

00:17:43.839 --> 00:17:44.599
Get out.

00:17:47.839 --> 00:17:48.720
Honorable judges,

00:17:49.319 --> 00:17:50.119
I apologize.

00:17:50.279 --> 00:17:51.880
My subordinate did this.

00:17:52.079 --> 00:17:53.440
It's my failure in discipline.

00:17:53.759 --> 00:17:54.640
Here and now,

00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:58.440
I offer my sincere apology to Master Wang.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:00.799
Enough.

00:18:02.079 --> 00:18:03.880
Your word is enough.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:05.920
Alright.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.640
Then, next,

00:18:08.160 --> 00:18:09.559
we proceed to the tiebreaker round.

00:18:09.559 --> 00:18:12.680
Let's see everyone show their true skills.

00:18:12.839 --> 00:18:13.440
Fine.

00:18:14.759 --> 00:18:15.680
I agree.

00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:17.759
So this matter is just over?

00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:20.119
There's no evidence to prove

00:18:20.119 --> 00:18:22.000
Chef Sun was involved in this.

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.799
And it doesn't affect Master Wang's score.

00:18:24.279 --> 00:18:27.000
Our organizing committee has decided

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:29.240
Please, sit.

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:30.160
Please, sit.

00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:30.960
How does it not affect it?

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:31.839
Sit down first.

00:18:32.440 --> 00:18:33.200
Second Brother.

00:18:37.799 --> 00:18:40.000
Our judging panel's final decision

00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.200
is that the tiebreaker proceeds as scheduled.

00:18:42.839 --> 00:18:44.000
To be the Roast Duck King,

00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.000
one must not only know how to make it,

00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.079
but also how to taste it.

00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:49.880
This tests the sensitivity of one's palate

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:53.200
and knowledge of various specialty foods.

00:18:53.359 --> 00:18:54.559
Therefore, the organizing committee

00:18:54.559 --> 00:18:57.640
has specially selected ten top-tier

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.200
roast duck restaurants' ducks.

00:18:59.319 --> 00:19:01.359
They are arranged on ten separate plates.

00:19:01.559 --> 00:19:02.920
The two contestants

00:19:03.039 --> 00:19:05.440
will come forward to taste each one.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.519
You must identify which roast duck restaurant

00:19:08.519 --> 00:19:10.559
each duck is from. Write

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:14.160
the name of the restaurant for each duck

00:19:14.279 --> 00:19:16.400
on your answer board. Time limit: thirty minutes.

00:19:16.640 --> 00:19:18.920
The contestant who correctly identifies

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:21.680
the most restaurants in the shortest time

00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:25.160
will win this year's Roast Duck King title.

00:19:28.559 --> 00:19:30.000
Using this for the tiebreaker...

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.279
It's his weakest point.

00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.279
Maybe take some anti-nausea medicine?

00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:39.880
Useless. Tried it.

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:41.240
So what?

00:19:41.839 --> 00:19:42.720
Master Wang,

00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:45.640
you were just lucky before.

00:19:45.799 --> 00:19:48.759
Now for the tiebreaker, you need real skill.

00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:53.160
I heard you've developed a little problem recently.

00:19:53.759 --> 00:19:55.319
Good luck to you.

00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.000
Watch your mouth!

00:19:58.279 --> 00:19:59.279
Sun!

00:19:59.839 --> 00:20:01.759
You're being a real coward.

00:20:01.759 --> 00:20:03.519
Didn't get enough of a beating last time?

00:20:03.519 --> 00:20:04.319
You really want a fight, huh?

00:20:04.319 --> 00:20:05.039
Second Brother.

00:20:05.759 --> 00:20:08.039
Chef Sun, what are you doing?

00:20:09.519 --> 00:20:11.880
Big Brother, I'm truly sorry.

00:20:12.039 --> 00:20:13.240
I never thought Sun Yanhui

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.559
would do such a thing.

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:15.720
President Dong.

00:20:17.200 --> 00:20:18.079
Chef Sun.

00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.559
I want to win,

00:20:19.559 --> 00:20:21.680
but not by winning like this.

00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:23.279
From this moment on,

00:20:23.279 --> 00:20:25.359
you have no further connection to Spring River Warms.

00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:26.599
Fine.

00:20:27.759 --> 00:20:29.160
Once I win the championship,

00:20:29.319 --> 00:20:31.039
everyone will be fighting to hire me.

00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.720
You'll regret this.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:35.440
Big Brother.

00:20:35.799 --> 00:20:37.039
Then, our Spring River Warms

00:20:37.039 --> 00:20:38.559
will withdraw from the competition.

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.079
Keep fighting. Good luck.

00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:41.759
We're leaving now.

00:20:41.759 --> 00:20:42.799
Bye, Sister-in-law.

00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:48.240
Sit down and rest for a bit.

00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:18.559
I now declare

00:21:18.880 --> 00:21:22.519
the tiebreaker round officially begun!

00:22:04.640 --> 00:22:06.319
This counts as a forfeit, right?

00:22:34.119 --> 00:22:35.759
How are you? Are you okay?

00:22:36.400 --> 00:22:37.160
I'm fine.

00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.319
Let's continue.

00:22:45.519 --> 00:22:46.599
I'm sorry.

00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:06.240
This won't do.

00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:07.759
Look at Big Brother's condition.

00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:30.000
Go check on him properly.

00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:31.720
Go over and see.

00:23:35.119 --> 00:23:37.079
Cooking while vomiting like this...

00:23:37.079 --> 00:23:39.039
Who would dare eat the duck he makes?

00:23:39.039 --> 00:23:40.119
I'll eat it.

00:23:52.519 --> 00:23:54.519
Master Wang, don't force yourself.

00:23:56.759 --> 00:23:57.559
It's alright.

00:23:58.519 --> 00:23:59.720
Let's continue.

00:24:31.039 --> 00:24:31.920
Chunsheng.

00:24:33.799 --> 00:24:35.599
Maybe we should just give up.

00:24:40.519 --> 00:24:41.319
Big Brother.

00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.759
Amazing!

00:24:58.880 --> 00:24:59.640
He picked it up!

00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.640
This is incredible!

00:26:54.759 --> 00:26:55.599
Have some candy.

00:26:58.839 --> 00:26:59.799
Drink some wine.

00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:01.400
Alright!

00:27:14.279 --> 00:27:16.240
His eyes are too big. Doesn't look like ours.

00:27:18.079 --> 00:27:19.519
Don't cry, don't cry, don't cry.

00:27:19.519 --> 00:27:20.000
Don't cry.

00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.119
Here, here, here.

00:27:21.359 --> 00:27:23.160
No more crying, no more, no more.

00:27:23.160 --> 00:27:24.359
Such a little rascal.

00:29:12.039 --> 00:29:13.039
I have an idea.

00:29:13.039 --> 00:29:14.319
Starting tomorrow,

00:29:14.319 --> 00:29:15.880
we'll find the twenty most popular,

00:29:15.880 --> 00:29:18.640
most distinctive roast duck shops in Beijing online.

00:29:18.799 --> 00:29:21.279
Big Brother will go and taste-test them one by one.

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.880
After each one, he'll write a tasting review.

00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:25.279
Please, take a look, sirs.

00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.559
This duck emphasizes one horizontal cut,

00:29:29.319 --> 00:29:30.200
one vertical cut.

00:29:31.079 --> 00:29:36.519
My big brother is Beijing's greatest Roast Duck King.

00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:37.720
The Guardian of Baofang, the Duck King.

00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:39.720
The Guardian of Baofang, the Duck King.

00:31:32.839 --> 00:31:34.279
The competition results are out.

00:31:34.279 --> 00:31:36.359
Chef Sun and Master Wang

00:31:36.359 --> 00:31:38.599
both completed their tasks

00:31:38.759 --> 00:31:40.359
within the allotted time.

00:31:40.359 --> 00:31:41.359
We also saw that

00:31:41.359 --> 00:31:42.359
Chef Sun

00:31:42.359 --> 00:31:44.440
used less time than Master Wang.

00:31:44.519 --> 00:31:46.599
Master Wang, within the time limit,

00:31:46.599 --> 00:31:48.119
not only answered all questions

00:31:48.119 --> 00:31:50.119
but also gave one extra answer.

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.640
What exactly happened?

00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:54.119
Let the head of our judging panel

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:55.839
reveal the answer for us.

00:31:55.839 --> 00:31:56.519
Please welcome.

00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:01.400
In the final duck meat tasting segment,

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:04.640
the expert panel placed duck meat

00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.119
from two different roast duck shops in the last plate.

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.880
Chef Sun correctly identified one.

00:32:11.119 --> 00:32:13.359
Master Wang correctly identified both.

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:14.759
I hereby declare

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.160
the champion of the Folk Roast Duck King culinary competition

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.680
is Wang Chunsheng.

00:32:19.759 --> 00:32:20.920
Master Wang!

00:33:24.119 --> 00:33:26.720
The Roast Duck King is back!

00:33:28.519 --> 00:33:29.440
Listen to me, everyone.

00:33:29.599 --> 00:33:30.359
Big brother, come on.

00:33:30.359 --> 00:33:30.920
Okay.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:33.000
Three, two, one, go!

00:33:34.319 --> 00:33:36.160
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

00:33:38.279 --> 00:33:39.839
Toss him! Toss him! Toss him!

00:33:39.839 --> 00:33:40.920
Thank you, thank you.

00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:41.920
Chunsheng.

00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:43.839
Darn it, it's a good thing you won the Roast Duck King title.

00:33:43.839 --> 00:33:45.680
Otherwise, all the preparations Lian Bao and I made would've been for nothing.

00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:46.920
Isn't that the truth!

00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:47.599
Thank you, Lian Bao.

00:33:47.599 --> 00:33:48.599
What did I say all along?

00:33:48.599 --> 00:33:50.000
I always said Chunsheng could do it.

00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:51.400
And you all didn't believe me.

00:33:52.119 --> 00:33:52.920
He's amazing!

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:53.839
Thank you, thank you.

00:33:53.839 --> 00:33:54.279
So, what's up?

00:33:54.279 --> 00:33:55.920
We have to record this wonderful moment.

00:33:55.920 --> 00:33:56.400
Right, right, right.

00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.599
Come on, let's take a few snaps.

00:33:57.599 --> 00:33:58.519
Let's get some group photos.

00:33:58.519 --> 00:33:59.839
Come on, come on.

00:34:00.519 --> 00:34:02.240
Tall people stand in the back.

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:04.440
Come on, come on.

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.519
Quick, quick, everyone together.

00:34:05.519 --> 00:34:05.839
Kids, come here.

00:34:05.839 --> 00:34:07.039
Hurry up, hurry up.

00:34:07.359 --> 00:34:08.360
Stand in the middle.

00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.840
Tall ones stand in the back.

00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:11.760
Everyone's here, everyone.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.599
Okay, on three, two, one... Roast Duck King!

00:34:13.599 --> 00:34:17.039
Three, two, one... Roast Duck King!

00:34:44.599 --> 00:34:45.239
What's wrong?

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.599
I'm just a little happy.

00:34:48.159 --> 00:34:49.519
I know you're feeling proud right now.

00:34:49.519 --> 00:34:51.159
Uncle Wang winning the Roast Duck King this time,

00:34:51.159 --> 00:34:52.320
you deserve a lot of the credit.

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:53.840
So,

00:34:54.360 --> 00:34:55.400
strike while the iron is hot.

00:35:03.519 --> 00:35:05.320
You posted my medical record number online.

00:35:05.679 --> 00:35:07.079
My address and ID number,

00:35:07.079 --> 00:35:08.159
why didn't you post those too?

00:35:08.719 --> 00:35:09.599
Don't worry.

00:35:09.599 --> 00:35:11.079
I blurred out everything I needed to.

00:35:11.079 --> 00:35:12.480
No one knows whose it is.

00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:14.440
But that's not the key point.

00:35:14.440 --> 00:35:16.599
The key point is there's crucial information on it.

00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:17.519
What?

00:35:19.119 --> 00:35:19.840
Look.

00:35:23.239 --> 00:35:24.400
Look at this netizen.

00:35:24.679 --> 00:35:26.400
He had the same illness as you.

00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:28.079
He sought treatment everywhere in the world.

00:35:28.079 --> 00:35:29.400
Everyone said he was probably beyond cure.

00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:30.280
That he wouldn't survive.

00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:31.000
And then?

00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:32.400
With a "last resort" mindset,

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.519
he went to see an old Chinese medicine doctor.

00:35:33.519 --> 00:35:34.880
And he was actually cured.

00:35:35.119 --> 00:35:36.639
He just took a bunch of medicine and got better.

00:35:36.639 --> 00:35:37.760
He's still very healthy now.

00:35:38.039 --> 00:35:38.679
Really.

00:35:38.679 --> 00:35:39.599
You know what?

00:35:40.119 --> 00:35:41.920
You sound exactly like a pyramid scheme promoter right now.

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.400
Fine.

00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.239
Then let's go check it out tomorrow.

00:35:44.239 --> 00:35:45.440
Then we'll know if it's true or false.

00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:49.079
It's settled then.

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.400
See you tomorrow.

00:35:52.519 --> 00:35:53.360
See you tomorrow.

00:36:05.519 --> 00:36:09.119
Now it's time for individual photos with the Roast Duck King.

00:36:09.119 --> 00:36:11.400
Come on, me, me, me first.

00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:13.360
Let me get a solo photo with the Roast Duck King first.

00:36:13.360 --> 00:36:14.199
Alright.

00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.360
Three, two, one, go!

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:17.920
Okay, next, next.

00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:19.119
I need one with the Roast Duck King.

00:36:19.119 --> 00:36:19.800
Alright.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:20.440
It's my turn now.

00:36:22.239 --> 00:36:23.320
Okay.

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.039
Okay, next, next.

00:36:25.039 --> 00:36:25.559
Come on, Uncle, come on.

00:36:25.559 --> 00:36:26.400
Come on, Uncle, come on.

00:36:26.719 --> 00:36:27.320
Come on.

00:36:28.039 --> 00:36:29.119
Got it.

00:36:29.119 --> 00:36:30.480
Next, next.

00:36:31.599 --> 00:36:32.400
Uncle Li.

00:36:35.519 --> 00:36:36.639
Alright.

00:36:37.119 --> 00:36:38.239
Next, next.

00:36:38.239 --> 00:36:38.599
Come on.

00:36:38.599 --> 00:36:39.519
Post it on social media, come on.

00:36:39.519 --> 00:36:40.360
Hold this, hold this.

00:36:41.239 --> 00:36:43.639
One, two, three... say cheese!

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:46.239
Post it online, the only one in the community.

00:36:50.039 --> 00:36:52.159
Right, for the family of three, come on.

00:36:52.159 --> 00:36:54.039
Come on, take a picture of the three of us, come on.

00:36:54.800 --> 00:36:56.199
Alright.

00:36:56.199 --> 00:36:58.039
Three, two, one...

00:36:58.039 --> 00:37:00.159
Go! Alright.

00:37:30.079 --> 00:37:32.159
You should give me an explanation now.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.639
I promised you

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.800
I would definitely get Peng Le Xuan for you.

00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.440
I also told you

00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.360
that roast duck shop of yours

00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:41.920
with the backing of Peng Le Xuan,

00:37:42.039 --> 00:37:43.360
would definitely break out.

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:45.440
Neither of those things has changed.

00:37:46.119 --> 00:37:47.119
What's more,

00:37:47.400 --> 00:37:49.719
Big Brother won the Roast Duck King competition.

00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.159
Now Peng Le Xuan's status has risen with him.

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:53.519
Enough, Weiguo.

00:37:53.519 --> 00:37:55.000
Stop beating around the bush with me.

00:37:55.719 --> 00:37:56.960
What exactly do you want?

00:37:58.599 --> 00:38:01.360
I want you to merge Spring River Warms

00:38:01.519 --> 00:38:03.079
into Peng Le Xuan.

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:05.920
With Big Brother, Sister-in-law,

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:06.880
and Lianbao

00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:08.360
as the core trio,

00:38:08.519 --> 00:38:10.480
to make Peng Le Xuan grow bigger and bigger.

00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.199
Impossible. Absolutely impossible.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:16.000
Why?

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.320
Don't you realize

00:38:18.559 --> 00:38:20.480
this means I have to admit with my own mouth

00:38:20.480 --> 00:38:21.800
that all my previous investments

00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:22.840
were failures?

00:38:23.159 --> 00:38:24.800
All the work I did was pointless

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:25.840
and wrong.

00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:29.239
How can I survive in this circle if I do that?

00:38:29.440 --> 00:38:31.599
How can I gain the trust of everyone above and below?

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:35.360
You, as long as you succeed once,

00:38:35.559 --> 00:38:37.719
people will forget all your past failures.

00:38:37.719 --> 00:38:38.400
Understand?

00:38:38.679 --> 00:38:39.960
Alright, you don't need to say more.

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:41.880
Get out of the car.

00:38:42.119 --> 00:38:43.880
We won't be cooperating anymore in the future.

00:38:54.599 --> 00:38:55.639
What a coincidence.

00:38:56.119 --> 00:38:57.480
You two are together.

00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:02.800
Let me tell you a little secret.

00:39:04.119 --> 00:39:05.199
Actually, Weiguo

00:39:05.199 --> 00:39:07.519
is a mole planted among you.

00:39:07.639 --> 00:39:08.920
All the discord between you these days

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.440
was deliberately stirred up by him.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:12.519
And the matter with Chef Sun

00:39:12.519 --> 00:39:14.000
was also arranged by him on purpose.

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:15.679
He even guaranteed me

00:39:15.679 --> 00:39:17.599
that he could definitely get Peng Le Xuan for me.

00:39:18.679 --> 00:39:19.639
Oh, that thing?

00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.519
I already knew about that.

00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:24.159
He confessed to me yesterday.

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:28.639
I'll get out.

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.199
What did I tell you?

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:02.880
If you treat her like this,

00:40:03.480 --> 00:40:04.559
how could she cooperate with you?

00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.800
I've also expressed my stance to Mom and Dad.

00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.159
It's for your work.

00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:34.800
Just stay in Xi'an for one more year.

00:40:35.079 --> 00:40:36.679
Once you get promoted to director,

00:40:36.679 --> 00:40:38.639
you'll be the biggest official in our family.

00:40:38.639 --> 00:40:39.760
What?

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.599
What kind of official is that?

00:40:41.920 --> 00:40:43.000
You're just talking nonsense.

00:40:43.719 --> 00:40:46.400
Anyway, just go for it with single-minded focus.

00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.880
I'll support you from behind.

00:40:48.519 --> 00:40:51.880
You said Big Brother used to be so laid-back,

00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:53.280
but now he's working so hard.

00:40:53.599 --> 00:40:55.079
I need to learn from him.

00:40:55.079 --> 00:40:56.920
Yes, I also need to learn from Big Brother.

00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:57.760
Honey,

00:40:58.440 --> 00:41:00.000
look at you brothers.

00:41:00.599 --> 00:41:02.679
Third Brother is in charge of major decisions.

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.320
Second Brother secures investments.

00:41:04.639 --> 00:41:07.360
Big Brother recently won the Roast Duck King title.

00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:09.519
They're all indispensable to the roast duck shop.

00:41:10.639 --> 00:41:12.360
So you also need to think carefully

00:41:12.360 --> 00:41:13.920
about your role and position.

00:41:15.119 --> 00:41:17.239
Only then can you demonstrate your value.

00:41:18.559 --> 00:41:19.800
Yes, yes.
