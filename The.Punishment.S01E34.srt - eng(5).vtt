00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:44.750
If you come back

00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:46.600
to hurt him

00:14:47.150 --> 00:14:48.000
or kill him,

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.910
then his family will seek revenge.

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:53.750
When will this fighting end?

00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:57.390
Do you really want Wenxuan to wake up

00:14:58.440 --> 00:15:00.100
and not even be able to see you?

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:06.360
Peng.

00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.440
We've been relatives for so many years.

00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.000
Just now when you didn't open that door,

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.510
I was actually relieved.

00:15:14.870 --> 00:15:15.550
Really.

00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:19.880
Your conscience isn't gone after all.

00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:22.270
You haven't become like those people

00:15:22.270 --> 00:15:23.330
who've gone crazy.

00:15:31.670 --> 00:15:32.360
Peng.

00:15:35.120 --> 00:15:36.980
Wenxuan is still in the hospital.

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.600
You absolutely cannot
make any more mistakes.

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.550
I'm not a qualified father.

00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:47.270
I thought

00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.440
earning enough money

00:15:50.370 --> 00:15:51.770
and paving the way for him

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.450
meant I had fulfilled my responsibility.

00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:01.270
But it's not.

00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:13.200
We still have a chance.

00:16:14.910 --> 00:16:16.710
All of this will eventually end.

00:16:17.750 --> 00:16:18.750
Don't lose heart.

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:21.200
There's no chance anymore.

00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:23.960
This is my fate.

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:28.030
No chance left.

00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:31.120
Wenxuan will eventually wake up,

00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.150
right?

00:16:35.030 --> 00:16:37.690
So many people at home
are still waiting for you.

00:16:38.870 --> 00:16:40.130
Why is there no chance?

00:16:42.150 --> 00:16:43.610
As long as we make changes,

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.640
as long as we take a step forward,

00:16:46.770 --> 00:16:48.030
there will be a chance.

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:04.349
I don't know where to start.

00:17:05.510 --> 00:17:06.640
Let's start with

00:17:07.750 --> 00:17:09.790
the accident at the port project.

00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:12.400
Over there,

00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.099
how many people died in total?

00:17:18.750 --> 00:17:19.480
Three.

00:17:20.150 --> 00:17:21.680
So what did they do about it?

00:17:22.440 --> 00:17:23.589
After the accident,

00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:26.319
we immediately

00:17:27.440 --> 00:17:29.300
went to settle with the families.

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.180
Those who could be silenced,

00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.790
we shut them up.

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:37.630
Those who couldn't be silenced,

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:41.790
we shut them up anyway.

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:45.060
Uncle Limin and Chen Shuifa

00:17:46.470 --> 00:17:47.470
took money

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.530
to grease palms up and down.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:51.850
But unexpectedly,

00:17:53.990 --> 00:17:56.250
there was this accident with Feng Jiang.

00:18:00.510 --> 00:18:02.370
How much was Liu Tianye involved?

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:07.220
Tianye knew about
the faulty materials long ago,

00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.150
but he didn't do anything about it.

00:18:10.030 --> 00:18:11.360
He was just waiting for

00:18:11.390 --> 00:18:12.920
Zhang Xin to make a mistake.

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:15.520
Only if Zhang Xin made a mistake

00:18:16.610 --> 00:18:19.010
would he have a chance
to take her position.

00:18:31.830 --> 00:18:33.400
Is he really going to trade so many lives

00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.060
for a single chance of his own?

00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.290
He doesn't care
how many people die at all.

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.500
Your brother changed a long time ago.

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.490
He's already one of the elites now.

00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:46.620
But he's still not satisfied.

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:48.850
He wants to kick everyone

00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:50.350
off the table.

00:18:51.810 --> 00:18:53.270
He wants it all to himself.

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:56.240
He wants to be the one and only king

00:18:56.240 --> 00:18:57.360
of Hanzhou.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:58.590
A king.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.070
He traded all those lives for nothing

00:19:02.070 --> 00:19:04.470
more than
kicking everyone else off the table.

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:06.470
What kind of king does that make him?

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:09.480
In the end, all he's doing
is taking Zhang Xin's place,

00:19:09.480 --> 00:19:11.680
becoming the biggest crime boss of all.

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:15.100
Fine.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.200
He wants to kick everyone off the table.

00:19:20.420 --> 00:19:22.750
Will the people above even recognize him?

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:25.120
Who is this boss anyway?

00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:29.340
I don't know.

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:34.000
They all communicate
through separate channels.

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:51.650
Uncle Tianye,

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.610
Uncle Peng and Uncle Feng have met.

00:19:53.650 --> 00:19:54.880
That means they've reached a deal.

00:19:54.880 --> 00:19:56.340
We can't let them get away.

00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:57.520
Then what should I do now?

00:19:57.520 --> 00:19:59.380
Make the move and bring them back.

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.160
Wenxuan is still in Tianyun Hospital.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.340
Peng is worried about his safety.

00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:20.550
Find two people

00:20:21.030 --> 00:20:22.110
to go to Tianyun

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.440
and help Wenxuan

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:25.490
with his transfer paperwork.

00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.760
Take him to a safer hospital.

00:20:28.870 --> 00:20:30.070
I'll do it right away.

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:39.160
Peng.

00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:41.590
Don't worry.

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:44.510
I'll take care of Wenxuan's situation.

00:20:44.550 --> 00:20:46.000
You can count on me.

00:21:03.370 --> 00:21:04.050
Feng.

00:21:06.360 --> 00:21:07.380
I don't know

00:21:07.730 --> 00:21:09.460
if I'll ever see Wenxuan again.

00:21:10.270 --> 00:21:11.200
Please...

00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:13.390
Give it to him for me.

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.360
I'll keep it safe for now.

00:21:19.850 --> 00:21:20.680
Thank you.

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:23.250
Mentor.

00:21:23.310 --> 00:21:24.920
Zhao Peng has agreed to cooperate now.

00:21:24.920 --> 00:21:26.480
Now we can basically confirm

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:28.030
that the masterminds behind all this

00:21:28.030 --> 00:21:30.040
are Xinrui and Tianyun Group.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.680
Regarding Zhang Xin and Liu Tianye—

00:21:31.680 --> 00:21:33.160
all parties and all matters—

00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.200
Zhao Peng is willing
to testify and identify them.

00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:35.880
Good.

00:21:36.810 --> 00:21:38.610
Take him back to the hotel first.

00:21:39.510 --> 00:21:40.880
About the concealed information,

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:42.440
Feng Jiang can testify to that.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.370
But for the people behind all this,

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:46.810
only Zhao Peng can testify.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:49.030
As for the rest of the case,

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:50.630
I won't be involved anymore.

00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:53.100
You can request

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.350
to recuse yourself from the bureau.

00:21:54.350 --> 00:21:55.480
The remaining matters

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.680
will be handled by us.

00:21:57.380 --> 00:21:57.940
Alright.

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:09.960
Uncle Tianye,

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:12.480
the security cameras might have caught me.

00:23:28.790 --> 00:23:29.820
Liu Tianye,

00:23:30.030 --> 00:23:31.530
have you lost your mind?

00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:34.590
Are you all insane?

00:23:35.380 --> 00:23:37.230
Feng was in the car.

00:23:37.750 --> 00:23:39.550
Your brother was in the car!

00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.400
What did you tell him?

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.110
What did I tell him?

00:23:55.270 --> 00:23:56.550
I told him everything.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.570
I told him everything

00:24:01.550 --> 00:24:03.010
we've done over the years.

00:24:03.270 --> 00:24:04.030
Peng,

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.750
Zhang Xin deliberately leaked
Feng Jiang's information to you.

00:24:08.750 --> 00:24:10.440
You've been tricked by that woman!

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.750
That's right, Peng.

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:14.680
This is her trap.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.790
She just wants to direct the heat onto us.

00:24:16.790 --> 00:24:19.580
How can you not see it?

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:24.440
Peng,

00:24:26.270 --> 00:24:27.480
leave.

00:24:27.570 --> 00:24:29.480
I'm begging you, please.

00:24:31.280 --> 00:24:32.790
We want you to leave

00:24:33.790 --> 00:24:35.740
because we want to save you.

00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.540
What's there to save about me?

00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:44.640
I'm beyond saving.

00:24:54.830 --> 00:24:56.400
The police want me dead.

00:24:59.110 --> 00:25:00.790
Zhang Xin wants me dead.

00:25:02.790 --> 00:25:04.110
Do you want me dead too?

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:14.680
I don't want you dead.

00:25:16.550 --> 00:25:18.400
I want to redeem myself.

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:21.710
You all need redemption too.

00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:23.960
You've hurt so many people.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.440
You should be punished.

00:25:29.070 --> 00:25:30.160
Tianye,

00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:32.510
turn back.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:36.080
There will be consequences.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:55.960
Peng.

00:25:57.110 --> 00:25:57.880
Peng!

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:45.510
Tianye.

00:27:46.250 --> 00:27:47.350
I hope

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:50.070
you'll never have to use this gun.

00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.770
Captain Qin, you're awake.

00:28:00.840 --> 00:28:01.900
Where's Zhao Peng?

00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:03.480
Still searching for him.

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.610
We've issued an APB.

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:08.830
And we've confirmed
Ding Baoshuai was at the scene.

00:28:08.830 --> 00:28:10.630
We're conducting a wide search.

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.070
I tried to contact him.

00:28:12.070 --> 00:28:12.920
He didn't respond.

00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.250
His phone is turned off.

00:28:20.070 --> 00:28:22.530
I shouldn't have let you
go after Feng Jiang.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:23.720
Captain Qin.

00:28:24.270 --> 00:28:26.000
Director Yan is away for training.

00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.200
Director Peng is temporarily in charge.

00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:28.830
Because of this incident,

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:30.310
Director Peng scolded Captain Zhong,

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:32.110
saying that in Zhao Peng's case,

00:28:32.470 --> 00:28:35.070
you neither reported it
nor recused yourself.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.610
If anyone asks,

00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.310
I'll just say the situation was urgent
and I had no time to report.

00:28:39.310 --> 00:28:40.920
I'll take responsibility for this.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.650
Take responsibility for what?

00:28:43.310 --> 00:28:44.640
-Captain Zhong.
-Captain Zhong.

00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:46.440
Do you think you can handle this?

00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:54.960
How are you feeling? Any better?

00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:58.760
The bureau just had a meeting
about promoting you to deputy captain,

00:41:31.230 --> 00:41:32.000
I know.

00:41:33.630 --> 00:41:35.160
Do you have any objections?

00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:37.110
Well.

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:41.190
I know we violated regulations.

00:41:41.190 --> 00:41:42.280
But shouldn't we

00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:44.230
wait until Captain Qin is discharged

00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:45.920
and everything is fully investigated

00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:47.380
before making a decision?

00:41:48.550 --> 00:41:50.590
Do you think our decision was hasty

00:41:50.590 --> 00:41:53.190
or you just feel frustrated?

00:41:54.670 --> 00:41:55.280
Director Peng.

00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:56.080
Stop talking.

00:41:56.150 --> 00:41:56.960
Let me finish.

00:42:00.190 --> 00:42:02.160
I was there with Captain Qin.

00:42:02.710 --> 00:42:04.710
I understand the situation
better than most.

00:42:04.710 --> 00:42:05.880
Since Captain Qin isn't here,

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:07.480
I want to speak on his behalf.

00:42:08.150 --> 00:42:10.000
Actually, when we went there,
we anticipated

00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.940
something like this might happen.

00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:14.040
But we believed

00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:16.210
for the sake of the case,

00:42:16.590 --> 00:42:18.050
the risk was worth taking.

00:42:18.230 --> 00:42:19.400
And we were proven right.

00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:20.600
We broke Zhao Peng.

00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:22.290
There was just an accident.

00:42:22.590 --> 00:42:23.450
What's the use?

00:42:24.590 --> 00:42:25.760
Well. What's the point

00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:27.190
of explaining all this to me now?

00:42:27.190 --> 00:42:29.230
I can only look at the results.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:31.200
And what are the results?

00:42:32.470 --> 00:42:33.590
Come on, tell me.

00:42:37.030 --> 00:42:38.490
But we can't just overturn

00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.150
all of Captain Qin's past efforts

00:42:41.150 --> 00:42:42.880
because of the results, can we?

00:42:43.230 --> 00:42:45.030
If that's how you want to play it,

00:42:45.510 --> 00:42:47.280
then none of us should do anything.

00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:48.230
If we do nothing, we won't make mistakes.

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:49.280
Stop talking.

00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:51.440
Zeng Xu.

00:42:51.670 --> 00:42:53.470
Your reflection was pointless.

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:55.920
And I suppose your self-criticism
was also a waste, wasn't it?

00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:57.000
You completely fail to realize

00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.800
the severity of this situation.

00:42:58.960 --> 00:42:59.880
Get out now

00:43:00.030 --> 00:43:01.070
and write a new self-criticism.

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:02.230
No less than 10,000 words.

00:43:02.230 --> 00:43:04.360
You must deeply reflect on your actions.

00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:05.000
Bian Jing.

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:05.760
Yes.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:06.960
Go with him and supervise him.

00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:07.550
Yes, sir.

00:43:08.110 --> 00:43:08.640
Let's go.

00:43:09.110 --> 00:43:09.640
Let's go.

00:43:11.230 --> 00:43:12.090
Director Peng.

00:43:12.550 --> 00:43:14.680
I want to make my position clear to you.

00:43:15.430 --> 00:43:16.670
For something like this to happen,

00:43:16.670 --> 00:43:16.690
the responsibility lies first with me.

00:43:16.690 --> 00:43:17.480
[Hanzhou Public Security]

00:43:17.480 --> 00:43:19.030
I failed to manage properly.

00:43:19.030 --> 00:43:20.440
I will make a thorough self-examination.

00:43:20.440 --> 00:43:23.230
Our Criminal Investigation Unit
will definitely learn from this lesson

00:43:23.230 --> 00:43:25.510
and conduct deep reflection and analysis.

00:43:25.510 --> 00:43:27.510
We will firmly prevent
similar incidents from happening again.
