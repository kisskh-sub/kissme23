WEBVTT

00:01:43.439 --> 00:01:44.239
You're a girl.

00:01:44.239 --> 00:01:45.239
Can't you be a bit more reserved?

00:01:45.879 --> 00:01:46.879
I want to help you.

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:48.400
If you want to help me, stay away from me.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.359
Stop following me around.

00:01:50.079 --> 00:01:52.120
Ma Weiguo, you don't have much time.

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:53.120
You need to come with me to see a doctor, now.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:54.400
Do you like me or something?

00:01:57.760 --> 00:01:59.079
What? What did you say?

00:02:00.319 --> 00:02:01.560
If you're not serious...

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.519
...then stay away from me.

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:03.519
Stop following me.

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:04.760
Otherwise, people might get the wrong idea.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.480
You know?

00:02:08.319 --> 00:02:09.199
So what if they misunderstand?

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.280
Let them misunderstand.

00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.360
Just stop following me.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.719
Director Dong came to pick you up personally?

00:02:34.719 --> 00:02:36.400
The meeting starts in ten minutes.

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:37.840
You still have a chance.

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.759
Do you want me to look over your proposal?

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.120
No.

00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:42.639
That confident, huh?

00:04:18.879 --> 00:04:20.560
What took you so long?

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:21.959
How did it go?

00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:28.680
It didn't work out.

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:31.519
You...

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:34.000
...are too proud for your own good.

00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.240
I told you I'd help you.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:37.240
But you just had to refuse.

00:04:37.639 --> 00:04:39.000
Alright, let's not talk about this.

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:40.240
Let's eat first.

00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:42.120
You still have an appetite?

00:04:42.759 --> 00:04:44.439
This morning you promised me...

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:45.439
...it was definitely going to work.

00:04:45.439 --> 00:04:46.920
You even said we'd come here to celebrate.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.120
And now? Nothing worked out.

00:04:57.079 --> 00:04:58.399
Li Lianbao!

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:01.240
Are you... are you messing with me?

00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:02.600
You're messing with me, aren't you?

00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:03.399
Ow, ow, ow!

00:05:03.399 --> 00:05:04.240
What kind of time is this?

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.120
And you have the nerve to mess with me?

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.319
I've been worried sick here!

00:05:06.399 --> 00:05:07.240
Waiter!

00:05:07.399 --> 00:05:09.319
You can serve the meal I ordered.

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:11.000
No, tell me quickly.

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:12.240
How did the talk go?

00:05:12.439 --> 00:05:13.759
We're still talking about it?

00:05:13.839 --> 00:05:15.439
We talked all afternoon.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.680
Look at this elegant setting.

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:20.519
Such a romantic atmosphere.

00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:22.120
Can we not talk about work?

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:26.319
Sir, the red wine you ordered.

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:30.959
To our pleasant cooperation.

00:05:30.959 --> 00:05:32.319
Cheers.

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:34.399
Hey, why aren't you drinking?

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.600
I have gout, you know.

00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:37.680
I better not drink.

00:05:37.879 --> 00:05:39.319
I'll toast with water.

00:05:39.439 --> 00:05:42.480
To a smooth partnership.

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:44.959
Well, in that case, I won't drink either.

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.240
That won't do.

00:05:46.319 --> 00:05:48.160
This is such a day for celebration.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.519
How can you not drink?

00:05:52.399 --> 00:05:53.319
Fine, I'll drink.

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:55.759
Bottoms up.

00:06:00.839 --> 00:06:02.160
You're only drinking that much?

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:04.439
That's not acceptable.

00:06:04.439 --> 00:06:05.800
You should at least finish that.

00:06:05.959 --> 00:06:06.519
Wait a minute.

00:06:06.680 --> 00:06:07.879
You're drinking water, I'm drinking wine.

00:06:07.879 --> 00:06:09.600
Why should I have to finish mine right away?

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:10.399
It's different.

00:06:10.839 --> 00:06:13.240
Isn't this a happy occasion?

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:14.879
So I think your first glass...

00:06:14.959 --> 00:06:16.120
...must be finished.

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:18.160
I see you're quite the smooth talker.

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:19.839
Down the hatch, down the hatch.

00:06:20.439 --> 00:06:21.600
That's more like it.

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.000
Here, let me pour you another.

00:06:26.759 --> 00:06:28.160
Slow down, don't pour so much.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.240
You're not even drinking.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.120
Just pour it first.

00:06:30.959 --> 00:06:31.800
Hey, you...

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.959
...you're not up to something again, are you?

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:35.439
Me?

00:06:35.879 --> 00:06:37.439
What could I possibly be up to?

00:06:37.439 --> 00:06:38.759
Come on, eat something.

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:51.480
What did you want to tell me?

00:06:56.519 --> 00:06:57.439
Nothing.

00:07:01.079 --> 00:07:02.480
I just wanted to tell you...

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.160
...that I like you.

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.680
And...

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:09.560
...I've liked you since the first time I saw you.

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.279
I never thought I'd see you again.

00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:29.159
Even though you've said nothing...

00:09:31.440 --> 00:09:33.759
...I can see it in your eyes.

00:09:34.799 --> 00:09:37.919
You must have many stories about Beijing.

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:40.799
And I can also feel...

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.720
...that you like me too.

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.399
You still don't understand men.

00:09:51.039 --> 00:09:52.200
You're the one who's not being honest.

00:09:52.200 --> 00:09:53.759
You're not facing your own feelings.

00:09:58.039 --> 00:10:00.440
You always pretend to be so strong.

00:10:03.039 --> 00:10:03.919
But in my eyes...

00:10:03.919 --> 00:10:05.600
...you've always been a coward.

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:07.039
Over twenty years ago...

00:10:07.279 --> 00:10:09.399
...you had a falling out with your brothers.

00:10:09.559 --> 00:10:10.919
So you ran off abroad.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.240
More than twenty years later...

00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.039
...you got sick and ran back here.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.840
Pretending...

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.919
...you're above fighting the illness.

00:10:18.039 --> 00:10:19.320
And right now, at this moment...

00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.039
...you still want to run away.

00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:24.159
I think you overestimate yourself.

00:10:24.159 --> 00:10:25.919
Don't kid yourself so much.

00:10:25.919 --> 00:10:26.519
Is that so?

00:10:26.519 --> 00:10:27.080
Yes.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.720
I said...

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:42.200
...starting tonight...

00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.279
...I won't care about you anymore.

00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:44.600
Do whatever you want.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.200
And me saying I'm going back is a lie too.

00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:48.039
I won't...

00:10:48.039 --> 00:10:49.840
...run away just because my confession failed.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:20.639
Chinese.

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:23.080
Chinese.

00:12:23.679 --> 00:12:25.440
What a coincidence, running into you again.

00:12:33.279 --> 00:12:34.759
Over twenty years ago...

00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:37.360
...you had a falling out with your brothers.

00:12:37.519 --> 00:12:38.840
So you ran off abroad.

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:40.360
And right now, at this moment...

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:42.120
...you still want to run away.

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.159
Give it to me.

00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:04.000
What?

00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:05.200
Your car keys.

00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:05.960
I'll drive you.

00:13:06.080 --> 00:13:07.960
No need, I'll just get a designated driver.

00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:08.960
That won't do.

00:13:08.960 --> 00:13:10.960
You've been drinking, and you're a woman.

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:11.720
It's not safe.

00:13:11.720 --> 00:13:12.600
Really, it's fine.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.720
I can just get a driver and go home.

00:13:13.720 --> 00:13:15.080
No, no, no, give them to me.

00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:17.519
I'll take you.

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:18.960
Get in the car, quick.

00:13:19.279 --> 00:13:21.600
I should be more wary of you than anyone else.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.639
Get in. Take it easy.

00:13:32.159 --> 00:13:32.799
Let me do it.

00:13:59.279 --> 00:14:01.320
I remember one time when we were kids.

00:14:01.639 --> 00:14:03.480
We went to Houhai together to play.

00:14:04.840 --> 00:14:06.200
Big Brother and I...

00:14:06.399 --> 00:14:08.360
Weiguo and Qiu'er were having a water fight.

00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.639
They thought because you were a girl...

00:14:11.639 --> 00:14:12.720
They wouldn't let you play.

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.080
I saw you...

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:16.720
Crying out of anger on the shore.

00:14:17.799 --> 00:14:20.039
I couldn't bring myself to go comfort you then.

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:25.320
Later, I noticed there were lotus flowers on the water.

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.480
So I thought, behind the guys' backs...

00:14:27.639 --> 00:14:29.639
I'd secretly pick one to give to you.

00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:32.840
But you have no idea what happened.

00:14:32.840 --> 00:14:34.840
The surface of the water looked fine.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.600
But underneath, it was full of water weeds.

00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:39.480
I had just swum halfway...

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:41.200
When I got tangled in those weeds.

00:14:41.720 --> 00:14:44.320
The more I struggled, the deeper I sank.

00:14:45.320 --> 00:14:47.000
I was scared to death at the time.

00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.200
But later on...

00:14:50.399 --> 00:14:52.679
When I presented that lotus flower to you...

00:14:52.879 --> 00:14:54.120
And I looked at you...

00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:56.200
You were smiling so happily.

00:14:57.360 --> 00:14:58.840
Then I felt that...

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000
Taking that bit of risk was worth it.

00:15:03.639 --> 00:15:04.639
Thinking about it now...

00:15:04.879 --> 00:15:07.679
I really must have liked you back then.

00:15:08.639 --> 00:15:11.559
So you started having a crush on me when you were little.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:16.320
You said the first time was an accident.

00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:17.840
This time doesn't count, right?

00:15:18.279 --> 00:15:20.080
So from now on, can we...

00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:22.200
Just be how we were before...

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:23.600
And stay that way in the future?

00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:29.080
What do you mean?

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.639
Just like before?

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:35.080
Let's not mention what happened anymore.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.960
You know we're both already quite tired.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:40.639
I don't want the relationship between us...

00:15:40.639 --> 00:15:41.720
To become more complicated.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:44.480
No, you were the one who initiated it this time.

00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:46.480
Then just pretend I was drunk.

00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.080
But you were sober at the time.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.639
You don't actually want me to take responsibility, do you?

00:15:51.639 --> 00:15:52.480
I am not that kind of...

00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.720
Irresponsible scumbag.

00:15:53.840 --> 00:15:54.720
Look...

00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.279
The misunderstanding about the love letter is cleared up.

00:15:57.639 --> 00:15:59.639
And now, regarding Peng Le Xuan and your company...

00:15:59.639 --> 00:16:00.840
The cooperation deal...

00:16:00.840 --> 00:16:01.960
I've resolved that too.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.840
So about the two of us...

00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.960
Can't we seriously consider it?

00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:15.200
Lianbao.

00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:17.960
We've all grown up now.

00:16:18.720 --> 00:16:19.960
I think...

00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:21.720
The Dong Qian you like...

00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:23.960
Is the me from childhood.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.720
Not the me of today.

00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:28.679
I can't go back.

00:16:29.120 --> 00:16:30.279
And you can't go back either.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.480
It's okay.

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:07.559
These accounts are actually pretty good.

00:17:08.880 --> 00:17:10.720
This kind of video is the hottest right now.

00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:12.839
If we want to run this account...

00:17:12.839 --> 00:17:14.839
And want it to take off quickly...

00:17:15.319 --> 00:17:16.960
Besides combining it with your Duck King persona...

00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:18.079
We have to do what they do.

00:17:18.079 --> 00:17:19.960
We need to weave in some fun plots.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:23.640
No, this is too scripted.

00:17:24.319 --> 00:17:25.519
Look at this getup...

00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:27.480
And the content they're making...

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:29.440
It's just like acting in a skit.

00:17:29.759 --> 00:17:32.240
I still want to just honestly...

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.079
Record the life inside the Hutongs.

00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.480
I get that.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:38.240
But...

00:17:38.960 --> 00:17:41.839
If you want to purely record life...

00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:44.480
And also want to be like them...

00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:47.200
Attracting lots of likes and comments...

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.480
That's very hard.

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:48.920
No...

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.960
The main thing is I really don't like this style, you know?

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:51.599
Understood.

00:17:52.240 --> 00:17:53.559
Doesn't Second Uncle know a bit about this?

00:17:53.559 --> 00:17:54.160
Ask him.

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.359
No, no, asking your Second Uncle is useless.

00:17:56.359 --> 00:17:56.960
Let me tell you...

00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.359
Once you mention this to your Second Uncle...

00:17:58.359 --> 00:17:59.359
He'll just talk to you about...

00:17:59.359 --> 00:18:00.799
How to gain followers...

00:18:00.799 --> 00:18:02.799
How to beg for follows...

00:18:02.799 --> 00:18:04.000
And begging for likes.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:05.200
His mind is full of that stuff.

00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.000
He'll end up brainwashing me, I'm telling you.

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:09.559
Then ask Uncle Qiu'er.

00:18:11.279 --> 00:18:12.240
Uncle Qiu'er...

00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:13.440
I'll ask your Uncle Qiu'er.

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:14.440
He's quite fashionable.

00:18:14.720 --> 00:18:16.079
It's not a matter of being fashionable.

00:18:16.079 --> 00:18:17.480
It's mainly that if he chats with me...

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:19.200
I can remember a lot of things from the past.

00:18:19.200 --> 00:18:21.720
He has some good story points...

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.440
Or if we talk about something...

00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:25.480
I might recall something useful.

00:18:28.440 --> 00:18:30.960
Qiu'er, what are you doing? Are you busy?

00:18:31.119 --> 00:18:32.079
If you're not busy...

00:18:32.079 --> 00:18:34.720
I'll come over and chat for a bit.

00:18:36.119 --> 00:18:37.440
Instant reply.

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.000
One word: Busy.

00:18:44.599 --> 00:18:46.920
I'll go chat with your Third Uncle then.

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:48.839
Okay.

00:18:49.359 --> 00:18:50.480
Go to bed early.

00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:51.200
Okay, okay.

00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:53.039
You're going now?

00:18:53.319 --> 00:18:54.079
I'm going right now.

00:18:54.079 --> 00:18:55.720
Alright. I'll do some more research.

00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:32.720
Still haven't rested?

00:19:35.799 --> 00:19:36.480
I know...

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.200
You've always wanted to hold a photography exhibition.

00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.200
This is a friend of mine.

00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.319
You can contact him.

00:19:43.480 --> 00:19:44.559
He will help you arrange it.

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:53.480
I don't need it.

00:20:23.440 --> 00:20:24.599
What is this supposed to be?

00:20:25.240 --> 00:20:27.720
You feel sorry for me? Afraid of hurting me?

00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:28.839
Want to compensate me?

00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:30.440
I don't care what you think.

00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:32.039
I just want to help you.

00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:34.599
I said, I don't need it.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:36.680
Don't think just because you're a patient...

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.680
That I won't dare to scold you.

00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:38.920
If you really feel guilty...

00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:40.200
Then go get treated properly.

00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:42.119
I know my own body very well.

00:20:42.319 --> 00:20:43.920
Is this illness of mine a common one?

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.960
This is cancer. It's brain cancer.

00:20:46.119 --> 00:20:47.319
Is it that easy to cure?

00:20:47.319 --> 00:20:48.440
All said and done...

00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:50.559
You just want to wait for death here.

00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.720
I am not waiting for death.

00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:54.119
Since I came back...

00:20:54.559 --> 00:20:56.079
The things I should do, the things I wanted to do...

00:20:56.079 --> 00:20:57.039
I have already done them.

00:20:57.319 --> 00:20:58.839
It's best to just let nature take its course.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.200
I thank you for your kindness.

00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:03.319
But I don't have much time left.

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.359
I don't want to live in a pathetic state.

00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:07.000
And I don't want others to pity me.

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:08.519
Do you understand what I mean?

00:21:21.400 --> 00:21:22.240
I don't understand

00:21:57.079 --> 00:21:57.960
Wang Esq.

00:21:58.799 --> 00:21:59.480
Martin

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.720
There's progress on the fund unfreezing.

00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.680
You need to come back personally to handle it.

00:22:03.839 --> 00:22:05.079
When can you come back?

00:22:06.079 --> 00:22:08.079
I should be able to return in a few days.

00:22:08.079 --> 00:22:09.079
Great.

00:22:09.839 --> 00:22:12.079
I was afraid you'd say things weren't finished yet

00:22:12.079 --> 00:22:13.359
and didn't want to come back.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.359
Things aren't finished.

00:22:17.720 --> 00:22:18.680
But

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.000
it might not be convenient for me to stay here anymore.

00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:23.359
Alright, I'll make arrangements for you.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.440
Thanks.

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:16.559
This Penglexuan is really gaining momentum.

00:23:18.960 --> 00:23:20.240
Look at this area.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:22.720
Is there any chance for us to collaborate?

00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:26.319
I gave you a chance before, you didn't want it.

00:23:26.799 --> 00:23:28.200
Now it's not so easy.

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.240
A great man doesn't bear grudges against lesser men.

00:23:30.759 --> 00:23:31.240
Come on.

00:23:31.319 --> 00:23:31.839
Come on.

00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:32.680
Let's have a drink.

00:23:37.240 --> 00:23:38.480
Li Lianbao.

00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:40.359
It really is you.

00:23:42.680 --> 00:23:43.720
You are?

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:45.960
I'm Xiao Wu, used to follow Brother Ma.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:48.720
You had a run-in with me before.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:58.960
What's up?

00:23:59.039 --> 00:24:00.559
Want to revisit old scores?

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:01.599
If you say so.

00:24:02.039 --> 00:24:03.559
I'll revisit those old scores with you.

00:24:03.559 --> 00:24:06.240
People in this world are wicked.

00:24:06.599 --> 00:24:08.759
It's really different from when we were kids.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:11.200
Back then, things were straightforward.

00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:13.200
There weren't so many ill intentions.

00:24:13.440 --> 00:24:15.319
That was all just horseplay.

00:24:15.839 --> 00:24:17.480
But I lost a brother.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:18.480
Lianbao.

00:24:18.759 --> 00:24:20.519
Let me state upfront,

00:24:20.599 --> 00:24:22.920
that day, right off the bat, I got knocked out.

00:24:22.920 --> 00:24:24.039
It had nothing to do with me.

00:24:25.519 --> 00:24:27.000
Hey, Lianbao.

00:24:27.559 --> 00:24:30.559
What about that guy, Ma Weiguo?

00:24:30.759 --> 00:24:33.200
That guy really had your back.

00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:34.039
Pretty righteous.

00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:35.720
What do you mean?

00:24:37.119 --> 00:24:37.799
You...

00:24:40.319 --> 00:24:43.319
Back then, Brother Ma liked Dong Qian, right?

00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:46.079
Darn it, you had to get so close to Dong Qian.

00:24:46.240 --> 00:24:48.759
Brother Ma was determined to find you, you know?

00:24:49.240 --> 00:24:50.279
Later, Ma Weiguo

00:24:50.279 --> 00:24:51.759
somehow got wind of it.

00:24:51.839 --> 00:24:53.359
The guy came by himself.

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.000
He came looking for Brother Ma.

00:24:55.079 --> 00:24:57.680
Said he wanted to mediate between you.

00:24:58.119 --> 00:25:00.400
So that fight was because of me.

00:25:00.400 --> 00:25:01.759
Definitely because of you.

00:25:01.759 --> 00:25:04.000
That fight happened because of you.

00:25:06.839 --> 00:25:08.920
Think about it, he came to see Brother Ma.

00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.680
Brother Ma was such a jerk.

00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:13.119
Grabbed a bottle and smashed it on his head.

00:25:13.440 --> 00:25:14.640
This Ma Weiguo,

00:25:15.519 --> 00:25:17.000
the guy just took it.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:19.000
Didn't even blink.

00:25:19.279 --> 00:25:22.079
Stunned Brother Ma on the spot.

00:25:24.519 --> 00:25:26.279
Then you guys showed up, right?

00:25:26.319 --> 00:25:28.079
Darn it, then everyone started brawling.

00:25:28.079 --> 00:25:29.839
No one knew who hit who.

00:25:29.839 --> 00:25:31.279
To this day, I took that hit

00:25:31.279 --> 00:25:32.640
and I don't even know who to blame.

00:25:33.559 --> 00:25:34.799
Lianbao, Lianbao.

00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:35.759
Look.

00:25:35.759 --> 00:25:37.319
Someday when you see your brothers,

00:25:37.319 --> 00:25:38.160
let's all get together

00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:39.799
and have a proper drink, okay?

00:25:39.799 --> 00:25:40.519
My treat.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:47.000
Ma Weiguo,

00:25:54.759 --> 00:25:57.279
Big Brother, Lianbao, Qiu'er.

00:25:57.559 --> 00:26:00.000
Let's find some time to go out together.

00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:01.559
Consider it a team-building trip.

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.119
Brothers, I'm sorry.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:09.519
It seems in this lifetime, I can never face you directly.

00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.960
Can't be as optimistic as you.

00:26:12.440 --> 00:26:15.160
Can't see through everything early like you did.

00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.599
Accept that I was meant to be ordinary.

00:26:18.599 --> 00:26:19.880
Even today,

00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:22.599
you're still willing to indulge my affectations.

00:26:23.119 --> 00:26:24.640
Even without stopping your complaints.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:26.920
Thank you.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:48.960
Qiu'er.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:49.920
Uh, hey.

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:51.359
You, you sit in the front.

00:26:51.359 --> 00:26:52.880
I'll sit in the back with Weiguo.

00:26:53.079 --> 00:26:54.200
You, sit over there.

00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:04.200
Second Brother, don't drive yet.

00:27:05.359 --> 00:27:06.119
Here, Weiguo.

00:27:06.119 --> 00:27:08.119
Uh, drink this soup first.

00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:09.119
No, but...

00:27:09.119 --> 00:27:10.200
Big Brother, I've had breakfast.

00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:10.880
I can't drink it.

00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.960
Just drink it if I tell you to.

00:27:13.319 --> 00:27:15.599
No, this... I'll give it to the restaurant.

00:27:15.759 --> 00:27:17.680
It's a newly developed health tonic soup.

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:19.079
Just consider it taste-testing.

00:27:19.480 --> 00:27:20.720
Come on, drink it all.

00:27:21.359 --> 00:27:23.119
Alright, I really can't drink anymore.

00:27:23.119 --> 00:27:24.160
Don't leave any.

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.559
You, drink it all, all of it.

00:27:26.559 --> 00:27:28.039
Yeah, just drink it.

00:27:28.119 --> 00:27:29.640
See how much Big Brother favors you?

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:30.680
I want to drink it but can't even get any.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.880
You want some? Here, you drink it.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:32.559
No, no, no.

00:27:32.559 --> 00:27:34.200
Stop messing around, will you?

00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.319
No, if you want to drink it,

00:27:35.319 --> 00:27:36.279
I'll make another pot for you later.

00:27:36.279 --> 00:27:37.880
This suits his constitution.

00:27:38.440 --> 00:27:39.200
Drink it all.

00:27:42.559 --> 00:27:44.279
Wait, where are we going?

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.640
Drive east, I'll give you directions.

00:27:49.559 --> 00:27:50.680
I can't drink anymore, Big Brother.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:51.440
No, just drink it.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.440
I made such a big pot.

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.039
It was the last batch.

00:27:53.039 --> 00:27:54.400
This is all the essence. Hurry up.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.440
Taste-testing this early? My goodness.

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:57.640
Drink it quickly.

00:27:57.759 --> 00:27:59.920
Let's leave early. Come on.

00:28:01.319 --> 00:28:02.680
Alright, he's drinking too much. Later,

00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.039
there'll be nowhere to use the bathroom.

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.920
That's enough now. It's fine.

00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:07.720
Is that okay, Big Brother?

00:28:08.359 --> 00:28:09.640
Let's go. Let's get going.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.359
There's still so much left.

00:28:11.359 --> 00:28:12.559
That's enough, Big Brother.

00:28:58.240 --> 00:28:59.000
Let me help you.

00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.079
It's fine, I can manage.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.200
Hey, Weiguo.

00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:02.640
Let me take that.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:02.960
It's fine.

00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:04.079
Why'd you come all the way out here?

00:29:04.079 --> 00:29:04.680
Not bad.

00:29:06.079 --> 00:29:06.839
Alright.

00:29:07.079 --> 00:29:08.119
Since we're already here.

00:29:08.119 --> 00:29:09.119
Penglexuan is about to open too.

00:29:09.119 --> 00:29:10.440
Let's just treat it as a team-building event.

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:10.759
No, give it to me.

00:29:10.759 --> 00:29:11.519
And to build up this...

00:29:11.519 --> 00:29:12.599
It's fine, we can.

00:29:12.599 --> 00:29:13.440
Team spirit.

00:29:14.839 --> 00:29:17.000
If it's team-building, couldn't we go to a proper place?

00:29:17.319 --> 00:29:19.240
What can we even do out here in the middle of nowhere?

00:29:19.599 --> 00:29:22.119
No, look, Weiguo's overseas.

00:29:22.119 --> 00:29:23.839
He's got a family and a career there, right?

00:29:23.839 --> 00:29:25.440
He's taking the time to be with us.

00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:27.119
Just go along with what he wants.

00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.640
Look at that little duckling over there.

00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:30.880
Is that a duck? That's a goose.

00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:31.920
Stewed goose in an iron pot.

00:29:32.519 --> 00:29:33.519
Give me the stuff.

00:29:40.839 --> 00:29:42.319
Do you know something?

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:44.759
Weiguo.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:46.920
I know you.

00:29:47.359 --> 00:29:49.000
No, you're on your own?

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.000
Don't tell them.

00:29:50.240 --> 00:29:51.839
Keep it a secret for me, okay?

00:29:52.759 --> 00:29:54.279
You know, the environment here isn't bad.

00:29:54.559 --> 00:29:55.279
Isn't it though?

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.480
Weiguo, what's the plan?

00:29:59.119 --> 00:30:00.039
Remember?

00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.440
We all came here when we were kids.

00:30:01.559 --> 00:30:02.359
We did?

00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:05.440
There used to be a pulley on this well.

00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:05.960
Right.

00:30:06.359 --> 00:30:09.079
And there was a swing here, I think.

00:30:10.720 --> 00:30:11.440
Remember?

00:30:12.359 --> 00:30:13.200
Gouya.

00:30:13.559 --> 00:30:15.519
I'm a bit hungry, actually. I'll have some first.

00:30:18.079 --> 00:30:19.000
Don't eat it all.

00:30:19.079 --> 00:30:20.200
It's for tomorrow.

00:30:20.319 --> 00:30:21.359
It won't tear open.

00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:24.519
Make some room.

00:30:26.079 --> 00:30:26.960
Still got some strength.

00:30:27.319 --> 00:30:27.920
Not bad.

00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:29.000
I won't kill you with it.

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.079
Let me assign tasks.

00:30:31.519 --> 00:30:32.680
Big Brother brings the meat tomorrow.

00:30:33.279 --> 00:30:34.720
Weiguo is in charge of drinks.

00:30:34.960 --> 00:30:36.559
I'll handle the main food and snacks.

00:30:37.519 --> 00:30:39.319
As for the grill and charcoal...

00:30:39.519 --> 00:30:41.319
Qiu'er, you can do it.

00:30:41.319 --> 00:30:41.920
Can do.

00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:42.720
Can do.

00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:44.440
No, this grill is super heavy.

00:30:44.519 --> 00:30:45.599
Qiu'er, can you even carry it?

00:30:45.599 --> 00:30:46.160
I can.

00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:47.079
Big Brother.

00:30:47.079 --> 00:30:48.599
Why do you always side with Qiu'er?

00:30:48.599 --> 00:30:50.359
No, he has to carry it.

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:51.839
Fine, I'll carry it.

00:30:51.839 --> 00:30:53.519
Big Brother, leave it to me.

00:30:53.519 --> 00:30:54.240
You're really something.

00:30:54.240 --> 00:30:54.880
Alright.

00:30:55.359 --> 00:30:55.960
Take it.

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:57.480
Here.

00:30:58.640 --> 00:31:00.079
To our spring outing tomorrow.

00:31:00.079 --> 00:31:00.640
Cheers.

00:31:00.839 --> 00:31:01.359
Cheers.

00:31:01.359 --> 00:31:02.000
Cheers.

00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:02.880
The Four Brothers of Baofang.

00:31:02.880 --> 00:31:03.599
The Four Brothers of Baofang.

00:31:03.599 --> 00:31:04.720
Invincible throughout the universe.

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:13.720
You're so slow.

00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:18.160
Overtaking on the curve.

00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.279
Where are we?

00:31:23.799 --> 00:31:24.799
Is this the place?

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:26.240
How is it?

00:31:26.799 --> 00:31:28.400
Nice environment, right?

00:31:32.119 --> 00:31:33.000
Darn it.

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:34.440
What's wrong?

00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:35.200
What happened?

00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.720
I mistook the bag with my dad's...

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.759
...the board for propping up flowerpots...

00:31:39.759 --> 00:31:40.920
...for the bag with the grill.

00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:41.759
The charcoal?

00:31:41.839 --> 00:31:43.000
Didn't bring that either.

00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:44.880
You're such an idiot.

00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.759
You can't even handle such a simple task.

00:31:46.759 --> 00:31:48.200
Just stop scolding him.

00:31:48.359 --> 00:31:49.240
You too.

00:31:49.359 --> 00:31:50.640
You knew he was unreliable.

00:31:50.640 --> 00:31:51.839
Yet you still made him carry the grill.

00:31:51.839 --> 00:31:52.920
Now you're blaming me?

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.160
His stupidity has nothing to do with me.

00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:56.160
Your task assignment was unreasonable.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:57.720
Yesterday you were the one who wanted Qiu'er to carry it.

00:31:57.720 --> 00:31:58.480
You said it yourself.

00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.160
Alright, alright, alright.

00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:00.880
We shouldn't have let Qiu'er carry this grill.

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.119
Okay, fine, fine.

00:32:02.119 --> 00:32:02.920
It's fine, it's fine.

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:04.759
Big Brother, why do you always side with Qiu'er?

00:32:04.759 --> 00:32:05.200
I don't.

00:32:05.200 --> 00:32:06.839
Exactly, he made a mistake and you won't even let us criticize him.

00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:07.599
Enough, enough.

00:32:07.599 --> 00:32:08.640
I brought barbecue skewers.

00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:09.759
Let's head over first.

00:32:09.759 --> 00:32:11.440
I'll figure out a way to grill them for us later.

00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:12.160
Problem solved, right?

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:13.720
Let's go.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:14.720
It's fine.

00:32:14.720 --> 00:32:15.759
Why didn't you bring it?

00:32:15.759 --> 00:32:16.480
Don't ask me.

00:32:18.759 --> 00:32:20.160
Why didn't you bring it?

00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.240
Why ask me? Couldn't you bring it yourself?

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:23.160
It's fine.

00:32:23.519 --> 00:32:25.599
Back in the day, you were the clumsy one, the most unreliable.

00:32:25.599 --> 00:32:26.640
You have the nerve to talk.

00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.119
My clumsiness back then, wasn't it because you hit me?

00:32:28.119 --> 00:32:29.519
So what if I hit you?

00:32:29.839 --> 00:32:32.119
If I hadn't hit you, would you have grown up this big?

00:32:33.119 --> 00:32:33.680
Satisfied?

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:35.119
But I remember that meal back then...

00:32:35.119 --> 00:32:36.240
...we ate it with great relish.

00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.759
Yeah, it turned out fine in the end.

00:32:37.839 --> 00:32:39.079
Let's see who can throw the farthest.

00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:40.920
Alright.

00:32:41.200 --> 00:32:41.880
Here goes.

00:32:44.440 --> 00:32:45.519
Still trying to scare people.

00:32:45.519 --> 00:32:46.880
Still warming up.

00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:49.680
Let me try.

00:32:49.680 --> 00:32:50.480
Come on, one by one.

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:02.519
How about we build a stove with stones?

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:03.960
That's a great idea!

00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:05.240
I'll go find some stones.

00:33:05.920 --> 00:33:08.240
Then we'll light it with wood.

00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:09.920
Big Bro, is this big enough?

00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:10.680
No problem.

00:33:10.839 --> 00:33:11.680
Is that good?

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:12.799
It's lit! It's lit! It's lit!

00:33:12.799 --> 00:33:13.319
Perfect.

00:33:13.559 --> 00:33:14.480
Let's put some skewers on first.

00:33:17.519 --> 00:33:18.960
Grab something and fan it.

00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:20.519
Here, here, here.

00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:22.759
Here, take this.

00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.680
Watch your hands! Watch your hands, Weiguo!

00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:42.079
Dig in.

00:33:43.759 --> 00:33:44.400
Here.

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:47.519
Here.

00:33:49.720 --> 00:33:50.759
You know, this time...

00:33:50.759 --> 00:33:53.599
This team-building event Weiguo organized is really good.

00:33:53.960 --> 00:33:55.920
Qiu'er gathered the firewood.

00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:58.000
A few of us built the stone stove.

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:00.359
And Weiguo prepared everything so meticulously.

00:34:00.559 --> 00:34:02.599
That's why when the four of us brothers are together...

00:34:02.799 --> 00:34:04.440
No matter how big the difficulty...

00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:06.359
It's not a problem, you know?

00:34:07.319 --> 00:34:09.079
Big Bro, what are you doing? What's wrong?

00:34:09.599 --> 00:34:10.480
Big Bro, you...

00:34:12.039 --> 00:34:13.519
It's just the smoke getting to my eyes.

00:34:13.679 --> 00:34:14.639
You... this...

00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.000
Look, hurry, hurry! Quick, quick!

00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:17.320
Let's... let's not just eat.

00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:18.360
What do you want to drink?

00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.440
I brought drinks.

00:34:19.480 --> 00:34:20.000
Left them in the car, forgot to bring them.

00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:20.440
Alright.

00:34:20.559 --> 00:34:21.199
I'll go get them.

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:22.960
Um, I... I'll help you.

00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.239
Don't you go, I'll go.

00:34:42.679 --> 00:34:44.360
When were you planning to tell me?

00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:45.960
Were you going to take it to your grave?

00:34:48.599 --> 00:34:49.480
So you know too.

00:34:49.599 --> 00:34:51.239
I saw Xiao Wu last night.

00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:53.079
The former underling of Xue Damazi.

00:34:53.159 --> 00:34:54.199
He told me everything.

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:57.880
Oh, it's about that.

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.079
What did you think it was?

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:01.440
Nothing.

00:35:01.679 --> 00:35:02.679
All these years...

00:35:02.880 --> 00:35:04.760
Why couldn't you have told me sooner?

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:13.800
I'm sorry.

00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.119
Let's not talk about this.

00:35:18.199 --> 00:35:19.239
These past years...

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:22.719
I should be the one apologizing to you first.

00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:25.199
I... I never knew, really.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.679
We've been competing since we were kids.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.400
No...

00:35:28.920 --> 00:35:30.199
It wasn't really a fight.

00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.320
We just never wanted to lose to the other.

00:35:32.440 --> 00:35:34.840
Whether it was grades or playing games...

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:36.079
We always wanted to beat each other.

00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.159
Including...

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.400
That incident with the failed recommendation.

00:35:39.519 --> 00:35:40.920
I hated you for so many years because of it.

00:35:42.480 --> 00:35:44.719
Why... why wouldn't you tell me?

00:35:45.239 --> 00:35:46.239
It's my fault too.

00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.920
I never gave you a chance to explain.

00:35:49.760 --> 00:35:50.440
Lianbao.

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:53.880
We cleared the air that day we had dumplings.

00:35:54.679 --> 00:35:55.840
It's all in the past.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:56.960
We're doing fine now.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.400
No need to bring that up.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.679
Don't tell Big Brother or Qiu'er either.

00:36:01.519 --> 00:36:03.760
It's over, it's fine.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:05.280
Alright, enough talking.

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:06.440
Hurry back.

00:36:07.159 --> 00:36:07.880
Coming!

00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:08.480
Coming!

00:36:10.159 --> 00:36:10.800
Let's go.

00:36:34.559 --> 00:36:36.440
You dressed pretty stylishly as a kid.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.719
This is Weiguo.

00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.280
I searched forever to find this photo.

00:36:44.639 --> 00:36:48.039
He was only about three or four then.

00:36:57.719 --> 00:36:58.880
Once we open for business tomorrow...

00:36:59.599 --> 00:37:00.800
And get the restaurant running smoothly...

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:02.360
I'll have Second Brother keep an eye on things there.

00:37:02.559 --> 00:37:04.400
I'll take Weiguo out to see the sights.

00:37:05.159 --> 00:37:06.719
He hasn't been back in over twenty years.

00:37:07.079 --> 00:37:07.840
Alright.

00:37:08.880 --> 00:37:12.880
Later, once Weiguo's overseas lawsuit is settled...

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.599
Try to persuade him to come back, okay?

00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.199
No matter how good it is out there...

00:37:16.199 --> 00:37:17.719
Can it compare to home?

00:37:22.159 --> 00:37:23.880
Your hair...

00:37:24.239 --> 00:37:25.679
I need to give you another perm soon.

00:37:25.679 --> 00:37:28.159
Look here, here... the top, it's almost gone.

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:33.679
Go to sleep.

00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:34.960
Go to sleep.

00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:47.119
Hey...

00:37:48.079 --> 00:37:50.119
Shouldn't we find Weiguo...

00:37:50.119 --> 00:37:51.480
A wife?

00:37:52.239 --> 00:37:53.719
He's a grown man now.

00:37:53.840 --> 00:37:55.440
He can't stay single forever, right?

00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.239
Look...

00:37:56.519 --> 00:37:58.840
His wife is pregnant again, right?

00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:02.400
In the future, I'll watch their next generation grow up strong.

00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.360
And enjoy the happiness of family.

00:38:04.679 --> 00:38:06.440
Don't worry about other people's business.

00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:08.000
Maybe he already has kids overseas.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.119
Just didn't tell us.

00:38:09.760 --> 00:38:11.639
I mean, this kid...

00:38:55.079 --> 00:38:56.360
I went to see Auntie.

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:58.920
She said we should resolve our grievances.

00:39:00.079 --> 00:39:00.800
I was thinking...

00:39:01.159 --> 00:39:02.079
We could put on a little act.

00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.079
It's been so many years...

00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:06.159
I...

00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.320
We're finally all together again.

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.480
I... I thought in this lifetime...

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:16.440
I wouldn't get to see it.

00:39:16.519 --> 00:39:18.159
Auntie, look what you're saying.

00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:20.639
But you're seeing it now, we're all together.

00:39:21.519 --> 00:39:23.079
I want to bring Auntie back home.

00:39:23.079 --> 00:39:24.440
And stay with her properly for a while.

00:39:25.119 --> 00:39:26.639
You and Uncle Tong, Auntie Tong, move out.

00:39:26.639 --> 00:39:27.760
Vacate the house.

00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:33.400
I just want to ask you...

00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:36.920
Do you genuinely want to help Feifei?

00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:39.880
The issue isn't about...

00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:40.360
No, no, no.

00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:41.920
Don't give me that useless talk.

00:39:45.079 --> 00:39:46.159
This kid...

00:39:47.679 --> 00:39:49.280
Wants your help now.

00:39:49.719 --> 00:39:51.440
I just want to know if you're sincere.

00:39:51.440 --> 00:39:52.800
I sincerely want to help him.

00:39:53.199 --> 00:39:54.119
I think it's best like this.

00:39:54.199 --> 00:39:56.960
Don't look for outside money anymore.

00:39:57.519 --> 00:39:59.599
I'll invest in Penglexuan.

00:39:59.599 --> 00:40:01.280
Today, with a bit of drink in me...

00:40:01.639 --> 00:40:02.920
I want to say to Big Brother...

00:40:03.119 --> 00:40:05.039
Previously, when I removed you as Chairman...

00:40:05.039 --> 00:40:06.760
I was too willful, it was my mistake.

00:40:06.760 --> 00:40:07.480
Don't...

00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:09.760
I really feel Big Brother has grown.

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.119
Big Brother is very different now.
