WEBVTT

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:15.090
Just cooperate.

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.300
Don't get cute.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:21.740
Can you hear me?

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.210
See clearly?

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:34.370
Yes.

00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:40.540
Mr. Guan,

00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:41.690
play it by ear.

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:43.580
If it goes south,

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.730
go to Plan B.

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:46.540
Don't worry, Movie Star.

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.260
We'll get everything in place.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:50.580
You just put on a good show.

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.690
Get the job done.

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:56.860
Mr. Han worked cases

00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:57.980
like this before?

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:06.740
Biao would

00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:07.850
have my bag if he were here.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:23.020
Wu Ya?

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.290
A She?

00:01:26.430 --> 00:01:27.850
General's reputation

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:28.740
precedes him.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.930
A pleasure.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.050
Just the two of you?

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:36.260
Just the two of us.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:37.980
For such a big deal,

00:01:38.230 --> 00:01:39.660
too many people shows no sincerity.

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:41.260
And it'd

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.570
make you easier to expose.

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.380
Not safe.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:47.770
An introduction.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:48.660
He's...

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.330
Biao.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.130
My best friend.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:53.980
We will meet often.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:06.540
Biao?

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:41.020
[Episode 19]

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.130
So itchy!

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.220
Do it properly.

00:04:09.430 --> 00:04:10.220
Alright now?

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.380
Well,

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.260
this way.

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:27.660
The guests are here.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:36.540
Let me introduce.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.730
This is Mr. Meng.

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:39.930
These two

00:04:40.160 --> 00:04:41.850
are the trusted aides

00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:42.810
of General Nuo Sha.

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:45.220
Wu Ya. Biao.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.050
Did you bring the deposit?

00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:05.850
Sit.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:13.370
Xiaoxi,

00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:14.700
upload the images.

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:15.980
Run facial recognition.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.370
Check the background

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.540
on Mr. Meng and A She.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:19.460
Yes.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:57.660
Biao, right?

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:00.410
This is for you.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.850
I added a little something special.

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.780
Try it.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:10.810
We have a rule.

00:06:11.510 --> 00:06:12.610
We sell, we don't use.

00:06:13.070 --> 00:06:14.490
I appreciate the offer.

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:22.540
Why so nervous?

00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.730
For such a big deal,

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.340
peace is what matters, right?

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.410
I'm drinking this

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:28.850
for him.

00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:46.810
Biao...

00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.220
Biao...

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:50.020
It's good.

00:07:00.870 --> 00:07:02.460
General sent us here

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:05.850
with a lot of sincerity.

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:07.410
I've never

00:07:07.430 --> 00:07:09.250
heard him

00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:11.930
speak well of anyone.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:13.250
We're here

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.700
for a long-term partnership.

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:17.700
How much do you want?

00:07:19.430 --> 00:07:20.490
How much do you have?

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:27.340
Mr. Guan, got it.

00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:28.810
A She's name is She Nana.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:30.140
From Puye, Hujian.

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:31.100
She got five years

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.370
for running a prostitution ring.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:33.610
Currently unemployed.

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:34.610
Mr. Meng's name

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.490
is Qiu Kai.

00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:36.730
From Luxi, Jiang City.

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.170
He got five years for assault

00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:39.050
and running

00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.660
an online loan shark operation.

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:42.140
Released three years ago.

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:43.580
Also currently unemployed.

00:07:44.310 --> 00:07:46.780
So both have records.

00:07:58.270 --> 00:07:59.780
I'll add another million.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.170
Six million yuan in total.

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:05.290
I want three months of your supply.

00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:18.540
Good!

00:08:35.030 --> 00:08:36.220
Don't tell me you're just

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:39.010
counting cash without showing the goods?

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:40.940
That's not

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:42.340
how things are done.

00:08:44.550 --> 00:08:45.420
No rush.

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.180
Chat a bit more.

00:08:47.870 --> 00:08:49.370
Counting takes time.

00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.060
Plenty of time to look later.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:53.730
Rules are rules.

00:08:56.750 --> 00:08:57.730
In business,

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:59.770
it's my way

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.370
or no way.

00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:17.460
Truly General's man.

00:09:17.750 --> 00:09:18.650
Got some style.

00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:19.730
Come on.

00:09:20.080 --> 00:09:20.700
Have your seat.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:22.490
Sit.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.340
All units, attention.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:32.420
On my command.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:33.490
Prepare to move.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.490
Did you

00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:06.300
find a good chemist for this?

00:10:07.790 --> 00:10:08.820
Quality is what counts.

00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:10.700
Does it matter who the chemist is?

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:12.220
Absolutely.

00:10:13.030 --> 00:10:14.530
I need to know

00:10:14.550 --> 00:10:15.650
if this chemist is in this

00:10:15.670 --> 00:10:16.610
for the long haul.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:17.890
If I blow

00:10:17.910 --> 00:10:18.980
this deal,

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.610
I'll be eating a bullet

00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.250
from General.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.980
That six million is just the appetizer.

00:10:29.270 --> 00:10:30.610
The volume we'll need

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.060
is massive.

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:34.420
If you wanna make a fortune,

00:10:34.790 --> 00:10:36.530
let me meet the chemist.

00:10:43.750 --> 00:10:44.250
Think.

00:10:49.750 --> 00:10:50.300
Fine.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:03.700
Hi,

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:05.580
a buyer wanna know

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.980
the new drug's development.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:08.980
(I got my hands)

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.850
(on the formula of Raw Diamond)

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:12.130
(and studied it.)

00:11:12.390 --> 00:11:13.730
(Then I used some substitutes)

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:14.820
(to develop the new drug.)

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.100
No.

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:19.370
He's not the chemist.

00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:22.770
Han Feng,

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.130
(the new drug was developed)

00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:26.980
(through targeted experiments.)

00:11:27.550 --> 00:11:28.340
That's why

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:29.530
there are some variations.

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:31.730
It's not copying Raw Diamond,

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.220
but developing a new drug.

00:11:33.550 --> 00:11:35.220
(It's not just about)

00:11:35.750 --> 00:11:37.180
(swapping ingredients)

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:37.940
(and creating it.)

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.300
Why would an experimental drug

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:43.220
end up on the street?

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.250
Experimental drugs shouldn't

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:49.530
leak to the market.

00:11:50.630 --> 00:11:51.370
It would

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:52.610
ruin Mr. Q's name.

00:11:54.910 --> 00:11:55.530
Right.

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:01.060
Attention.

00:12:01.360 --> 00:12:01.980
Abort mission.

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:02.850
Abort mission.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.650
Why?

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:06.980
They won't let us see the chemist.

00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:09.610
Han Feng

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:12.220
might be playing a long game.

00:12:35.150 --> 00:12:36.490
Besides you two, did General

00:12:36.870 --> 00:12:38.100
send anyone else?

00:12:38.910 --> 00:12:39.530
Mr. Han,

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:41.250
you're a good driver.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:42.250
Cut the crap.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.420
We have a saying here.

00:12:44.440 --> 00:12:45.730
Survival comes first.

00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.340
I suggest you choose to live.

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:50.890
Four or five more.

00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:52.100
How to reach them?

00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:03.060
Police check.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:04.980
ID, please.

00:13:05.550 --> 00:13:06.420
Pop the trunk.

00:13:18.910 --> 00:13:19.370
Go.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:39.370
Get out.

00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:45.370
Su!

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:47.530
Get him!

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:48.580
Come on!

00:13:49.910 --> 00:13:50.490
Stop!

00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:51.460
Go!

00:13:59.550 --> 00:13:59.980
Go!

00:14:06.790 --> 00:14:07.370
Ms. Zhu!

00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:11.650
Stop!

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:12.890
Don't run!

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:31.730
Go!

00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:32.650
Don't run!

00:14:33.870 --> 00:14:34.300
Halt!

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.370
Moving in.

00:15:09.790 --> 00:15:10.490
Watch out!

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:22.770
Mr. Han,

00:16:23.390 --> 00:16:24.650
I failed to protect her.

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:28.980
I failed to protect Ms. Zhu.

00:16:31.390 --> 00:16:32.060
Sorry.

00:16:47.150 --> 00:16:47.730
Su.

00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.010
It's not on you.

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:53.940
Ms. Zhu will be fine.

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.250
Don't worry.

00:17:11.350 --> 00:17:11.940
How's she?

00:17:13.070 --> 00:17:14.180
The shrapnel from the bomb

00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.010
has been removed

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.220
from the patient's body.

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:18.380
During the laparotomy,

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:20.050
we found the spleen

00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:21.620
was the only injury.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:22.570
Is she out of danger?

00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:24.770
She's stable now.

00:17:25.350 --> 00:17:25.860
But due to

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:27.090
concussion and blood loss,

00:17:27.310 --> 00:17:28.810
she remains in a coma.

00:17:29.270 --> 00:17:30.530
As for when she'll wake up,

00:17:30.920 --> 00:17:31.770
that's uncertain.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:44.090
It's fine.

00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:46.940
Ms. Zhu will be okay.

00:17:50.590 --> 00:17:51.330
She'll be fine.

00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:32.530
Let's talk about

00:18:32.550 --> 00:18:33.490
the people you killed.

00:18:35.550 --> 00:18:36.860
After you killed Li Yiqi,

00:18:38.880 --> 00:18:40.570
why did you go to
Fenglin Ducheng Community?

00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:44.810
That night,

00:18:45.310 --> 00:18:47.140
Wang Chen was at the scene
where Zhai Xixi

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:47.980
was found.

00:18:49.720 --> 00:18:51.730
You went to give him the new drug, right?

00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.140
After killing Song Weimin,

00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:57.050
Wang Chen called you.

00:18:58.830 --> 00:19:00.010
And when you met,

00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:02.460
you killed him.

00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:04.900
What took you so long?

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:06.330
I'm in trouble.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.050
I'm a suspect now.

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:09.460
What do I do now?

00:19:09.830 --> 00:19:11.140
Please... help me.

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:12.730
Where's the body?

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:13.730
Over here.

00:19:53.550 --> 00:19:54.700
Then, Cui Hao.

00:19:56.920 --> 00:19:58.420
The ether and cedilanid

00:19:58.750 --> 00:20:00.460
you used to kill Li Yiqi

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.460
were gotten from him, right?

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:04.530
Oh,

00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:05.570
the vegetable

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:06.900
you asked me to watch

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:08.290
is showing signs.

00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:20.530
And Wan Guoxin.

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:24.940
When he was investigating the hospital,

00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:25.940
he found Cui Hao.

00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.250
So you killed Wan

00:20:53.350 --> 00:20:54.810
and Cui Hao.

00:21:09.720 --> 00:21:10.900
Finally, Chen Chuchuan.

00:21:32.590 --> 00:21:33.940
Why did you kill them?

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:37.810
Do you really think

00:21:37.830 --> 00:21:38.810
your silence can stop us?

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.570
Wang Bo, listen.

00:21:42.110 --> 00:21:42.900
You're not

00:21:42.920 --> 00:21:43.730
walking out of here.

00:21:44.590 --> 00:21:45.490
About Raw Diamond,

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:46.700
what do you know?

00:21:47.310 --> 00:21:48.330
You better

00:21:48.350 --> 00:21:49.050
come clean.

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:07.730
Mr. Gao, Ms. Zhang.

00:23:08.400 --> 00:23:08.900
Any leads?

00:23:10.750 --> 00:23:11.460
She was killed

00:23:11.590 --> 00:23:12.700
by a stab to the heart.

00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:13.900
It's also

00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:14.940
the only fatal wound.

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:17.420
Adhesive residue on the lips.

00:23:17.790 --> 00:23:18.250
Her mouth

00:23:18.270 --> 00:23:19.570
was taped shut.

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:21.140
Before death,

00:23:21.400 --> 00:23:22.730
she might have been beaten.

00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:26.180
And the time of death?

00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:28.140
Over 12 hours.

00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:28.980
Muscle groups

00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:30.180
show signs of rigor mortis.

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:31.700
Maybe after midnight yesterday.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.570
So she was killed

00:23:34.310 --> 00:23:35.620
right after the deal.

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:37.330
Got it.

00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:42.420
Mr. Guan,

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:44.010
we found She Nana's body.

00:23:48.350 --> 00:23:49.530
Fatal wound to the heart.

00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:50.900
Okay.

00:23:52.350 --> 00:23:53.220
A tattoo

00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:54.090
on the right neck.

00:24:02.110 --> 00:24:03.730
Using distillation and crystallization,

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:05.420
I recovered the drug from the wine

00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:06.660
Mr. Han brought from the deal.

00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:07.980
I compared it with the drugs

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.250
from previous cases.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:10.380
These are

00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:11.380
crystals of the new drug

00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:12.490
before division.

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:13.900
So A She

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:14.980
is connected

00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:15.770
to this new drug.

00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:17.530
During the autopsy,

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:18.900
we found

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:21.250
the victim had

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:22.290
severe lung damage

00:24:22.310 --> 00:24:23.660
from hydrofluoric acid.

00:24:23.830 --> 00:24:25.220
Severe bone demineralization

00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:26.380
was also present.

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:27.330
This pathology

00:24:27.350 --> 00:24:28.530
comes from

00:24:28.550 --> 00:24:29.420
long-term exposure

00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.180
to toxic chemicals.

00:24:30.680 --> 00:24:31.420
Hydrofluoric acid.

00:24:32.160 --> 00:24:33.050
Chronic fluorine poisoning.

00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:35.530
What's hydrofluoric acid used for?

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:36.860
It's primarily used

00:24:37.350 --> 00:24:38.980
for processing and manufacturing

00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:40.180
in glass factories.

00:24:40.790 --> 00:24:41.380
Glass factories?

00:24:43.030 --> 00:24:43.810
So she worked

00:24:43.830 --> 00:24:44.770
in a glass factory?

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:48.250
Mr. Han and I

00:24:48.270 --> 00:24:49.010
once took down

00:24:49.030 --> 00:24:50.180
a trafficking operation.

00:24:50.720 --> 00:24:51.290
They dissolved

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:52.730
the drugs in alcohol.

00:24:53.110 --> 00:24:54.570
The buyers extracted them

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:55.380
via distillation

00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:56.810
and crystallization.

00:24:57.510 --> 00:24:58.420
So the new drug lab

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.330
could be disguised

00:25:00.790 --> 00:25:02.490
as a glass factory.

00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:04.330
In the Raw Diamond case,

00:25:04.830 --> 00:25:05.730
we assumed

00:25:05.750 --> 00:25:06.770
the drug

00:25:07.200 --> 00:25:08.010
was from overseas,

00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:09.570
but it led to Li Ming.

00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:11.980
Then it could also

00:25:12.030 --> 00:25:13.700
be domestic this time.

00:25:14.270 --> 00:25:15.250
Maybe in He City.

00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:19.810
Hydrofluoric acid

00:25:20.200 --> 00:25:21.730
is highly regulated.

00:25:22.200 --> 00:25:24.700
Its purchase, transport, and storage

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:26.810
require strict authorization.

00:25:27.270 --> 00:25:28.250
We can leverage this

00:25:28.510 --> 00:25:29.380
to penetrate the case.

00:25:30.350 --> 00:25:30.940
Su, Yuanyang.

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:32.570
Search two areas.

00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:33.620
Distilleries near He City,

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:35.010
and places that bought

00:25:35.030 --> 00:25:35.940
hydrofluoric acid.

00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:36.940
Yes.

00:25:37.590 --> 00:25:38.010
Han Feng,

00:25:38.830 --> 00:25:39.770
this is

00:25:39.790 --> 00:25:40.620
A She's tattoo.

00:25:41.350 --> 00:25:42.570
This one is Wang Bo's.

00:26:26.640 --> 00:26:27.140
Qiu Kai?

00:26:29.200 --> 00:26:31.570
Served time for assault.

00:26:32.510 --> 00:26:33.980
Now you're

00:26:34.510 --> 00:26:35.330
selling drugs.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:36.660
You can't

00:26:36.790 --> 00:26:37.900
stay legal?

00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:38.900
Come clean.

00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:40.140
Who's your supplier?

00:26:40.790 --> 00:26:41.490
Who's the chemist?

00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:42.940
Sir... sir,

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.730
I... I was just a front.

00:26:47.350 --> 00:26:48.250
Don't know anything?

00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:49.730
Wait...

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:50.330
Enough.

00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:51.940
Let's cut the act.

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:52.810
Start talking.

00:26:54.830 --> 00:26:56.140
Actually... it was just...

00:26:56.750 --> 00:26:58.180
A She asked me

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:00.180
to play a part.

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:03.010
If they want to meet the chemist,

00:27:03.270 --> 00:27:04.380
use this phone to call.

00:27:08.790 --> 00:27:10.010
Why you?

00:27:11.200 --> 00:27:12.090
Handsome face?

00:27:13.030 --> 00:27:14.180
I... I don't know.

00:27:14.790 --> 00:27:15.620
I just...

00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:17.250
She paid, I did the job.

00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.180
How much?

00:27:21.310 --> 00:27:21.940
How much?

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:25.730
A She said... said...

00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:27.290
she'd give me

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:30.940
100,000 yuan each time.

00:27:34.310 --> 00:27:35.140
100,000?

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.090
That much?

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:38.250
Just for a little acting?

00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:39.860
Serious?

00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:41.050
Sir, I... I'm not lying.

00:27:41.070 --> 00:27:42.050
I'm telling the truth.

00:27:42.270 --> 00:27:42.570
Really!

00:27:42.590 --> 00:27:43.530
That's all I know!

00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:45.220
I'm not lying!

00:27:45.550 --> 00:27:46.770
I... I don't know anything else!

00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:48.050
He really knows nothing.

00:27:48.070 --> 00:27:48.570
Fine then.

00:27:48.790 --> 00:27:50.570
Trafficking charge.

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.490
Caught in the act.

00:27:51.750 --> 00:27:52.330
Report it.

00:27:53.830 --> 00:27:54.330
Wait!

00:27:54.480 --> 00:27:54.980
No!

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.620
Please!

00:27:55.830 --> 00:27:56.220
Hold on!

00:27:56.510 --> 00:27:57.460
I remember now!

00:27:58.960 --> 00:27:59.250
Say it.

00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:01.050
A She told me...

00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:03.250
there's...

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:05.220
a boss above her.

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:07.250
Her word isn't final.

00:28:07.550 --> 00:28:08.420
But I don't know...

00:28:08.590 --> 00:28:08.980
I don't know

00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:09.980
if that's true.

00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:11.220
Sir,

00:28:11.270 --> 00:28:12.660
I've told you

00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:13.620
everything I know.

00:28:14.790 --> 00:28:15.770
You should...

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:16.290
well...

00:28:16.350 --> 00:28:17.330
I'm cooperating so fully.

00:28:17.350 --> 00:28:19.380
You should go easy on me.

00:28:19.830 --> 00:28:20.380
Right?

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:21.700
I was just acting.

00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.010
I'm a fake.

00:28:23.590 --> 00:28:25.050
You already figured it out.

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.490
What more do you want?

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.220
You know A She, right?

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:38.660
Yeah.

00:28:41.030 --> 00:28:42.180
Cobras.
[*"She" means "snake".]

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:44.220
And rattlesnakes.

00:28:47.110 --> 00:28:48.770
I don't care what snakes you know!

00:28:49.350 --> 00:28:50.330
A She died.

00:28:55.350 --> 00:28:56.090
You're lying.

00:28:56.550 --> 00:28:57.940
Stop bluffing.

00:28:58.790 --> 00:28:59.570
See for yourself.

00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:02.730
Still think we're lying?

00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:12.140
How could she be dead?

00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:15.420
How did she die?

00:29:16.110 --> 00:29:17.010
You tell me.

00:29:18.270 --> 00:29:19.140
Let me out!

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:20.570
I need to avenge A She!

00:29:20.590 --> 00:29:21.330
Let me out!

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.010
Do what you want when I get back!

00:29:23.110 --> 00:29:23.770
Wang Bo!

00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:24.940
You think

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:26.050
we're letting you go?

00:29:26.790 --> 00:29:27.530
What you need to do

00:29:27.550 --> 00:29:28.330
is tell us

00:29:28.350 --> 00:29:28.940
what you know.

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.770
That's the only way

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:31.940
we'll find the killer soon.

00:29:32.480 --> 00:29:33.530
If you really care about

00:29:33.550 --> 00:29:34.290
A She.

00:29:35.350 --> 00:29:36.570
We'll catch the killer

00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:37.570
sooner or later.

00:29:38.160 --> 00:29:39.330
But if you don't cooperate,

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:40.940
the killer

00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:41.810
could use this time

00:29:42.310 --> 00:29:43.090
to get away.

00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:44.570
Then...

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:45.140
I'll say.

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:52.330
Feng Zhengxi.

00:29:53.310 --> 00:29:54.220
Must be him.

00:29:56.110 --> 00:29:57.010
Who's Feng Zhengxi?

00:29:58.750 --> 00:29:59.330
Are you sure

00:29:59.350 --> 00:30:00.290
he killed A She?

00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:04.730
After I finished Chen Chuchuan,

00:30:06.920 --> 00:30:07.860
I found a memory card

00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:10.180
on him.

00:30:13.200 --> 00:30:15.570
That was the reason Feng Zhengxi wanted

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:17.180
to kill him.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.180
What's on it?

00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.570
It's

00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:23.180
the contact information

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.050
for General Nuo Sha.

00:30:24.790 --> 00:30:25.490
He promised

00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:26.660
a million yuan

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.330
for it.

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:30.180
A million?

00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:32.660
That old bastard Feng Zhengxi!

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.380
All that dirty work,

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:35.900
and only a million?

00:30:36.510 --> 00:30:37.570
A million

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.050
will last us a while.

00:30:39.790 --> 00:30:40.660
When it runs out,

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:42.180
I'll get you more.

00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:46.420
Bo.

00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:48.380
I have an idea.

00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:49.420
I can

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.770
pose as the chemist

00:30:53.510 --> 00:30:54.770
and make a deal with Nuo Sha.

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.490
We take the money

00:30:56.510 --> 00:30:57.490
and disappear.

00:30:58.070 --> 00:30:58.660
Let's start

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.250
a quiet life somewhere, okay?

00:31:00.920 --> 00:31:01.810
Feng Zhengxi must have

00:31:01.830 --> 00:31:02.940
found this

00:31:03.830 --> 00:31:04.730
and killed her.

00:31:07.920 --> 00:31:08.900
It's my fault.

00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:16.250
Tell us about Feng Zhengxi and Nuo Sha.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.810
Feng Zhengxi owns a glass factory.

00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.380
It's actually a drug lab.

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:25.490
Chen Chuchuan

00:31:25.510 --> 00:31:26.330
got drugs from there.

00:31:31.590 --> 00:31:32.490
Feng Zhengxi

00:31:32.510 --> 00:31:34.010
produces drugs at Jingfeng Glass Factory.

00:31:34.160 --> 00:31:35.570
He wanna expand his market,

00:31:35.590 --> 00:31:36.730
so he's contacting Nuo Sha.

00:31:37.270 --> 00:31:38.420
It's a perfect match

00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:39.940
with the drug we extracted

00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:41.250
from the wine.

00:31:58.110 --> 00:31:58.570
Look.

00:31:59.510 --> 00:32:00.250
Same as the bottle

00:32:00.270 --> 00:32:01.050
Mr. Han brought.

00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:03.620
This is it.

00:32:04.510 --> 00:32:05.380
Mr. Han. Mr. Guan.

00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:06.460
They have

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:07.620
found the glass factory.

00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:09.660
Outskirts of He City.

00:32:24.750 --> 00:32:26.010
Using Wang Bo's lead,

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:26.770
we've located

00:32:26.790 --> 00:32:28.050
Jingfeng Glass Factory

00:32:28.510 --> 00:32:29.330
and scouted it.

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:31.900
It's confirmed

00:32:32.200 --> 00:32:33.010
that this factory

00:32:33.270 --> 00:32:33.980
is the drug lab

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:34.810
we've been after.

00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:40.140
Feng Zhengxi,

00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:40.940
formerly Feng Jun.

00:32:41.030 --> 00:32:41.860
Born in 1975.

00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:42.620
From He City.

00:32:42.750 --> 00:32:43.810
Donghai University graduate.

00:32:43.830 --> 00:32:44.810
Chemical Engineering.

00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:45.530
Returned home

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:46.420
eight years ago

00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:47.220
to start up.

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:47.900
He did

00:32:47.920 --> 00:32:48.730
a year and a half

00:32:48.750 --> 00:32:49.940
for running a gambling ring.

00:32:50.350 --> 00:32:51.180
Three years ago,

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:51.940
he purchased

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:52.940
Jingfeng Glass Factory.

00:32:53.110 --> 00:32:54.700
So he's been using the factory

00:32:54.750 --> 00:32:56.220
for drug production

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:56.900
for three years.

00:33:06.110 --> 00:33:06.730
Target confirmed.

00:33:07.110 --> 00:33:07.530
Move.

00:33:07.750 --> 00:33:08.140
Yes.

00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:04.700
I'll take them on!

00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:10.980
Run!

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:15.690
Cops! Run!

00:34:18.320 --> 00:34:19.300
Stop them! Hurry!

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:21.820
Go!

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:41.780
Breach.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:08.740
Hurry!

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:09.780
Down! Don't move!

00:36:11.230 --> 00:36:11.780
Down! Stay down!

00:36:11.840 --> 00:36:12.420
Down!

00:36:14.280 --> 00:36:15.340
- Freeze! - Don't move!

00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:16.260
Down!

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:17.570
Hands up!

00:36:17.590 --> 00:36:18.380
Stay down!

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:19.570
Hands up!

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:19.980
Down!

00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:20.900
Get down!

00:36:23.800 --> 00:36:24.260
Look up.

00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:32.010
Go.

00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:02.940
Stay still.

00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:04.420
Mr. Han,

00:37:05.230 --> 00:37:06.300
no sign of Feng Zhengxi.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:07.610
He might have run.

00:37:08.590 --> 00:37:09.010
Guan.

00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:10.780
Let's split up.

00:37:11.320 --> 00:37:11.610
Fine.

00:37:12.110 --> 00:37:12.420
Go!

00:37:28.190 --> 00:37:28.610
(Han Feng,)

00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:30.380
(when you worked the Raw Diamond case,)

00:37:30.670 --> 00:37:31.210
(did you find)

00:37:31.230 --> 00:37:32.530
(a link to Feng Zhengxi?)

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:34.940
No.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:36.900
But I found something new.

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:41.380
Wei,

00:38:41.400 --> 00:38:42.050
got a find.

00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:57.570
Split up.

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:19.090
Mr. Han,

00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:20.860
this must be

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:21.610
their lab.

00:39:22.190 --> 00:39:22.900
Bag it all.

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:23.900
Yes.

00:39:24.590 --> 00:39:25.210
Need backup.

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:51.300
The depression rate
stands at five percent.

00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:52.380
My research shows

00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:53.610
norepinephrine

00:39:53.670 --> 00:39:55.380
is effective against depression.

00:39:55.400 --> 00:39:56.780
Wu Yongchang left me this note

00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:57.820
in college.

00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:58.610
Wu Yongchang?

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:00.050
Your teacher

00:40:00.150 --> 00:40:01.570
might be connected to this case.

00:40:02.150 --> 00:40:03.690
The kidnapper could be Feng Zhengxi.

00:40:03.840 --> 00:40:05.260
The substance from the factory

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:06.940
is the new drug we've been tracking.

00:40:07.110 --> 00:40:09.420
They need this molecular formula

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.300
to produce the final drug.

00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:12.260
How would I know?

00:40:12.320 --> 00:40:13.090
Maybe Nuo Sha

00:40:13.110 --> 00:40:14.170
connected with the drug ring.

00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:14.780
Sizhe,

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:16.780
he's the man you're hunting.

00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:18.690
Give me Mr. K's diary.

00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:19.490
Otherwise,

00:40:19.510 --> 00:40:21.170
I'll kill your teacher.
