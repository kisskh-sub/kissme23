00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.199
You are Ye Biying, right?

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.080
You are Ye Biying, right?

00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.120
What are you doing?

00:01:51.839 --> 00:01:52.559
Let go of me!

00:01:55.039 --> 00:01:55.839
Let go of me!

00:02:00.239 --> 00:02:02.920
Shut up! Behave!

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:09.679
Stop that!

00:02:10.759 --> 00:02:11.759
What are you doing?

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.520
Let her go!

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.280
Father!

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.680
Ying'er!

00:02:39.719 --> 00:02:40.519
Father!

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.439
Why have you come back?

00:02:53.519 --> 00:02:55.799
Why come back in the middle of this chaos?

00:03:01.879 --> 00:03:02.680
She is my daughter.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.799
Why are you arresting her?

00:03:05.879 --> 00:03:07.760
We have some questions for her.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:08.959
She is my daughter.

00:03:08.959 --> 00:03:10.799
What's wrong with coming back to her own home?

00:03:12.719 --> 00:03:14.879
Do you know who you're talking to?

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.040
What?

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:19.719
Wait.

00:03:19.719 --> 00:03:20.400
I'm sorry.

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.000
Listen to me.

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:21.599
I've always warned you.

00:03:21.599 --> 00:03:22.719
Don't act so impulsively.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.599
Don't be so impulsive.

00:03:24.599 --> 00:03:25.280
Get out!

00:03:32.599 --> 00:03:33.319
Mr. Ye.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.040
Calm down.

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:36.000
I'm truly sorry.

00:03:36.959 --> 00:03:37.760
She is my daughter.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:38.479
Why are you arresting her?

00:03:38.479 --> 00:03:39.400
Yes, yes, yes.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:40.319
She is your daughter.

00:03:40.319 --> 00:03:40.759
Right?

00:03:40.879 --> 00:03:42.439
We just found out ourselves.

00:03:42.919 --> 00:03:44.000
Untie her quickly.

00:03:44.479 --> 00:03:45.479
Quickly!

00:03:45.479 --> 00:03:46.400
Untie her.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:51.960
Alright.

00:03:52.159 --> 00:03:53.039
It's okay.

00:03:53.039 --> 00:03:53.520
It's okay.

00:03:53.639 --> 00:03:54.560
Father will protect you.

00:03:55.599 --> 00:03:55.960
Come.

00:03:56.199 --> 00:03:56.639
Let's go.

00:03:58.719 --> 00:03:59.360
Please wait.

00:04:00.199 --> 00:04:01.280
Mr. Ye.

00:04:01.759 --> 00:04:04.960
We still have one more matter to investigate.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.879
Investigate what?

00:04:07.639 --> 00:04:08.360
It's this.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:09.879
This suitcase.

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.520
We discovered it.

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:14.080
We believe it's hers.

00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:15.759
And then?

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.439
Inside this...

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:19.319
There is a pistol.

00:04:25.639 --> 00:04:26.759
Is the gun yours?

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.719
It's not hers.

00:04:33.319 --> 00:04:34.639
I know my daughter.

00:04:35.159 --> 00:04:36.199
We can leave now, right?

00:04:38.159 --> 00:04:38.599
Fine.

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:43.240
Miss Ye.

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:44.520
Your foot.

00:04:45.639 --> 00:04:47.639
The area around here is all mountain roads.

00:04:47.639 --> 00:04:48.680
It's too dangerous like this.

00:04:49.199 --> 00:04:49.639
Have a seat.

00:04:49.639 --> 00:04:50.400
Sit, sit, sit.

00:04:50.439 --> 00:04:51.000
Sit, sit, sit.

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:51.479
Have a seat.

00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:52.080
Sit.

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:52.599
Sit.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:55.800
You see.

00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:57.879
You can't go out like this.

00:04:57.879 --> 00:04:59.360
You could easily get hurt.

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.520
May I borrow your esteemed foot?

00:05:25.879 --> 00:05:27.439
It fits perfectly.

00:05:31.439 --> 00:05:34.439
Where did this pistol come from?

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.280
Your occupation.

00:05:45.479 --> 00:05:48.439
I was a dance hostess at a ballroom in Shanghai.

00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:49.399
Is that so?

00:05:52.279 --> 00:05:55.560
That's a good profession these days.

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:59.199
You worked at the...

00:05:59.199 --> 00:06:01.680
Cathay Ballroom on Edward Road as a dance hostess.

00:06:03.240 --> 00:06:04.600
I've been to that ballroom.

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:05.839
The lighting is nice.

00:06:06.439 --> 00:06:11.000
It's just that the marble dance floor is a bit too slippery.

00:06:12.319 --> 00:06:13.120
Right?

00:06:21.959 --> 00:06:23.439
Medhurst Road.

00:06:24.800 --> 00:06:25.360
I didn't hear clearly.

00:06:25.360 --> 00:06:26.000
What?

00:06:26.199 --> 00:06:26.680
You say it.

00:06:29.759 --> 00:06:33.639
The Cathay Ballroom is on Medhurst Road.

00:06:34.959 --> 00:06:37.079
Not where you said.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:38.959
Furthermore...

00:06:40.759 --> 00:06:42.439
It has a sprung dance floor.

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:45.040
Not marble.

00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:48.879
Yes.

00:06:50.279 --> 00:06:52.360
I left Shanghai three or four years ago.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.160
No wonder I mixed things up.

00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:55.800
Back then...

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.399
We would all start from the barracks in Hongkou.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.680
First take the number 26 tram.

00:07:00.680 --> 00:07:01.959
First to Beihai Road.

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:05.600
Then pass by Park Lane to get to your ballroom.

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:07.279
At the entrance of Park Lane...

00:07:07.279 --> 00:07:09.680
There was also a Xieji Snack Shop.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:12.839
Their food was really delicious.

00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:14.959
Now tell me.

00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:17.279
What is your mission?

00:07:17.279 --> 00:07:18.480
Who sent you in?

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:19.720
Let her go! Let her go!

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.079
Whether my daughter is a dance hostess...

00:07:22.399 --> 00:07:23.399
Is none of your business.

00:07:23.439 --> 00:07:24.360
I'll handle it myself.

00:07:25.639 --> 00:07:26.199
Let's go.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.480
Mr. Ye.

00:07:29.639 --> 00:07:30.639
Do you think...

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:35.199
Your relationship with Commander Fujita...

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:37.639
Can protect her?

00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.600
I protect my daughter.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:44.959
I don't rely on anyone.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.720
Xia'er!

00:07:56.439 --> 00:07:57.319
Xia'er!

00:07:58.279 --> 00:07:58.720
Nanny!

00:07:58.759 --> 00:07:59.279
It's terrible!

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:00.279
It's terrible!

00:08:00.519 --> 00:08:01.879
The master has been taken to the police station.

00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:03.360
The Japanese have arrested him.

00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:03.920
Let's go.

00:08:04.199 --> 00:08:04.680
Go and see.

00:08:13.079 --> 00:08:13.720
What are you doing?

00:08:15.319 --> 00:08:16.199
Listen up, everyone!

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:17.759
Search the place!

00:08:18.079 --> 00:08:18.600
Yes, sir!

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.160
What are you doing?

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:34.399
Ye Longxia!

00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:44.160
Captain!

00:08:44.759 --> 00:08:47.120
What do you want? I'm busy!

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.920
An officer has barged in.

00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:01.480
Mr. Ye.

00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:02.920
My name is Takeki Ichiro.

00:09:03.199 --> 00:09:03.839
Pleased to meet you.

00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:04.879
I look forward to working with you.

00:09:09.319 --> 00:09:10.720
It's only been a few hours since I left you.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:12.879
And you've gotten yourself into such a mess.

00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.800
Your shirt buttons are all undone.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.399
Who undid them?

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:32.839
Button up your shirt.

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:39.920
You did it.

00:09:41.439 --> 00:09:41.959
Did she not tell you

00:09:41.959 --> 00:09:42.680
that she is my woman?

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:44.199
Speak.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.120
Wait a moment.

00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:46.800
We found this in that woman's bag.

00:09:46.800 --> 00:09:47.879
You shut your mouth.

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:53.439
May I ask who you are?

00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:55.920
This is the special envoy sent from Tokyo.

00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.920
Colonel Takeki Ichiro of the Imperial Aide-de-Camp Office.

00:10:02.200 --> 00:10:03.080
Salute!

00:10:04.559 --> 00:10:05.320
Order arms!

00:10:09.759 --> 00:10:10.639
Captain Inoue, is it?

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:11.039
Yes.

00:10:11.559 --> 00:10:12.039
I've long heard of you.

00:10:13.559 --> 00:10:14.759
When I was in Shanghai,

00:10:14.759 --> 00:10:17.039
your father, Mr. Inoue Akira, and I

00:10:17.039 --> 00:10:17.960
along with Miss Ye

00:10:17.960 --> 00:10:19.720
drank together at the Cathay Dance Hall.

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:24.200
Miss Ye is my assistant.

00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.440
She is under my protection.

00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:28.120
The gun in your hand was given to her by me.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:36.919
Keep the gun safe.

00:10:37.639 --> 00:10:38.759
If you encounter danger,

00:10:39.279 --> 00:10:40.480
you may fire directly.

00:10:42.879 --> 00:10:43.720
Colonel.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.039
The Commander is still waiting for us.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:49.840
May Miss Ye go home now?

00:10:50.159 --> 00:10:51.519
Of course. This way, please.

00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:52.840
Mr. Ye, please.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.039
Wait.

00:10:59.639 --> 00:11:00.200
This bag...

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:00.879
Give it to me.

00:11:01.519 --> 00:11:01.919
Yes.

00:11:03.399 --> 00:11:03.879
Captain Inoue.

00:11:03.879 --> 00:11:04.240
Yes.

00:11:04.519 --> 00:11:05.600
Transportation on the island is inconvenient.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:06.759
I need a vehicle.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:07.679
Understood.

00:11:07.679 --> 00:11:10.159
I will prepare a vehicle and driver for the Colonel immediately.

00:11:10.159 --> 00:11:11.679
Yes, understood.

00:11:11.679 --> 00:11:12.480
A driver will not be necessary.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.879
Alright, no driver.

00:11:13.879 --> 00:11:14.840
My apologies for the offense.

00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.360
Thank you. Farewell.

00:11:33.679 --> 00:11:34.279
Father.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:35.519
Father.

00:11:38.639 --> 00:11:39.720
I understand.

00:11:41.679 --> 00:11:42.639
Who is he?

00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:46.960
His name is Takeki Ichiro.

00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:49.159
A Japanese.

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:54.840
Dad.

00:11:55.399 --> 00:11:56.080
Biying.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.080
Put the luggage in my car for now.

00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.519
The other gun is with Luo Zhiyong.

00:12:01.639 --> 00:12:02.759
I'll go see my father first.

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:04.399
Dad.

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:09.840
Colonel.

00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:11.600
Commander Fujita is still waiting for you.

00:12:12.159 --> 00:12:12.480
Please.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:26.440
Has Sasaki returned yet?

00:12:28.120 --> 00:12:28.799
Right.

00:12:29.559 --> 00:12:30.320
He hasn't returned yet.

00:12:33.519 --> 00:12:34.440
Right.

00:12:35.919 --> 00:12:37.039
He's probably still in Tanjiawan Village.

00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:38.279
Searching the secret room.

00:12:38.279 --> 00:12:39.879
Should we send someone to tell him to come back immediately?

00:12:40.399 --> 00:12:41.440
Go ahead.

00:12:43.279 --> 00:12:43.759
Come back.

00:12:46.399 --> 00:12:49.240
Don't bother. Let him search.

00:12:52.759 --> 00:12:54.559
If Sasaki doesn't find anyone,

00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:56.879
and this Colonel complains to the Commander about it,

00:12:56.919 --> 00:12:58.720
I'm afraid headquarters will blame us.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.279
What's there to panic about?

00:13:00.279 --> 00:13:02.440
While this Colonel from the palace

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.519
is meeting with Commander Fujita,

00:13:03.519 --> 00:13:05.559
we'll raid the Ye family's nest.

00:13:05.559 --> 00:13:07.000
Seize the initiative.

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.159
This is our Special Police Corps' job.

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:12.440
What did you just say?

00:13:12.919 --> 00:13:15.960
You dare say we haven't caught anyone?

00:13:16.039 --> 00:13:16.600
Let me tell you,

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.360
if we really haven't caught anyone,

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:18.039
but if we do find someone,

00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:18.799
I'd like to see how this Colonel

00:13:18.799 --> 00:13:19.639
and that woman of his from the Ye family

00:13:19.639 --> 00:13:22.120
can still act so arrogantly.

00:13:22.120 --> 00:13:25.279
This is our Special Police Corps' job.

00:13:50.720 --> 00:13:51.960
Search thoroughly for me.

00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:53.200
Don't overlook any place.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.000
Yes!

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.600
All men, prepare!

00:14:08.720 --> 00:14:09.759
Prepare!

00:14:09.879 --> 00:14:11.240
The greatest threat to you

00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.120
is this Lieutenant General Fujita.

00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:15.399
He enjoys Japanese historical texts

00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:17.000
and also Chinese history.

00:14:17.159 --> 00:14:18.399
He's a China expert.

00:14:18.759 --> 00:14:19.360
This man served as

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:21.440
an assistant military attaché at the New York consulate.

00:14:21.639 --> 00:14:24.279
He's a rare historian within the Japanese Navy.

00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:25.720
He is very deep and calculating.

00:14:26.159 --> 00:14:28.120
If he sends a telegram to verify your identity,

00:14:28.320 --> 00:14:29.480
then the time until your exposure

00:14:29.679 --> 00:14:31.559
generally will not exceed forty-eight hours.

00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.440
You may consider aborting the mission

00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:34.639
and extracting immediately.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:54.320
Investigator of the Imperial Palace Investigation Office,

00:14:54.440 --> 00:14:55.600
Takeki Ichiro,

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:56.879
presents himself to Commander Fujita.

00:14:59.159 --> 00:15:02.600
It's a pleasure to meet you here.

00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:05.000
Sakamoto.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:05.639
Yes.

00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.559
I am Adjutant Sakamoto.

00:15:10.559 --> 00:15:11.200
We have already received

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.279
notification from the Shanghai garrison.

00:15:12.279 --> 00:15:13.559
We have been waiting for you here for some time.

00:15:15.919 --> 00:15:17.320
Commander, you must be tired.

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:29.200
An envoy from the palace.

00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:30.399
The purpose of your trip

00:15:30.399 --> 00:15:32.200
must be quite extraordinary.

00:15:34.879 --> 00:15:35.440
Come.

00:15:35.840 --> 00:15:36.559
This way, please.

00:15:52.679 --> 00:15:54.679
Even if you don't wish to say, I can guess.

00:15:54.799 --> 00:15:56.799
It's probably about the Osumi Mineo matter.

00:15:57.159 --> 00:15:57.600
In recent years,

00:15:57.600 --> 00:15:58.679
the only thing here that could alarm the palace

00:15:58.759 --> 00:16:00.039
is this one matter.

00:16:01.159 --> 00:16:02.159
Commander.

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:03.360
I believe Adjutant Sakamoto

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:04.360
will certainly be able to find me

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.639
a comfortable place to rest.

00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:07.759
Right.

00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:08.879
Sakamoto.

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:09.360
Yes.

00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:10.720
Go immediately and make arrangements for the envoy.

00:16:10.919 --> 00:16:11.919
Have the envoy stay at the headquarters.

00:16:11.919 --> 00:16:13.200
Being closer to me will facilitate communication.

00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.200
Commander.

00:16:14.679 --> 00:16:16.399
I think I'd prefer to stay at the airfield.

00:16:16.440 --> 00:16:17.279
The airfield garrison

00:16:17.279 --> 00:16:18.600
and all the pilots are stationed there.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:19.720
It will be more convenient for my work.

00:16:22.200 --> 00:16:23.120
I understand.

00:16:23.919 --> 00:16:25.320
Have the airfield garrison

00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:26.639
vacate a better quarters for the envoy's use.

00:16:26.639 --> 00:16:29.320
All provisions are to be according to my standard.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.200
Understood.

00:16:31.639 --> 00:16:32.480
Then let us go inside first.

00:16:32.480 --> 00:16:33.159
Yes.

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:48.679
Salute.

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:50.279
This way, please.

00:16:50.279 --> 00:16:50.879
Very well.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.320
Colonel, please have a seat.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:58.840
Yes.

00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:07.519
Sit.

00:17:07.519 --> 00:17:08.080
Good.

00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:20.200
Commander Fujita, I have one more thing to report.

00:17:20.200 --> 00:17:21.840
The Colonel is one of us.

00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:23.440
Go ahead.

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.639
Ye Degong has a letter for you.

00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:53.279
I heard you studied at the To Bun Gakuin.

00:17:53.279 --> 00:17:54.720
So you must be able to read Chinese.

00:17:54.720 --> 00:17:56.279
Yes, I understand some.

00:18:09.159 --> 00:18:09.720
Sakamoto.

00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:10.679
Yes.

00:18:10.679 --> 00:18:12.639
Has the Special Police Corps taken any action recently?

00:18:13.279 --> 00:18:14.440
They suspect...

00:18:14.679 --> 00:18:15.679
...that on the downed plane...

00:18:15.679 --> 00:18:17.600
...there might have been another American.

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.559
But this person has never been found.

00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.960
The Special Police Corps searched Tanjiawan Village...

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.360
...and every other village on the island.

00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:34.039
Colonel...

00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.880
How do you think such a matter should be handled?

00:18:36.359 --> 00:18:36.960
Your Excellency...

00:18:37.119 --> 00:18:38.319
I have just arrived on the island.

00:18:38.599 --> 00:18:39.880
Regarding the conflict between the islanders...

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:41.680
...and the garrison troops...

00:18:41.680 --> 00:18:42.880
...I cannot make a judgment.

00:18:43.559 --> 00:18:45.440
But if you are speaking of Ye Degong...

00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:48.279
...there is another matter I must report to you.

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:49.960
What is it?

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:53.440
This time, coming to the island with me...

00:18:53.440 --> 00:18:55.000
...was also a Chinese woman.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.480
Her name is Ye Biying.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.880
She is the daughter of this Ye Degong.

00:18:59.519 --> 00:19:01.359
The young man has good taste.

00:19:01.839 --> 00:19:03.000
That Ye Degong...

00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:04.880
...is a former Qing dynasty consul who returned from America.

00:19:05.839 --> 00:19:07.400
It's not like that.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.680
Your Excellency, Commander...

00:19:08.880 --> 00:19:10.039
I believed...

00:19:10.039 --> 00:19:11.960
...that having someone familiar with the island...

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.319
...would facilitate my investigation.

00:19:13.799 --> 00:19:14.599
So, in Shanghai...

00:19:14.599 --> 00:19:15.640
...I had them find someone for me.

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:17.000
It was the Wang Jingwei government...

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.559
...that assigned Miss Ye Biying to accompany me to the island.

00:19:19.799 --> 00:19:20.680
Therefore...

00:19:20.759 --> 00:19:22.480
...I hope that with her assistance...

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.279
...my investigation can proceed more smoothly.

00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:25.960
Not a bad idea.

00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:28.880
It is said that General Osumi Mineo's remains...

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:31.000
...were hidden by the local populace.

00:19:32.039 --> 00:19:32.960
In wartime...

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:34.519
...some things young people do...

00:19:34.519 --> 00:19:36.160
...are understandable.

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.319
Where is she now?

00:19:41.319 --> 00:19:42.680
As soon as she landed on the island...

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:44.960
...she was detained by the Special Police Corps.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.839
I just secured her release.

00:19:47.839 --> 00:19:48.799
People like Inoue Kamakura...

00:19:48.799 --> 00:19:50.440
...are more trouble than they're worth.

00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:52.200
They're suspicious of everything all day long.

00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:53.599
Who knows what they're really after.

00:19:55.079 --> 00:19:57.200
I've already met Captain Inoue.

00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:00.000
I'm afraid he now holds a deep grudge against me.

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.000
Your Excellency, Commander...

00:20:02.319 --> 00:20:03.039
Although I have now...

00:20:03.039 --> 00:20:04.440
...sent Miss Ye Biying and her father...

00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:06.400
...home together for a reunion...

00:20:07.559 --> 00:20:08.440
...nevertheless...

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.559
...considering the current situation...

00:20:10.559 --> 00:20:12.599
...I am still concerned for their safety.

00:20:14.559 --> 00:20:16.160
These brutes!

00:20:17.319 --> 00:20:18.559
I have repeatedly warned Inoue and the others...

00:20:18.559 --> 00:20:20.920
...not to take excessive action against the Ye family.

00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:23.720
Sakamoto.

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:24.480
Yes.

00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.279
Go to the Ye residence and invite Ye Degong...

00:20:30.279 --> 00:20:31.599
...to come to headquarters for dinner.

00:20:31.960 --> 00:20:33.200
Tell him I wish to discuss history...

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:33.960
...and appreciate the tea ceremony.

00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:34.680
Yes.

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.200
The old gentleman of the Ye family was once a diplomat.

00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.200
You must be courteous to him.

00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:38.759
Yes.

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:40.200
Isn't Interpreter Luo back?

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:41.160
Have him accompany you.

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:41.799
Yes.

00:20:42.319 --> 00:20:43.160
I shall take my leave now.

00:20:46.279 --> 00:20:48.279
My apologies for the unsightly display, Colonel.

00:20:48.519 --> 00:20:49.680
I am truly sorry.

00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.799
To have caused you so much trouble...

00:20:50.799 --> 00:20:52.480
...so soon after my arrival.

00:20:53.039 --> 00:20:55.519
I believe that with your support and assistance...

00:20:55.519 --> 00:20:56.599
...my investigation...

00:20:56.599 --> 00:20:58.119
...will certainly proceed smoothly.

00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:12.720
Your shoe fell off.

00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:18.119
How utterly embarrassing.

00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:20.480
It's indecent.

00:22:50.559 --> 00:22:51.359
Reporting, Captain.

00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:54.000
I think there's something wrong with that wall over there.

00:23:00.079 --> 00:23:01.680
That side is forty.

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:03.519
This side is eighty.

00:23:03.519 --> 00:23:04.319
See?

00:23:18.319 --> 00:23:18.920
Dad.

00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:22.319
Dad.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:26.559
Dad.

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.119
Your return is a major event.

00:23:42.119 --> 00:23:43.720
It's a joyous occasion.

00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.200
But you frightened me, you know that?

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:50.519
What you showed me was a girl...

00:23:50.519 --> 00:23:52.440
...dressed provocatively...

00:23:52.559 --> 00:23:55.680
...being intimate with a Japanese officer.

00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.039
I could choose not to be angry.

00:24:00.039 --> 00:24:01.079
I could choose not to reprimand you.

00:24:02.319 --> 00:24:04.960
But think, if your mother were still here...

00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:06.440
...and she saw you like this...

00:24:07.079 --> 00:24:08.559
...wouldn't her heart ache?

00:24:10.839 --> 00:24:11.880
Dad...

00:24:13.200 --> 00:24:14.759
...don't be like this.

00:24:16.039 --> 00:24:16.559
Alright, alright.

00:24:16.559 --> 00:24:18.240
Please don't talk like that.

00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:19.079
Fine.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.519
Acting cute won't work.

00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:24.079
I will definitely give you...

00:24:24.079 --> 00:24:25.079
...a reasonable explanation.

00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:30.119
Now you're even using diplomatic language.

00:24:30.799 --> 00:24:31.759
You've grown up.

00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:35.680
If the child is untaught, the father is at fault.

00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:38.079
I disciplined you strictly.

00:24:38.079 --> 00:24:39.160
I instructed you diligently.

00:24:41.519 --> 00:24:42.640
But no matter how much I thought...

00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:45.240
...I never imagined you'd deal me such a blow.

00:24:46.759 --> 00:24:48.599
In the end, the fault is still mine.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:51.400
Dad...

00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:52.559
...I'm sorry.

00:24:54.079 --> 00:24:54.759
Dad.

00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.480
I will think it over carefully.

00:25:02.880 --> 00:25:04.359
You think it over carefully too.

00:25:05.880 --> 00:25:07.640
I hope that when you enter the house...

00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:12.440
...you can return my daughter to me.

00:25:37.759 --> 00:25:38.599
Bring the tools over.

00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:48.279
Here.

00:25:51.319 --> 00:25:52.240
Make him behave.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:52.720
Yes.

00:25:58.880 --> 00:25:59.599
Xia'er.

00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:01.599
Xia'er

00:26:04.559 --> 00:26:05.519
What are you doing?

00:26:06.319 --> 00:26:07.799
What are you doing?

00:26:11.559 --> 00:26:12.279
Stop!

00:26:14.279 --> 00:26:14.960
Stop!

00:26:17.599 --> 00:26:18.240
Let him go!

00:26:19.599 --> 00:26:20.319
What is going on?

00:26:23.079 --> 00:26:23.599
Hey!

00:26:24.839 --> 00:26:25.839
Stop!

00:26:30.519 --> 00:26:31.400
Yingying

00:26:32.759 --> 00:26:33.240
Grandma Si

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:33.880
Ying'er

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:38.519
Inoue

00:26:39.079 --> 00:26:40.039
Did they let you go?

00:26:40.880 --> 00:26:41.319
Yes

00:26:42.599 --> 00:26:44.039
I advise you to stop immediately

00:26:44.279 --> 00:26:45.920
Colonel Takeki, who came back with me,

00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:47.440
has already gone to see your Commander Fujita.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:48.440
Stop talking

00:26:48.599 --> 00:26:49.079
Dad

00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.640
We have family matters to handle

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:55.400
Please go back

00:26:57.079 --> 00:26:59.039
I don't understand what you're saying

00:26:59.759 --> 00:27:00.400
I only know

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.960
I haven't received orders to retreat

00:27:05.319 --> 00:27:06.039
Smash the wall!

00:27:09.119 --> 00:27:09.759
What are you doing?

00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:11.359
You can't smash the wall!

00:27:11.359 --> 00:27:11.920
Stop!

00:27:11.920 --> 00:27:12.680
Let go of me!

00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:14.200
Stop!

00:27:15.799 --> 00:27:16.119
Stop!

00:27:16.119 --> 00:27:16.319
Dad!

00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:22.119
Stop!

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:23.440
Sasaki

00:27:31.319 --> 00:27:32.680
Greetings, Adjutant. What are you doing?

00:27:33.799 --> 00:27:36.119
I am just carrying out a mission

00:27:36.759 --> 00:27:37.440
A mission?

00:27:38.599 --> 00:27:40.000
That's a coincidence

00:27:40.559 --> 00:27:41.440
I also received a mission from Commander Fujita

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.440
to come here

00:27:50.039 --> 00:27:51.279
I apologize for the intrusion

00:27:54.319 --> 00:27:57.160
Commander Fujita invites Mr. Ye

00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.400
to the headquarters for dinner

00:28:00.880 --> 00:28:04.039
to drink tea and discuss history together

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:06.119
I am truly sorry

00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.279
The Commander invites you to dinner

00:28:08.279 --> 00:28:09.039
at the headquarters

00:28:09.039 --> 00:28:11.200
to drink tea and chat about history with him

00:28:11.839 --> 00:28:13.680
You've come to search our home two days in a row

00:28:13.680 --> 00:28:15.400
Turning our house upside down

00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:16.000
Dad

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:16.640
Don't listen to them

00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:18.119
They certainly have no good intentions

00:28:19.640 --> 00:28:20.680
The Commander's orders

00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:22.640
Wasn't it a search?

00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:28.319
Commander Fujita is sincerely inviting you

00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:30.440
The Commander says

00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.480
that both he and you served as diplomats in the US

00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.240
and there must be many

00:28:34.240 --> 00:28:35.000
common topics between you

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.119
Therefore, Commander Fujita asks that you please honor him with your presence

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:40.680
The Commander sincerely invites you

00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:43.160
He says both he and you were diplomats in the United States

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.480
and have much in common

00:28:44.480 --> 00:28:45.880
He hopes you will accept

00:28:47.559 --> 00:28:49.799
Thank you to the Commander for the sincere invitation

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:52.559
But please reply to His Excellency the Commander

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.759
My time as a consul was in the previous dynasty

00:28:57.319 --> 00:28:58.960
I no longer wish to recall

00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.240
events of the past

00:29:03.359 --> 00:29:04.640
As for history

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.759
we are in a time of war

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:08.359
and I do not wish to discuss it either

00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.319
As for Captain Sasaki

00:29:11.599 --> 00:29:13.160
claiming our home has a secret room

00:29:15.119 --> 00:29:17.039
he has already searched once

00:29:17.839 --> 00:29:18.839
Today

00:29:19.079 --> 00:29:20.799
he comes to smash my walls again

00:29:21.440 --> 00:29:23.440
Is this the attitude of an invitation?

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:34.440
Commander Fujita is very angry with the Police Corps

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:37.599
for their recent harassment of the Ye family

00:29:38.759 --> 00:29:40.519
You must go back and warn them

00:29:40.519 --> 00:29:41.680
not to be too aggressive

00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:47.079
Also, this daughter of the Ye family

00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:50.319
seems to be very close to the Colonel who just arrived

00:29:51.359 --> 00:29:53.000
Even Commander Fujita

00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.319
has to treat this Colonel with respect

00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.519
I advise you

00:29:57.680 --> 00:30:02.279
it is better not to provoke her

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.960
I am terribly sorry

00:30:13.319 --> 00:30:14.119
Mr. Ye

00:30:14.119 --> 00:30:15.400
Please consider it seriously

00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:17.119
Please do us the honor

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:20.480
Thank you for the Commander's invitation

00:30:21.359 --> 00:30:23.279
I still have family matters to attend to

00:30:23.279 --> 00:30:24.640
Let's talk about it another time

00:30:25.599 --> 00:30:26.920
The Ye family has matters to handle

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:27.960
Maybe next time

00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:34.920
What are you waiting for?

00:30:37.960 --> 00:30:38.920
Withdraw

00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:39.680
Yes, sir

00:30:49.240 --> 00:30:51.400
We will take our leave then

00:31:31.519 --> 00:31:32.039
Ying'er

00:31:32.200 --> 00:31:32.559
Grandma Si

00:31:32.559 --> 00:31:33.119
Yingying

00:31:33.119 --> 00:31:33.759
You really came back

00:31:53.359 --> 00:31:53.960
Dad

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:10.839
If you dare to come in

00:32:12.079 --> 00:32:13.720
I will assume you have thought it through

00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.319
Young people inevitably make mistakes when away

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:19.640
I can forgive you

00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.240
But

00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.599
you cannot make the same mistake again

00:32:26.200 --> 00:32:27.240
The island is in chaos right now

00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.200
You had better go out less

00:32:30.759 --> 00:32:31.440
But

00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:31.839
I

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:32.640
Grandma Si

00:32:34.119 --> 00:32:35.400
Take Ying'er back to her room

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:36.400
Help her tidy up

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:37.119
Okay

00:32:38.119 --> 00:32:39.000
Yingying

00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:39.880
Let's go, quickly

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:41.440
Grandma Si missed you so much

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.680
Ying'er, rest well today

00:33:04.839 --> 00:33:05.839
Didn't you arrange with Ju'er

00:33:05.839 --> 00:33:06.799
to get medicine?

00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:08.359
Right, right, right

00:33:08.359 --> 00:33:08.759
Yes

00:33:08.759 --> 00:33:09.519
Go quickly

00:33:09.799 --> 00:33:11.000
Okay, Dad. I'm going

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:21.000
While General Osumi Mineo was staying in Guangzhou,

00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:23.119
he received an order from the Army Ministry.

00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:25.319
Appointing him as the commander

00:33:25.319 --> 00:33:27.920
of the newly formed Japanese South Pacific Fleet.

00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:28.960
You know,

00:33:29.119 --> 00:33:31.880
how much power a Combined Fleet commander holds.

00:33:32.079 --> 00:33:33.359
But right at this moment,

00:33:33.799 --> 00:33:35.599
General Osumi suddenly met with an accident.

00:33:35.799 --> 00:33:38.640
It's inevitable that His Majesty the Emperor would become suspicious.

00:33:40.519 --> 00:33:41.359
Yes.

00:33:42.599 --> 00:33:44.359
I heard the South Pacific Fleet

00:33:44.359 --> 00:33:46.960
plans to establish its headquarters on Hainan Island.

00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:49.680
For this, Vice Admiral Sunagawa Kaneo

00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:51.839
and Rear Admiral Utsunomiya Kanji

00:33:51.839 --> 00:33:54.480
have already set up the Hainan Guard District.

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:55.960
They were just waiting for General Osumi Mineo to take up his post.

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:56.839
What a pity.

00:33:57.640 --> 00:33:58.759
You certainly must know

00:33:59.039 --> 00:33:59.759
the Southern Expansion Faction

00:33:59.759 --> 00:34:00.680
and the Northern Expansion Faction

00:34:01.079 --> 00:34:02.319
have been fiercely arguing within the Army Ministry, Navy Ministry,

00:34:02.319 --> 00:34:05.240
and even before the Emperor.

00:34:05.680 --> 00:34:07.400
General Osumi Mineo, because of this,

00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.519
suffered several assassination attempts.

00:34:13.599 --> 00:34:15.440
Was it done by someone from our own side?

00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:27.039
There's another highly confidential matter

00:34:27.039 --> 00:34:29.759
I feel it's necessary for you to know.

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:32.440
Right when General Osumi had the accident,

00:34:32.480 --> 00:34:34.759
he was carrying an important document.

00:34:35.240 --> 00:34:37.079
It was a "Record of the Imperial Conference."

00:34:37.079 --> 00:34:38.720
This "Record of the Imperial Conference"

00:34:39.319 --> 00:34:40.759
existed in only seven copies.

00:34:41.880 --> 00:34:42.799
Only the Emperor,

00:34:43.039 --> 00:34:43.880
the Prime Minister,

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.839
and the Army and Navy chiefs had them.

00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:47.359
But at the accident scene,

00:34:47.599 --> 00:34:49.039
this document also disappeared.

00:34:51.079 --> 00:34:51.640
Is that so?

00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.000
There was such a confidential document too.

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:55.279
Therefore,

00:34:55.519 --> 00:34:57.200
the order I received this time

00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.880
is to investigate thoroughly, no matter what,

00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:01.480
the truth behind General Osumi's plane crash.

00:35:01.640 --> 00:35:03.799
Additionally, to retrieve that document.

00:35:06.880 --> 00:35:07.880
I understand.

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:09.799
Our base will fully cooperate

00:35:09.799 --> 00:35:10.960
with the Special Envoy's investigation.

00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:12.119
Please rest assured.

00:35:12.799 --> 00:35:13.440
Yes.

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:33.200
Your Chief Aide-de-Camp is Hasunuma Shigeru, right?

00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.559
I know him.

00:35:34.559 --> 00:35:35.119
Yes.

00:35:36.319 --> 00:35:37.480
The Army Ministry and Navy Ministry

00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.760
have been bickering noisily for many years.

00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:42.679
One wants to advance north,

00:35:42.679 --> 00:35:44.079
the other wants to advance south.

00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:46.079
Now there's no need to argue.

00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:47.559
His Majesty adopted the Southern Expansion Faction's opinion,

00:35:47.559 --> 00:35:48.639
thoroughly bombing Pearl Harbor.

00:35:48.639 --> 00:35:49.679
On the same day, occupying Hong Kong, China.

00:35:49.679 --> 00:35:51.039
Then, spreading out fully,

00:35:51.039 --> 00:35:53.320
the war ignited across the entire Pacific and Southeast Asia.

00:35:54.039 --> 00:35:56.559
You are close to His Majesty.

00:35:57.199 --> 00:35:58.360
You often shuttle between the Navy Ministry, Naval General Staff,

00:35:58.960 --> 00:35:59.599
the Naval Districts,

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.639
and the Army's General Staff Office.

00:36:02.119 --> 00:36:03.519
I'd like to hear your view.

00:36:04.079 --> 00:36:05.039
Commander, sir.

00:36:05.039 --> 00:36:07.800
Do you want to hear the view consistent with newspapers and documents,

00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:09.960
or my personal view?

00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.719
Of course, it's the private view between you and me.

00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:14.360
Yes.

00:36:20.800 --> 00:36:25.280
It will increase greatly.

00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:30.199
You think this Colonel Takeki also has problems?

00:36:30.719 --> 00:36:31.840
I don't know if he has problems.

00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:33.559
I just remembered

00:36:35.159 --> 00:36:37.039
my psychology when playing cards.

00:36:40.719 --> 00:36:41.480
What psychology?

00:36:42.159 --> 00:36:45.039
When I'm holding a bad hand,

00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:47.639
I will bluff,

00:36:48.079 --> 00:36:53.119
pretending to be overbearing,

00:36:53.119 --> 00:36:54.920
completely intending to fool my opponent.

00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.000
You mean

00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.400
Colonel Takeki's credentials are problematic?

00:37:01.159 --> 00:37:02.280
I only know that

00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:05.239
if this person is holding a good hand...

00:37:05.239 --> 00:37:06.719
What kind of hand is this?

00:37:06.719 --> 00:37:07.480
He will definitely give his opponent a feeling

00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:08.480
of having bad luck.

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.039
He often hides

00:37:10.039 --> 00:37:12.559
his truest feelings and confidence.

00:37:18.599 --> 00:37:20.760
Should we investigate Colonel Takeki?

00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.840
How?

00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:27.360
We can't very well

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:30.360
send a telegram to His Majesty the Emperor and the Prime Minister

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:32.880
to verify their investigator's identity, can we?

00:37:33.599 --> 00:37:34.719
Then we can't do anything about him.

00:37:34.719 --> 00:37:36.320
Even if we

00:37:37.159 --> 00:37:38.920
can't telegraph the Emperor and Prime Minister...

00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:40.320
Therefore, we can start investigating from that woman.

00:37:41.519 --> 00:37:43.519
Start from the woman?

00:37:43.519 --> 00:37:44.119
Yes.

00:37:46.719 --> 00:37:48.760
The Pearl River Estuary here is like spring all year round.

00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:50.440
It's truly a good place.

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:54.320
The base has fresh fruit all year round.

00:37:55.199 --> 00:37:56.000
Please, enjoy.

00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:56.400
Good.

00:37:59.000 --> 00:37:59.719
Thank you.

00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:07.800
It's truly delicious.

00:38:11.199 --> 00:38:12.000
Commander.

00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:13.679
In my humble opinion,

00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:15.440
the naval strength of the United States

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.280
is superior to our own naval strength.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:18.559
Although we

00:38:18.559 --> 00:38:20.000
launched a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor

00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.480
and essentially destroyed

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.719
the U.S. Pacific Fleet,

00:38:22.719 --> 00:38:23.840
this has made the officers of the Southern Expansion Faction

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:24.880
somewhat overconfident.

00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:27.000
They think American naval power is nothing special.

00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:31.519
Many admirals in the navy do not share this view.

00:38:32.119 --> 00:38:33.639
The United States has formally declared war on us.

00:38:34.159 --> 00:38:35.280
Our Kwantung Army

00:38:35.280 --> 00:38:36.800
has fourteen divisions,

00:38:36.800 --> 00:38:38.639
over 1.3 million men,

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.639
yet we dare not transfer a single division

00:38:40.639 --> 00:38:42.679
to join the southern campaign.

00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.880
We can only continuously conscript from the homeland.

00:38:45.559 --> 00:38:46.719
Just before I came here,

00:38:46.719 --> 00:38:48.360
a new conscription order was issued.

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:49.880
The upper age limit for conscription

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:51.440
has now reached fifty-five.

00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.559
Indeed.

00:38:54.559 --> 00:38:56.400
This matter is enough to worry His Majesty.

00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.119
Our entire homeland defense now

00:38:58.119 --> 00:38:59.760
consists of only three divisions.

00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:02.280
The rest are useless reservists.

00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:04.920
If any unforeseen situation arises,

00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:06.920
I fear there will be major trouble.

00:39:09.119 --> 00:39:11.440
Truly worthy of being by His Majesty's side.

00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:13.239
Your perspective on matters is indeed different.

00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:17.480
Our attack on Pearl Harbor

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.199
has thoroughly enraged America.

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:20.719
It is a massive

00:39:20.719 --> 00:39:24.639
combined naval, land, and air combat force.

00:39:24.639 --> 00:39:26.159
America's industrial capacity

00:39:26.159 --> 00:39:27.960
far exceeds our own.

00:39:27.960 --> 00:39:29.840
Imagine two years from now,

00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:32.239
our army's artillery and navy's ships

00:39:32.239 --> 00:39:33.559
are continuously lost in battle and cannot be replaced.

00:39:33.559 --> 00:39:34.880
But American factories,

00:39:34.880 --> 00:39:36.280
running at full capacity,

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.840
produce new artillery and new ships,

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:39.679
creating new troubles.

00:39:39.679 --> 00:39:40.679
By that time,

00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:42.559
I truly dare not imagine

00:39:42.559 --> 00:39:44.360
what situation we will face.

00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:49.440
The Naval General Staff has done something

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.199
that made Roosevelt, Churchill,

00:39:51.199 --> 00:39:51.800
and China's Chiang Kai-shek

00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:52.800
all very happy.

00:39:54.159 --> 00:39:54.960
Last month, I met

00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.119
Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto.

00:39:56.559 --> 00:39:58.079
His concerns are the same as yours.

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.159
Truly worthy of being a staff officer at Supreme Headquarters.

00:40:00.719 --> 00:40:01.760
Your vision is indeed broad.

00:40:01.760 --> 00:40:02.800
It's truly different.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:05.159
Only by swiftly completing

00:40:05.159 --> 00:40:05.960
operations across the entire China theater,

00:40:06.599 --> 00:40:08.119
and transferring all main forces here

00:40:08.119 --> 00:40:09.280
to the Pacific battlefield,

00:40:10.079 --> 00:40:11.239
can we ensure that two years from now,

00:40:11.239 --> 00:40:12.800
the Japanese homeland remains safe.

00:40:19.320 --> 00:40:21.280
Pardon me, sir.

00:40:21.719 --> 00:40:22.719
Following your instructions,

00:40:22.719 --> 00:40:23.400
I went to invite Ye Degong.

00:40:23.400 --> 00:40:24.199
But he refused.

00:40:26.079 --> 00:40:30.000
Also, the Special Police Corps has withdrawn.

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:31.599
I understand.

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:32.760
You may leave.

00:40:33.039 --> 00:40:33.360
Yes.

00:40:33.599 --> 00:40:34.559
I take my leave.

00:40:35.159 --> 00:40:36.559
This must be the interpreter, Mr. Luo.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:38.480
My female assistant.

00:40:38.480 --> 00:40:40.039
And there is something in your possession.

00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:44.000
So you are Colonel Takeki.

00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.280
I've long intended to return this to you in person.

00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.480
I simply forgot for a moment.

00:40:56.639 --> 00:40:57.960
Thank you for keeping it for her.

00:41:00.719 --> 00:41:02.840
If Colonel Takeki hadn't mentioned it,

00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.719
you probably wouldn't have returned it voluntarily.

00:41:05.400 --> 00:41:06.039
Commander.

00:41:06.320 --> 00:41:07.239
I truly wouldn't dare.

00:41:09.360 --> 00:41:10.400
Bring that here.

00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:11.000
Yes.

00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:13.480
The noble man is open and at ease.

00:41:13.480 --> 00:41:14.679
The petty man is always full of anxiety.

00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:19.199
Swat fifty flies.

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:21.880
Arrange them neatly.

00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:24.079
After I finish my discussion with the Colonel,

00:41:24.079 --> 00:41:25.000
I will personally come to inspect.

00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:25.559
Yes.

00:41:26.239 --> 00:41:26.559
Get out.

00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:27.280
Yes.

00:41:36.519 --> 00:41:38.400
He is a fly

00:41:38.840 --> 00:41:39.920
that has infiltrated our army.

00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:40.639
Yes.

00:41:41.719 --> 00:41:42.320
Sakamoto.

00:41:42.519 --> 00:41:42.679
Yes.

00:41:43.079 --> 00:41:44.400
There's one more thing I'd like to ask of you.

00:41:44.719 --> 00:41:45.639
Please go to my car

00:41:45.639 --> 00:41:47.119
and fetch a green cloth bag.

00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:48.159
As you command.

00:41:48.159 --> 00:41:48.760
Thank you.

00:41:55.840 --> 00:41:59.000
That woman was born on this island.

00:41:59.519 --> 00:42:00.880
On the island,

00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:03.880
there should be someone familiar with her situation.

00:42:06.519 --> 00:42:08.800
If you put it that way,

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.960
our military hospital has a nurse,

00:42:13.599 --> 00:42:14.400
Tang Ju'er.

00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:15.280
Tang Ju'er.

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.400
She's about the same age as this Ye Biying.

00:42:19.079 --> 00:42:20.840
She should know something.

00:42:21.599 --> 00:42:22.480
Indeed.

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:26.440
You mean the daughter of that Tang Bingchen?

00:42:26.639 --> 00:42:27.000
Yes.

00:42:27.400 --> 00:42:28.840
They should know each other.
