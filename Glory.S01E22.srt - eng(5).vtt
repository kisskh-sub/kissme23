00:01:26.530 --> 00:01:29.789
[Glory]

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.960
[Episode 22]

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.229
The whereabouts of Madam Yang

00:01:36.229 --> 00:01:37.920
was deliberately passed on to me.

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.430
Someone in the Rong family wants
to harm you.

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:41.890
You'd better make
preparations in advance.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.840
Mr. Yan is a true gentleman.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:54.190
He is a perfect match for you.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:57.220
Bao, I really must leave now.

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.950
Please take good care of yourself.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:03.480
Young Master.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.000
Young Master!

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:06.480
My dear niece,

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:07.890
I will take my leave now.

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.290
Don't listen to his nonsense.

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:26.600
I understand.

00:02:27.490 --> 00:02:29.290
Mr. Wen speaks his mind frankly.

00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:31.560
Lady Shanbao,
please don't take it to heart.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:34.190
Now that the Wei case is already settled,

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.030
Madam Yang...

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.970
She says she is done with worldly affairs

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.700
and has no attachment
to this world anymore.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.560
In three days, she will take vows
at Jijian Nunnery.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:47.670
She's becoming a nun?

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.590
The Emperor has issued an imperial edict,

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:12.700
appointing you
as the new Prefect of Linji.

00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:14.940
So many wealthy families
have hosted banquets,

00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:16.340
vying for your presence.

00:03:16.630 --> 00:03:17.750
Introduction letters for potential matches

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:18.520
have been flooding in,

00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:20.050
piling up at your doorstep.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.079
Women of every grace and charm

00:03:21.079 --> 00:03:22.520
are all within your reach.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.320
Why must you suffer here in vain?

00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.420
You know she will surely come?

00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:29.370
Madam Yang will take vows
at Jijian Nunnery.

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:31.430
She will surely come to see Madam Yang.

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.030
The Rong family sees you
as a mortal enemy,

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.960
desperate to eliminate you at all costs.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:36.420
Even if she comes, so what?

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.190
Do you really think
she could ever forgive you?

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:39.870
As the saying goes,
there are plenty of fish...

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:40.520
You only know the saying

00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.310
that there are plenty of fish in the sea.

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.970
Yet you miss the painful truth

00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.190
that sometimes

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.850
you just can't get over the one
that has got away.

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.240
As for what's between her and me,

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.240
even if I told you, a blockhead like you

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.170
wouldn't get it.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.250
I won't waste my breath on you.

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:02.870
Ms. Liang.

00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:04.360
Ms. Liang.

00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:05.090
Lady Yunwan.

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.590
Ms. Liang, why are you ignoring me?

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.280
Ms. Liang!

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:10.360
Ms. Liang!

00:04:10.470 --> 00:04:12.280
-Lady Yunwan.
-Ms. Liang, look at me!

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.520
Ms. Liang, look at me!

00:04:14.230 --> 00:04:14.960
Lady Yunwan.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:15.750
Ms. Liang!

00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:16.870
Lady Yunwan.

00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.269
Let me go!

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:21.680
-Ms. Liang!
-It's all right.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.540
It's all right.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:24.920
Ms. Liang!

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:25.920
Lady Yunwan.

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:27.510
Ms. Liang!

00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:30.920
-Ms. Liang!
-It's all right.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.050
Everything's fine.

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:33.360
Ms. Liang!

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.310
Ms. Liang!

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.040
Ms. Liang!

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.600
Ms. Liang!

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.450
Lady Yunwan.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:52.510
Ms. Liang!

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.680
Let me go!

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:01.870
-It's all right.
-Ms. Liang!

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:02.750
It's all right.

00:05:17.720 --> 00:05:18.520
Lady Shanbao.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:20.270
I've tried my best,

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:22.470
but I still can't persuade Lady Yunwan.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:24.870
She refuses to go down the mountain
with us.

00:05:26.670 --> 00:05:28.470
Let her stay here a while longer.

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:49.870
Godmother,

00:05:51.870 --> 00:05:53.870
I hope that for the rest of your life,

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:56.020
you'll be free from worry and resentment,

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:57.950

That's not enough!

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:24.610
Swear it on your life and future.

00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:27.070

a shortened life

00:07:39.750 --> 00:07:40.340

00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:44.580
Go back now.

00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:46.280
And do not come to see me again.

00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:48.360

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:49.020

I've never feared any karmic retribution.

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.380
Bao, since you are afraid,

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:29.950
I'll take an oath right here,
in front of the Bodhisattva.

00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:32.549
If there truly is karmic reward
for good deeds in this world,

00:08:32.549 --> 00:08:34.750
Bodhisattva, I pray you grant Lady Shanbao

00:08:34.750 --> 00:08:37.150
blessings, longevity, peace and health.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:38.960
As for the bitter retribution

00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.669
of a shortened life and a terrible death,

00:08:40.669 --> 00:08:42.000
let me bear it all alone.

00:08:48.150 --> 00:08:49.550
If you stop pestering me,

00:08:49.980 --> 00:08:51.320
that will be my karmic reward.

00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:51.780
Let go of me.

00:08:51.780 --> 00:08:52.380
I won't!

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:53.640
Lu Jianglai.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.200
Now that you've taken the road
to high office,

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.670
you can't come to see me anymore.

00:08:57.670 --> 00:08:58.840
You can't have it both ways.

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.390
To hell with high office!

00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:02.480
Had I wanted power and fortune,

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:02.910
I wouldn't have cared

00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:04.570
about the fate of the Wei clan.

00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:05.320
Yes,

00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:07.910
I am ruthless

00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:09.270
and calculating.

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:10.360
But if I don't want to collude

00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:12.390
with those corrupt
and incompetent officials,

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:13.120
I must be

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.380
more cunning than them

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.240
to beat them at their own game

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.900
and secure the justice I seek.

00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:19.090
Bao, you're right.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:21.590
I want to have it both ways.

00:09:22.120 --> 00:09:23.720
I will see this case through to the end.

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.200
And...

00:09:25.360 --> 00:09:26.620
I will never let you go.

00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.060
You can beat me or kill me as you please.

00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:30.260
But even if I die,

00:09:30.610 --> 00:09:32.480
my spirit will cling to you
and never let you go.

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.000
Even if you summon

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.630
every god in heaven to your side,

00:09:34.630 --> 00:09:36.490
you still won't be able to stop me.

00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:45.670
Good.

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:47.840
You said it.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:50.320
On that misty mountain peak,

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.120
there's an ancient wild tea tree

00:09:52.630 --> 00:09:54.030
growing on a steep cliff.

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.910
It's bathed in the essence
of sun and moon

00:09:55.910 --> 00:09:57.550
and nurtured by the spirit
of mountains and rivers.

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:59.750
Legend says its tea can cure dysentery,

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:02.320
making the tea leaves
more valuable than gold.

00:10:02.320 --> 00:10:03.960
During every tea-picking season,

00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.390
many mountain folk risk their lives
to climb the peak for the leaves.

00:10:06.390 --> 00:10:08.590
Scarcely one in ten makes it back alive.

00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:10.080
If you get the leaves yourself

00:10:10.080 --> 00:10:11.510
and bring them to me,

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.390
no matter how grave your mistakes
have been,

00:10:13.390 --> 00:10:14.990
we can still work things out.

00:10:15.390 --> 00:10:16.590
Do you really mean it?

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.960
You're not just saying that?

00:10:22.950 --> 00:10:24.010
Every word is true.

00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:28.570
Good. I will definitely get them for you.

00:10:48.830 --> 00:10:50.120
It has been two days

00:10:50.630 --> 00:10:52.230
since we parted at the court.

00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:54.440
I just want you to know

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.130
I've been thinking of you.

00:11:01.870 --> 00:11:02.870
It's alright now.

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.910
I've missed the best hour
for tea-picking today.

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:08.440
I'll go up the mountain
first thing tomorrow.

00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:09.150
Wait for me.

00:11:53.790 --> 00:11:54.840
Lady Rong Shanbao

00:11:55.270 --> 00:11:56.840
really knows how to make people suffer.

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.390
We've asked every hunter
at the foot of the mountain,

00:11:58.390 --> 00:11:59.910
but none of them has ever heard

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:01.840
of any tea tree on the mountain top.

00:12:01.840 --> 00:12:03.270
This is probably a wild goose chase,

00:12:03.270 --> 00:12:04.720
but you're taking it seriously!

00:12:04.720 --> 00:12:06.490
Beauty is but skin deep.

00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:08.200
All passions are phantoms,

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.600
yet you're just blinded!

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.390
If the tea tree really grows
on that sheer cliff,

00:12:11.390 --> 00:12:13.190
then she's asking for your life!

00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.150
In this life,

00:12:14.630 --> 00:12:16.080
fame, fortune, glory and wealth

00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:17.340
are all just phantoms.

00:12:18.030 --> 00:12:19.360
To fulfill my lofty ambitions,

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:21.120
I can endure ten years
of shame and humiliation,

00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:22.440
living in austerity and privation.

00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:22.910
For my beloved,

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:24.720
a little suffering
is a small price to pay.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.360
If Rong Shanbao

00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.490
truly wants my life,

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:28.670
then she'll have to offer
something far more precious in return.

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:29.720
Something more precious?

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.780
What would that be?

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:34.840
Her heart,

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.120
the rest of her life

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:37.450
and everything she has.

00:12:38.150 --> 00:12:39.610
I'll accept nothing less.

00:12:40.030 --> 00:12:41.200
You're quite black-hearted.

00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.600
You two are truly a match.

00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:45.450
Let me rest for a while.

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.000
Just a moment.

00:12:48.390 --> 00:12:49.850
I told you not to follow me.

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:50.670
Once it's past 9 AM,

00:12:50.670 --> 00:12:52.390
I'll miss the best time for tea-picking.

00:12:52.390 --> 00:12:53.120
I can't wait.

00:12:53.870 --> 00:12:54.670
Wait for me!

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:57.630
What is this?

00:13:03.050 --> 00:13:04.030
You damn monkey.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.320
You damn monkey!

00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:07.800
How dare you duck!

00:13:08.870 --> 00:13:09.270
I...

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:11.670
Wait for me!

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.050
Where's Lord Lu?

00:13:20.390 --> 00:13:21.720
He went up the mountain.

00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:52.800
♪ Get caught in a heavy, wild snowfall ♪

00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:56.610

I will sever all ties with him

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:06.960
♪ Wait for a perfectly full moon ♪

00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:08.160

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:09.570
That's not enough!

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:10.270
♪ Yet every slice of it seems incomplete ♪

00:15:10.270 --> 00:15:11.270

♪ Is it because my prayers

you are not worthy to be a daughter
of our Rong family.

♪ Put an end to all karmic ties and sins ♪

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:17.850
Why the hesitation?

00:16:20.510 --> 00:16:21.440
Why are you here?

00:16:23.030 --> 00:16:24.440
Grandmother ordered you
to kneel in the ancestral hall.

00:16:24.440 --> 00:16:25.300
What was it for?

00:16:26.270 --> 00:16:27.240
She wanted you to see

00:16:27.240 --> 00:16:28.840
the fate of that wretched servant.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.120
In the past, anyone who dared to sell

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:33.030
the salt or gold mines
their tribe depended on

00:16:33.030 --> 00:16:34.670
would be tried and hanged publicly.

00:16:34.670 --> 00:16:36.510
Even if the chief's husband
betrayed the tribe,

00:16:36.510 --> 00:16:38.200
he would be thrown into a scorpion pit,

00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:39.800
his survival left to chance.

00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:42.440
He was a spy
who infiltrated the Rong family

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.590
to gather information.

00:16:43.590 --> 00:16:45.190
It was you who saved his life.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:47.240
Even if he falls and shatters to pieces,

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:49.370
it'll only be repaying his debt to you.

00:16:50.270 --> 00:16:51.670
If you can't bear to do it,

00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:53.190
I can do it on your behalf.

00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:58.720
It's not that I can't bear to do it.

00:16:59.120 --> 00:17:00.120
Still denying it?

00:17:02.200 --> 00:17:04.680
You are not the only daughter
of the Rong family.

00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.210
If you hesitate any longer,

00:17:06.750 --> 00:17:09.150
you will surely ruin the important matter.

00:17:10.750 --> 00:17:12.010
Think about my mother.

00:17:12.510 --> 00:17:13.349
Grandmother doted on her

00:17:13.349 --> 00:17:14.480
beyond all measure.

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:16.550
But since she insisted
on marrying far from home,

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:17.500
for all these years,

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.160
has Grandmother ever mentioned her
even once?

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:20.640
She was no longer part of the Rong family.

00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:22.589
After she died, she couldn't be buried
in the family grave.

00:17:22.589 --> 00:17:23.750
Even I, as her daughter,

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:25.079
become an outsider now,

00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:28.480
not worthy of being recorded
in the genealogy.

00:17:29.640 --> 00:17:30.510
So what?

00:17:31.610 --> 00:17:32.410
So what?

00:17:38.350 --> 00:17:39.200
Rong Shanbao.

00:17:39.550 --> 00:17:41.110
When you were 13 or 14,

00:17:41.370 --> 00:17:43.320
you followed the tea caravan to the border
for training.

00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:45.640
In three years, you only stayed home
for 20 days.

00:17:45.640 --> 00:17:47.480
Driving camels, judging horses
and speaking tribal tongues...

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:48.740
You mastered them all.

00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.130
Once, you got separated from the caravan.

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:52.590
You fought tooth and nail
to find a water source,

00:17:52.590 --> 00:17:53.160
and on your own, led

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:55.020
several camels back to the group.

00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:56.590
Not a single item was lost.

00:17:56.590 --> 00:17:58.270
You even traded tea bricks for 30 sheep,

00:17:58.270 --> 00:17:59.790
earning 100 extra taels of silver.

00:17:59.790 --> 00:18:01.240
Back then,
whenever Grandmother mentioned you,

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:02.840
she was bursting with pride.

00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:04.270
But now?

00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:06.240
For Lu Jianglai

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:08.270
and an outsider like Madam Yang,

00:18:08.270 --> 00:18:10.350
you willingly turned your back
on Grandmother.

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:10.960
You have failed

00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.680
the Rong family that has spared no effort
to cultivate you.

00:18:12.680 --> 00:18:13.270
You have failed

00:18:13.270 --> 00:18:15.030
the tea farmers
who worship you as the Tea Bone.

00:18:15.030 --> 00:18:16.110
Most of all, you've

00:18:16.110 --> 00:18:17.270
failed yourself!

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:25.270
Whether family honor
or personal romance

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.220
weighs more heavily

00:18:28.510 --> 00:18:30.170
is for you to decide yourself.

00:18:40.240 --> 00:18:40.900
Xiangling.

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:44.210
This isn't about family honor

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:45.810
and personal romance.

00:18:46.910 --> 00:18:49.430
Yes, I am upset with Lu Jianglai.

00:18:50.440 --> 00:18:51.590
I'm angry that he acted on his own

00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:52.520
and deceived me.

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:56.230
But he didn't do anything wrong.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.400
He infiltrated the Rong family
to investigate a case.

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.440
He was willing to set me aside temporarily

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.040
for the justice in his heart,

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:06.090
just as I did for my godmother.

00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.740
Knowing the grievances she carried,

00:19:08.750 --> 00:19:09.920
I set aside all favor temporarily

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:11.110
to protect her.

00:19:12.030 --> 00:19:13.230
So about this matter,

00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:14.770
though I'm angry with him,

00:19:15.270 --> 00:19:16.720
I understand him.

00:19:18.070 --> 00:19:19.070
I'm grateful that

00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:20.790
on this point,

00:19:21.510 --> 00:19:22.710
he and I see eye to eye.

00:19:24.590 --> 00:19:25.990
The Rong family and Linji

00:19:26.070 --> 00:19:28.310
are interdependent
like branches and leaves.

00:19:28.310 --> 00:19:30.960
I'm guarding the Rong family's future,

00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:34.360
while he's protecting Linji's future.

00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:36.860
If Linji falls into darkness,

00:19:37.550 --> 00:19:39.680
the Rong family
will also be plunged into darkness.

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:40.680
Isn't that right?

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.840
I know you care for me,

00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:48.100
and that you hope

00:19:48.100 --> 00:19:49.880
once I become the head of the Rong family,

00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:51.350
I'll help you reclaim your surname

00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:53.350
and have your name recorded
in our genealogy.

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:55.670
Xiangling, I will keep the promise

00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:57.550
I made to you.

00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:15.460
Let's go back.

00:21:09.550 --> 00:21:10.270
Ms. Liang.

00:21:12.790 --> 00:21:13.550
I picked all these

00:21:13.550 --> 00:21:14.510
from the backyard.

00:21:14.510 --> 00:21:15.970
Look, aren't they pretty?

00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:17.510
They are.

00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:20.120
This leaf is even prettier.

00:21:20.750 --> 00:21:21.920
Look at it.

00:21:28.070 --> 00:21:29.000
Lady Yunwan.

00:21:30.270 --> 00:21:31.930
By the stream at the back hill,

00:21:32.030 --> 00:21:33.940
there's a beautiful red maple tree,

00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:36.440
more splendid than spring flowers
in February.

00:21:36.440 --> 00:21:38.030
Could you pick a leaf for me?

00:21:38.670 --> 00:21:39.480
Please?

00:21:41.590 --> 00:21:43.920
Wait for me, Ms. Liang.
I'll be right back.

00:21:44.850 --> 00:21:45.480
Wanwan.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:10.960
Watch your step. Don't trip and fall.

00:22:25.490 --> 00:22:30.810
[Rong Mansion]

00:22:35.030 --> 00:22:36.890
Lord Lu, you've come at a bad time.

00:22:37.510 --> 00:22:39.550
There's an outbreak of tea plant disease
in the plantations after the rain.

00:22:39.550 --> 00:22:41.400
Lady Shanbao
has gone up to the tea mountain.

00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.550
Based on previous years,

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:43.640
she might be gone for 3 to 5 days,

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:45.300
or even 10 days to half a month.

00:22:45.430 --> 00:22:47.430
It's impossible to say for certain.

00:22:47.510 --> 00:22:49.270
I dare not have you wait in vain, My Lord.

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:50.640
Save these excuses.

00:22:51.590 --> 00:22:52.480
I've had a prior arrangement

00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.540
with Lady Shanbao.

00:22:54.400 --> 00:22:56.060
Just take this basket inside.

00:22:56.350 --> 00:22:57.610
And tell her I have a way

00:22:58.070 --> 00:22:59.510
to bring the cliff tea
she's been longing for

00:22:59.510 --> 00:23:00.750
down from the mountain.

00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:02.610
She will naturally come to see me.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.060
Take it inside now.

00:23:36.270 --> 00:23:38.030
The marten fur cloak
you just started wearing yesterday

00:23:38.030 --> 00:23:39.690
got torn as soon as we went out.

00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:40.680
What a pity!

00:23:41.510 --> 00:23:42.440
Actually, this old one

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:44.030
is more comfortable to wear.

00:23:44.030 --> 00:23:45.110
The late autumn air is quite cold.

00:23:45.110 --> 00:23:46.720
The old one isn't warm enough.

00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:47.750
I'm just worried that you'll

00:23:47.750 --> 00:23:48.640
catch a chill.

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.130
What's this for?

00:23:53.550 --> 00:23:54.550
Mr. Yan,

00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:55.590
someone delivered this

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:57.110
to our gate early this morning

00:23:57.110 --> 00:23:59.510
Steward Cheng just told me
to throw it away.

00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:01.440
There are quite a few

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:02.790
freshly cut twigs inside it.

00:24:02.790 --> 00:24:03.790
Why throw it away?

00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:05.380
This...

00:24:05.870 --> 00:24:06.670
Leave it to me.

00:24:38.510 --> 00:24:39.770
What are you two doing?

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:43.200
Lady Shanbao.

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.330
I told you not to meddle.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.380
These cuttings need to be planted
at a slant.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:54.790
But I did everything

00:24:54.790 --> 00:24:57.120
exactly as you instructed, Young Master.

00:24:59.030 --> 00:25:01.290
Mr. Yan, you're an expert at growing tea,

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:02.510
yet you have an attendant

00:25:02.510 --> 00:25:04.510
who knows next to nothing about tea.

00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:06.820
Watch closely.

00:25:10.750 --> 00:25:12.880
The northwest wind
is blowing strong right now.

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:15.960
We should position the leaves
so that they follow the wind direction.

00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.310
If the wind is too strong,
the leaves will fall off.

00:25:18.310 --> 00:25:20.310
The leaf buds on this branch
aren't full enough.

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:22.550
It's difficult for the cutting
to take root.

00:25:22.550 --> 00:25:22.920
I...

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.920
Wild tea trees grow on steep cliffs.

00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.510
Even plucking their leaves
is a perilous task,

00:25:26.510 --> 00:25:29.040
let alone cutting branches
for propagation.

00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:32.680
Someone risked their life
to obtain the precious tea.

00:25:32.750 --> 00:25:33.440
I thought

00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:36.310
it would be too wasteful
to throw them away.

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:38.240
So I brought them here to have a try.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:43.360
Lord Lu has come to visit.

00:25:43.590 --> 00:25:45.190
Why didn't anyone inform me?

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.790
It seems that someone, seeing

00:25:47.790 --> 00:25:49.480
I've lost Grandmother's favor,

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.740
now thinks they can dismiss me entirely.

00:25:52.400 --> 00:25:53.640
So many have fallen to their deaths

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:55.550
picking tea leaves on those cliffs.

00:25:55.550 --> 00:25:57.280
He really does have great luck.

00:25:58.010 --> 00:25:58.810
Lady Shanbao.

00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:00.680
He has been waiting for you outside

00:26:00.680 --> 00:26:01.940
for two hours already.

00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.920
Lady Shanbao, you've always been true
to your word and deed.

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:06.590
When have you ever

00:26:06.590 --> 00:26:07.850
gone back on your word?

00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:10.720
You promised to meet him.

00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:12.870
How can you break your promise?

00:26:13.900 --> 00:26:15.340
Go to meet him.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.070
What a pity.

00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:28.860
He personally said he had a way

00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:29.960
to bring the precious cliff tea

00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.290
down from the mountain.

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:33.250
Since you refuse to see him,

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.680
this tea tree will

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:35.990
-have to stay...
-Mr. Yan.

00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:36.640
Thank you.

00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.240
Young Master, you're too silly.

00:26:49.240 --> 00:26:50.160
You got your hands all muddy,

00:26:50.160 --> 00:26:52.820
doing all this work
for someone else's benefit.

00:26:54.480 --> 00:26:55.680
What's easily gained

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.840
is never rare or special.

00:26:59.030 --> 00:27:01.490
Only what everyone yearns for
but can't have

00:27:01.590 --> 00:27:02.790
is truly precious.

00:27:04.590 --> 00:27:05.850
Let's get back to work.

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:11.890
My Lord, I have urgent news to report.

00:27:19.020 --> 00:27:20.710
[Rong Mansion]

00:27:23.350 --> 00:27:25.150
Go up the mountain immediately.

00:27:43.030 --> 00:27:45.470
Has he already left?

00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:49.150
Lady Shanbao.

00:27:49.310 --> 00:27:50.710
Mr. Lu asked me to tell you

00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.770
something terrible had happened
at Jijian Nunnery.

00:27:51.770 --> 00:27:54.190
Hurry up and go up the mountain
to check it out.

00:27:54.190 --> 00:27:55.110
Prepare a horse.

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:55.510
Yes.

00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:57.400
Where are you going?

00:28:11.110 --> 00:28:12.240
Come inside with me.

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:36.440
Remove the body.

00:28:43.880 --> 00:28:44.610
You're here.

00:28:58.030 --> 00:28:58.890
What happened?

00:28:59.150 --> 00:29:00.960
When the nuns gathered
for evening prayers,

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.070
they noticed she was nowhere to be seen.

00:29:03.070 --> 00:29:05.200
Later they found out
something bad had happened.

00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:06.440
The coroner has examined the body.

00:29:06.440 --> 00:29:08.370
There were no wounds on her body

00:29:09.030 --> 00:29:10.490
and no signs of poisoning.

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:13.080
It has been confirmed she hanged herself.

00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.160
Madam Yang made an excuse
to send Lady Yunwan away.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:37.350
Then she hanged herself alone in her room.

00:29:37.350 --> 00:29:38.520
When Lady Yunwan arrived here,

00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:41.320
the nuns
had already taken down Madam Yang's body.

00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:43.750
I was afraid Lady Yunwan
would make a scene and cause disruption,

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:44.880
so I ordered someone

00:29:45.010 --> 00:29:46.590
to forcibly take her away to have a rest.

00:29:46.590 --> 00:29:48.920
What she had desperately tried to protect

00:29:49.310 --> 00:29:50.780
was ultimately lost.

00:29:54.110 --> 00:29:55.310
If she finds this out,

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:59.080
I can't imagine how heartbroken she'll be.

00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:07.440
Take everyone from the nunnery

00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.170
back to the Government Office!

00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.660
I'll question them one by one.

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:16.310
Grandmother, Yunwan is a member
of the Rong family.

00:30:16.310 --> 00:30:17.880
She shouldn't stay
on the mountain for long.

00:30:17.880 --> 00:30:19.080
Grandmother, please

00:30:19.510 --> 00:30:21.240
allow me to bring her back soon.

00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:24.580
You know whether you're going
to Jijian Nunnery

00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:27.210
because of Wanwan

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:29.920
or out of concern for Madam Yang's safety.

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:31.720
I only have one question for you.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.860
I've told you
to reflect on your mistake these days.

00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:37.200
Do you realize where you went wrong?

00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.510
Grandmother, I have taken

00:30:38.510 --> 00:30:39.920
your words to heart.

00:30:40.550 --> 00:30:41.440
From now on, for everything I do,

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:43.200
I will first seek your instruction.

00:30:43.200 --> 00:30:44.460
I'll never act on my own

00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:45.880
or do things recklessly.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:48.830
It's good
that you've realized your mistake.

00:30:48.830 --> 00:30:50.630
Since Madam Yang has taken vows,

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:53.070
she has cut all ties with the mortal world

00:30:53.070 --> 00:30:54.820
and is no longer your godmother.

00:30:54.820 --> 00:30:55.820
As for Wanwan,

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:59.280
our Rong family
has already held a funeral for her.

00:31:00.110 --> 00:31:01.270
Everyone knows

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:04.830
that Lady Yunwan of the Rong family
is dead.

00:31:04.830 --> 00:31:06.030
It's better this way.

00:31:06.350 --> 00:31:06.960
Such

00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.270
a foolish child

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:10.680
should never have been born
into the Rong family.

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:11.880
She herself suffered

00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:14.590
and also disgraced the whole family.

00:31:14.590 --> 00:31:15.590
All these years,

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:16.830
as her elder sister,

00:31:16.830 --> 00:31:18.400
you have spent so much effort

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.200
and endured so much ridicule for her.

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:21.200
Outsiders might even think

00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:23.400
that our Rong family
must have committed terrible sins

00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:24.590
to have raised

00:31:24.590 --> 00:31:26.480
such an ignorant and shameful child.

00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:28.740
I think there's no need to bring her back.

00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:31.240
Let her remain on the mountain
to recuperate in peace.

00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.590
I will send someone else

00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:34.590
to deliver all her daily necessities.

00:31:34.590 --> 00:31:36.830
You'd better act
as if you never had this sibling.

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:39.110
Focus all your attention
on the matters of the tea plantations.

00:31:39.110 --> 00:31:39.910
Grandmother.

00:31:40.750 --> 00:31:42.720
Yunwan is a daughter of the Rong family,

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.350
my own blood sister.

00:31:45.070 --> 00:31:45.880
How could I bear to leave her

00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:47.880
stranded for good
in that lonely nunnery on the mountain

00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:49.320
and never allow her
to return the Rong Mansion?

00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:51.850
You claim
that you've realized your mistake!

00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:53.590
But I see you're clearly incorrigible.

00:31:53.590 --> 00:31:54.400
Grandmother.

00:31:54.400 --> 00:31:55.350
Shut up!

00:32:02.030 --> 00:32:03.030
I was reckless.

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:05.480
Grandmother, please calm down.

00:32:06.210 --> 00:32:07.180
But Wanwan...

00:32:07.210 --> 00:32:08.070
Old Madam Rong.

00:32:11.030 --> 00:32:13.030
Old Madam Rong,
there's a message from the mountain.

00:32:13.030 --> 00:32:13.590
It says

00:32:13.850 --> 00:32:16.050
Madam Yang has hanged herself and died.

00:32:21.890 --> 00:32:24.890
No. That can't be true.

00:32:25.440 --> 00:32:26.440
How pitiful.

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:30.410
She had clung to a wretched life
for ten years,

00:32:30.440 --> 00:32:31.660
but in the end, she still couldn't escape

00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:32.990
her destined calamity.

00:32:33.590 --> 00:32:35.510
This shows
every person has their own destiny.

00:32:35.510 --> 00:32:37.240
Now matter how capable you are,

00:32:37.510 --> 00:32:39.170
you still can't stop destiny.

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:40.720
For her,

00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:43.710
it was actually an end to her suffering.

00:32:45.270 --> 00:32:47.000
If you feel compassion for her,

00:32:47.070 --> 00:32:48.270
then spend more money

00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.480
and give her a proper burial.

00:32:51.350 --> 00:32:54.790
Grandmother, Yunwan
has just suffered this sudden misfortune.

00:32:54.790 --> 00:32:56.320
She must be very terrified.

00:32:56.750 --> 00:32:58.310
Grandmother, I beg you to allow me

00:32:58.310 --> 00:32:59.830
to go up the mountain immediately

00:32:59.830 --> 00:33:00.890
and bring her back.

00:33:01.350 --> 00:33:03.400
I've told you
that you're not allowed to go!

00:33:03.400 --> 00:33:04.400
Stop right there!

00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:06.440
Rong Shanbao.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:09.620
Have you forgotten the rules
of the Rong family?

00:33:14.270 --> 00:33:15.070
Grandmother.

00:33:16.170 --> 00:33:19.030
Our Rong ancestors belonged
to a matrilineal clan.

00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.160
We honor women,

00:33:21.590 --> 00:33:23.190
and we never look down on men.

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:25.920
The men of the clan hunted and fought,

00:33:25.920 --> 00:33:27.720
while the women took care of their homes.

00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:29.250
Together, they built a land

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:30.730
of peace and tranquility.

00:33:31.350 --> 00:33:33.070
That land was once vast.

00:33:34.030 --> 00:33:34.550
It was so vast that it could

00:33:34.550 --> 00:33:36.080
shelter countless people.

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:39.240
When destitute strangers arrived,

00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.270
they could get clean food,

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:42.960
warm clothes,

00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:44.930
and even a piece of land.

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:46.510
From then on,

00:33:47.590 --> 00:33:48.240
they became

00:33:48.240 --> 00:33:49.480
members of our clan.

00:33:52.390 --> 00:33:53.990
These heartwarming stories

00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:56.070
were all told to me by you.

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.240
It was you

00:33:58.650 --> 00:34:00.510
who made our ancestors my ideals.

00:34:01.350 --> 00:34:02.950
You always talk about rules,

00:34:03.590 --> 00:34:05.350
but the laws of the jungle

00:34:06.110 --> 00:34:08.030
and those self-serving doctrines

00:34:08.030 --> 00:34:09.710
have never been our rules.

00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:11.280
By our rules,

00:34:11.989 --> 00:34:14.000
we would never cast aside frail elders

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.260
or disabled children,

00:34:15.710 --> 00:34:16.280
would never disdain

00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:18.030
a sister who is mentally challenged,

00:34:18.030 --> 00:34:18.760
would never turn away

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:19.670
a granddaughter who has traveled so far

00:34:19.670 --> 00:34:20.670
to find her roots,

00:34:21.190 --> 00:34:21.920
and would never, knowing

00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:23.150
a woman is innocent,

00:34:23.920 --> 00:34:25.480
stand idly by and watch her

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:28.070
suffer injustice and be driven to despair.

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.070
Never.

00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:31.010
You!

00:34:32.989 --> 00:34:34.590
How dare you accuse me,

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:38.110
your own grandmother!

00:34:40.670 --> 00:34:41.280
Shanbao,

00:34:41.630 --> 00:34:43.400
how can you speak to Grandmother
like this?

00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.130
Apologize to Grandmother now.

00:34:45.389 --> 00:34:47.790
Hurry!
Don't you see you're driving me mad?

00:34:51.820 --> 00:34:52.620
Grandmother,

00:34:53.980 --> 00:34:55.020
I was wrong.

00:34:57.110 --> 00:34:58.070
My mistake was

00:34:59.110 --> 00:35:01.040
being blindly obedient and filial

00:35:01.580 --> 00:35:03.380
and not speaking my mind sooner.

00:35:06.230 --> 00:35:08.160
You scolded my father and my uncles

00:35:08.260 --> 00:35:10.000
for abandoning their families,

00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:11.060
chasing after fame

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:13.800
and leaving the tea plantations behind.

00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:14.800
But you yourself,

00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:16.280
over these years,

00:35:17.590 --> 00:35:18.880
have also strayed

00:35:19.760 --> 00:35:20.550
too far.

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:22.800
You value power

00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.280
and prestige

00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.550
more than your own family.

00:35:27.510 --> 00:35:28.230
You value them

00:35:28.230 --> 00:35:30.720
more than your granddaughters
bound to you by blood.

00:35:30.720 --> 00:35:32.840
It has been so long

00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:34.920
since you told us

00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:37.030
about the sacred mountains
in our homeland,

00:35:37.030 --> 00:35:38.230
the ancient palaces,

00:35:38.760 --> 00:35:39.630
and that queen

00:35:39.940 --> 00:35:41.940
who would sit under the cypress tree

00:35:42.330 --> 00:35:43.070
teaching children

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:44.400
how to make tea bricks.

00:35:56.590 --> 00:35:57.720
Where are you going?

00:35:58.550 --> 00:35:59.280
I'm going to gather the remains

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.920
of a poor woman

00:36:01.670 --> 00:36:03.070
and bring my sister home.

00:36:03.330 --> 00:36:05.070
How dare you defy Grandmother like this!

00:36:05.070 --> 00:36:06.370
It's utterly disrespectful!

00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:07.040
Shut up!

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:11.800
Rong Shanbao.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.330
If you go out now,

00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:15.480
you know

00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:16.480
what you'll lose.

00:36:17.090 --> 00:36:18.890
If you dare step out of that door,

00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:21.100
you'll never be allowed back!

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.440
I started the new tea plantations

00:36:35.440 --> 00:36:36.900
on Green Mountain myself.

00:36:37.150 --> 00:36:38.680
I'll live there from now on.

00:36:39.440 --> 00:36:40.070
But I will always be

00:36:40.070 --> 00:36:41.620
a daughter of the Rong family

00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:43.020
and your granddaughter.

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:46.110
Whenever the Rong family needs me

00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:48.330
or whenever you miss me,

00:36:48.630 --> 00:36:49.560
I will come back.

00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.150
Are you going to turn against me too?

00:36:57.440 --> 00:36:58.300
Old Madam Rong!

00:37:01.510 --> 00:37:02.370
Old Madam Rong!

00:37:02.550 --> 00:37:03.320
Grandmother!

00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.180
Old Madam Rong!

00:37:04.440 --> 00:37:05.300
Old Madam Rong!

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:07.380
Old Madam Rong!

00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:21.360
My Lord.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:23.280
Why isn't Madam Yang's name

00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:24.880
inscribed on her tombstone?

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:27.030
The Yang family accused her
of being unfilial and disrespectful.

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:29.030
Outsiders blamed her
for lacking wifely virtue

00:37:29.030 --> 00:37:30.690
and refusing to be compliant.

00:37:31.030 --> 00:37:32.880
They thought this brought the disaster

00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:34.480
to the Wei and Yang families.

00:37:35.110 --> 00:37:35.800
Shanbao fears

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.320
someone might deliberately damage
the grave

00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:39.920
and disturb the peace of the deceased.

00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:41.080
If the Wei family had not bullied
Madam Yang

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:42.210
and the Yang family had not brought
false charges,

00:37:42.210 --> 00:37:44.070
nothing bad would have occurred.

00:37:44.190 --> 00:37:46.120
Those people are truly shameless!

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:51.710
Shanbao.

00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:06.190
Shanbao.

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:08.260
When Grandmother learned

00:38:08.360 --> 00:38:09.710
that you personally brought the body back

00:38:09.710 --> 00:38:10.770
from the Government Office for burial,

00:38:10.770 --> 00:38:12.170
she was utterly enraged.

00:38:12.550 --> 00:38:13.440
Yunxi

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.280
and Xiangling pleaded on your behalf.

00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:17.670
They were both severely scolded
by Grandmother.

00:38:17.670 --> 00:38:18.670
Grandmother even forbade everyone
in the mansion

00:38:18.670 --> 00:38:20.530
from having any contact with you.

00:38:20.550 --> 00:38:22.010
Grandmother has also said

00:38:22.150 --> 00:38:24.080
that those tea plantations you own

00:38:24.370 --> 00:38:25.280
are not allowed to operate

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:26.960
under the Rong family's name.

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:28.840
Shanbao.

00:38:29.230 --> 00:38:30.150
You should come back with me

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:31.880
and apologize to Grandmother.

00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.840
Grandmother loves you
and values you deeply.

00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:35.840
She has spared no effort
in nurturing you all these years.

00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:37.840
If you're willing to go back
and apologize,

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:38.510
you'll still be

00:38:38.510 --> 00:38:40.370
the noble lady of the Rong family.

00:38:40.630 --> 00:38:42.190
You won't have to live out here
in the wilderness,

00:38:42.190 --> 00:38:43.590
exposed to the elements.

00:38:44.010 --> 00:38:46.550
We women of the Rong family
start our education at four.

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:48.120
The very first lesson we learn

00:38:48.120 --> 00:38:49.920
is that we don't follow the ruler

00:38:50.110 --> 00:38:50.920
or our elders,

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.110
but moral conscience

00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:54.440
and true justice.

00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.070
I've said everything
that needs to be said.

00:38:57.070 --> 00:38:58.840
It's not that I don't want to be filial.

00:38:58.840 --> 00:39:00.630
It's that Grandmother is angry with me

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:02.190
and won't let me go back home.

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:04.000
Yunshu, you're gentle and obedient,

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.320
devoting yourself wholeheartedly
to serving Grandmother.

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:09.760
In the days to come, please take care
of Grandmother in my place

00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.820
and bring comfort and joy to her side.

00:39:12.070 --> 00:39:14.330
Lady Shanbao, how could I compare to you?

00:39:14.630 --> 00:39:16.230
I am not the legitimate heir.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:17.770
And my mother was a maid.

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.710
I do not acknowledge distinctions of birth

00:39:19.710 --> 00:39:21.040
or social hierarchies.

00:39:22.030 --> 00:39:24.030
Your parents were a perfect couple.

00:39:24.440 --> 00:39:26.280
You are your father's only daughter

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.400
and my dear cousin.

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:29.030
However,

00:39:30.030 --> 00:39:32.190
Yunshu, you have chosen a difficult path.

00:39:32.190 --> 00:39:34.850
Please take good care of yourself
in the future.

00:39:36.150 --> 00:39:38.480
Shanbao, what are you talking about?

00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:40.710
I mean

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:44.320
it's getting dark
and the mountain path is dangerous.

00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:46.190
Yunshu, your eyesight isn't good,

00:39:46.190 --> 00:39:48.390
so you must be extra careful
with your steps.

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:50.720
You'd better head down the mountain soon.

00:39:56.190 --> 00:39:58.190
Thank you for your concern, Shanbao.

00:39:58.190 --> 00:39:59.450
I'll keep that in mind.

00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:02.580
Shanbao, please take good care
of yourself too.

Xiu Qiong.

00:40:50.070 --> 00:40:51.400
Just now, did you notice

00:40:52.190 --> 00:40:53.920
how Yunshu reacted when she saw

00:40:54.070 --> 00:40:54.930
that new grave?

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:57.070
Lady Yunshu is blind.

00:40:57.510 --> 00:40:59.440
What could she possibly have seen?

00:40:59.670 --> 00:41:00.670
But Lady Shanbao,

00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.710
who exactly was this Lin Pingxiang?

00:41:02.710 --> 00:41:03.510
Why did you come here specially

00:41:03.510 --> 00:41:05.280
to choose an auspicious burial site
for her

00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:06.630
and specifically instructed someone

00:41:06.630 --> 00:41:09.290
to plant February Orchids
in front of the grave?

00:41:31.960 --> 00:41:33.360
Don't worry, Godmother.

00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:34.800
From now on,

00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:38.320
I will definitely take good care
of Wanwan.

As for the one who has been

00:41:39.710 --> 00:41:41.910
stirring up trouble behind the scenes,

00:41:41.950 --> 00:41:44.010
I will never let them get away with it.

00:41:45.760 --> 00:41:46.560
Young Master.

00:41:46.710 --> 00:41:47.840
You've been waiting eagerly for so long.

00:41:47.840 --> 00:41:48.800
Are you really leaving
without even meeting

00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:49.590
Lady Shanbao?

00:41:49.590 --> 00:41:50.550
Her top priority right now

00:41:50.550 --> 00:41:51.950
is not personal romance.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:52.960
It's to bring the real culprit

00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:54.510
who killed Madam Yang to justice
as soon as possible.

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:55.710
By my duty and by my feelings,

00:41:55.710 --> 00:41:56.630
I can no longer let this person

00:41:56.630 --> 00:41:57.560
remain at large.

00:41:58.440 --> 00:41:59.840
Didn't she hang herself?

00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:01.710
How could there be a real culprit?

We already gave our answer yesterday.

After Venerable Huijing took her vows,

00:42:08.070 --> 00:42:09.530
she became a Buddhist nun.

Apart from Lady Rong Shanbao,

00:42:11.790 --> 00:42:13.360
she never received
any other outside visitors.

00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:15.190
Please think carefully again

00:42:15.710 --> 00:42:18.510
and see if there's anything
you might have missed.

00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:23.820
Venerable,

00:42:24.190 --> 00:42:25.590
did you notice anything?

Feel free to speak. It's all right.

00:42:30.590 --> 00:42:34.400
That day I forgot
about the evening prayers.

00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:37.700
I was afraid others would blame me,
so I dared not mention it.

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:40.090
I ran into a male visitor.

representing the Emperor
on inspection tours,

so Jiang Yiqian had to show you
some respect.

Now that you're merely a Prefect,

00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:20.940
you must be extremely careful
