00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.280
Japanese invaders run rampant

00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.920
violating our China.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.440
Japanese invaders run rampant

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.000
violating our China.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.520
The people of Sanzao

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.040
stand united as one.

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:07.400
The people of Sanzao

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.000
stand united as one.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.600
We carry out heaven's justice

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.280
with eternal loyalty and righteousness.

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.600
We carry out heaven's justice

00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.930
with eternal loyalty and righteousness.

00:02:39.320 --> 00:02:40.040
Sir,

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.520
it's time.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.860
Brother Erhu needs to depart now.

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:48.520
Don't worry, sir.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.440
I'm off.

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:35.880
What part of Macao is this?

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.600
This street represents the lowest level of Macao society.

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.000
Due to the recent years of war and chaos,

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.040
beggars and prostitutes are everywhere,

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:44.840
along with refugees from all regions.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:46.770
Please stay close to me, Director.

00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.410
Thank you for your trouble.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.560
Fa

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.320
Uncle Yi

00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:17.959
This is...

00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:23.480
Please wait.

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:41.480
Is the weather okay?

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.810
The weather is fine.

00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:44.520
As long as we're on our way

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.440
and don't run into Japanese patrol boats,

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:47.320
we'll be safe.

00:04:48.680 --> 00:04:49.409
Don't worry.

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:50.600
We're armed,

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:51.970
and besides,

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.840
Brother Geng gave us twenty extra bullets.

00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.440
In two or three hours,

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.580
we should be there.

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:02.660
The wind is too strong.

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:04.960
Xiaohu, start the engine.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:06.320
Let's speed up.

00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:06.920
Okay.

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.340
What an honored guest!

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:26.090
Please come in quickly.

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.360
Please.

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.460
Director Shen.

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.280
Mr. Ye,

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:34.560
I've long admired you.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.159
Director Shen.

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.080
In recent years, Anlantang

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.940
has had fewer dealings with government officials.

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.210
What a rare visitor!

00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:45.159
I should have visited you long ago.

00:05:45.159 --> 00:05:45.920
Come here!

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.000
For our first meeting,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.840
a small gift.

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:49.840
Please accept it.

00:05:58.440 --> 00:05:59.800
Wait for me outside.

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.290
As they say, don't accept rewards without merit.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:07.920
Director Shen, coming so late,

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:09.250
you must have business.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:12.520
I don't like beating around the bush.

00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.320
Just tell me what's on your mind.

00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:15.560
It's like this.

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:17.360
Recently,

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:18.640
you entrusted Wu Fa

00:06:18.640 --> 00:06:20.120
with information about Sanzao Island for us.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:21.120
We received it.

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:23.400
Mr. Dai insisted I express

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:24.760
his gratitude to you.

00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:28.440
No need to thank me.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:28.960
Come.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:29.890
Please sit down.

00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:32.640
The news from the island.

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:35.560
I'm just following my brother's orders

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.600
and doing as instructed.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.920
I've long known about the deep bond between you brothers.

00:06:43.400 --> 00:06:44.159
Admirable.

00:06:47.159 --> 00:06:48.760
Do you see that street ahead?

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.720
Huawangtang Street.

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.420
The infamous coolie trade street back then.

00:06:54.159 --> 00:06:55.880
There were over 300 establishments

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.409
selling Chinese laborers along that street.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.040
In Macau at that time,

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.720
there were tens of thousands of foreigners

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.560
engaged in human trafficking.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.200
They used all kinds of methods -

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.600
deception, kidnapping, whatever it took.

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:10.740
They forcibly sold and exported Chinese laborers.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.800
Some died at sea.

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:16.240
Some were lucky enough to reach America.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:17.320
As for me,

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.320
living was worse than death.

00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.840
If it weren't for my brother

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.280
who secured an official position from the court

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.760
and then went to Honolulu,

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.000
we wouldn't be where we are today.

00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:31.440
Mr. Ye, this is what they call

00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.880
surviving a calamity brings good fortune.

00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:35.960
Don't you have a niece

00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:37.560
named Ye Biying?

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.400
How do you know about her?

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:43.240
She works for us.

00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:47.140
Working for the Military Intelligence?

00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:51.850
Our family doesn't need money.

00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:54.480
She shouldn't be doing such dangerous work.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:55.440
Mr. Ye,

00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.680
you're mistaken.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.320
Miss Ye is serving her country

00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:02.000
in these difficult times.

00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:07.680
That year, my brother and I

00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:10.080
carried her in one arm

00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.960
and held Xia'er with the other hand

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.240
as we returned from Hawaii to the island.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.000
Recently,

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:18.880
I just sent her to Sanzao Island.

00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.280
She's now with her father,

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.000
Ye Degong.

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:28.240
I heard you have a mission

00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:31.240
to send someone tonight

00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:32.480
to bring them back.

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.730
How did you know about this?

00:08:36.080 --> 00:08:37.520
Is it tonight?

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:41.799
What are you trying to do?

00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:45.880
Let me be honest with you.

00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.410
The purpose of my visit to Macau

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:50.400
is to ask you

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.680
if you're confident

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:52.800
about this plan.

00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:55.440
Then I'll be honest with you too.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.280
For my family and my niece,

00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.320
I would do anything.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.680
Mr. Ye,

00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:02.520
you misunderstand.

00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:03.760
Like you,

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:06.080
I want them to evacuate safely.

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:08.840
Then why

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:10.170
are you questioning me?

00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:13.400
I just have three questions.

00:09:13.720 --> 00:09:14.400
First,

00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:16.200
for this operation,

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.840
do you have a detailed plan?

00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:18.980
Second,

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:20.960
before taking action,

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.520
have you conducted thorough reconnaissance?

00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:24.240
Third, if the mission fails,

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.760
what's your backup plan?

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:29.490
We've done everything necessary.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:31.920
Director Shen,

00:09:31.920 --> 00:09:33.400
if you have any objections,

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:35.120
I'm afraid it's too late.

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.960
Because the people going to pick them up

00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:41.160
have already left.

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:45.440
And now

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.040
they should be meeting soon.

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:08.840
I'm here.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.320
Remember what I told you.

00:10:11.400 --> 00:10:12.600
Today is the last quarter moon.

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.800
After midnight,

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.800
the tide will rise 30 to 50 meters.

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.480
When that happens, release this

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.840
and push the car directly into the sea.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.970
Remember to wipe away the tire tracks.

00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:27.200
Tomorrow morning, the Japanese will organize people

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.060
to search for us in large numbers.

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:30.240
By then, we can

00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.440
gain an extra day

00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.400
to leave Macau.

00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:33.680
Then we'll be safe.

00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:35.760
Don't touch anything in the car.

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.960
Push everything into the sea together.

00:10:38.400 --> 00:10:39.800
When you get home tomorrow,

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.040
if they come asking questions,

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:42.040
remember this:

00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:42.720
say that yesterday afternoon,

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.000
we left home together

00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:45.290
and never came back.

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:46.840
Okay.

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.320
The Major should be here soon.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.080
Let's go.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.760
Mr. Ye.

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:59.560
I know you have another way

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.760
to contact Sanzao Island.

00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:03.320
Could you notify them right now

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.520
to abort the mission?

00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:06.080
You must be mistaken.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.440
I have no way

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.560
to contact the island.

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:11.720
Then we can only leave it to fate.

00:11:14.920 --> 00:11:16.080
May I stay with you

00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:17.560
while we await the news?

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:44.800
He's here.

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:48.320
Major.

00:11:48.840 --> 00:11:50.700
How's your wound? Can you hold on?

00:11:51.400 --> 00:11:52.480
Why is he here?

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:54.040
He agreed to help us.

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.560
Mr. Wumu.

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.760
I know this decision was difficult for you.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.740
Thank you very much for your assistance.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.100
Let's not talk about this now.

00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.240
We'll discuss everything after we get out safely.

00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:19.720
Find a place to hide first.

00:12:19.720 --> 00:12:21.120
It's too dangerous here.

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:22.720
Longxia,

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:23.680
go keep watch over there.

00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:25.340
Tell us when the boat arrives.

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:29.760
Wait in the back for a moment.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:32.740
This is our Sanzao Island.

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:36.720
This is Macau.

00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.880
This island is called Dahengqin Island.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:44.880
It's our necessary route to Macau.

00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:45.640
This is also the territory

00:12:45.640 --> 00:12:47.480
of the Navy's Sixth Air Base.

00:12:47.760 --> 00:12:50.000
There are two naval battalions on this island

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.730
and one naval garrison regiment stationed here.

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:56.450
Is someone meeting us in Macau?

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:59.400
There's a Nationalist Government Military Intelligence contact point in Macau.

00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:00.920
I've already sent them a message,

00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:03.160
but I haven't received their reply.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.860
Although Macau is a neutral zone,

00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:08.440
there are likely

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:10.320
many Japanese intelligence agencies there.

00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:11.200
No matter what,

00:13:11.200 --> 00:13:13.130
the situation is better than here.

00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:14.840
After we arrive in Macau,

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:16.640
we need to find Anlan Hall first.

00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.120
It will be much safer there.

00:13:18.120 --> 00:13:18.720
Then we need to

00:13:18.720 --> 00:13:20.400
contact the Nationalist Government as soon as possible,

00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:21.720
hand you over to them,

00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:23.160
and my mission will be complete.

00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.440
That would be best.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:25.520
I feel that

00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.240
being discovered by the Japanese here

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.720
is just a matter of time.

00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.650
There's another situation

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.960
I must warn both of you about.

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:38.200
If we

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:40.000
encounter any danger at sea,

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:42.440
whoever survives among us

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:43.960
needs to either deliver this intelligence

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:45.480
or destroy it.

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:48.640
So, Major,

00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.400
I still hope you can

00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:51.720
honestly tell us

00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.420
what this intelligence is actually for.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:58.520
All I can tell you is

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:01.960
if I die,

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:05.490
many people won't find their way home.

00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:11.880
So,

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:13.880
this intelligence

00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:16.120
really is related to America's retaliation

00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.250
after Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor?

00:14:21.880 --> 00:14:22.680
Xiaohu,

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:23.800
turn off the engine

00:14:23.800 --> 00:14:25.060
and come here quickly.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.240
What's wrong?

00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:36.600
We're not far from Sanzao now.

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.930
Let's row the boat over.

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:38.800
Hurry.

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:55.040
I can see Sanzao.

00:14:57.880 --> 00:14:58.840
That's right.

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.080
It's Sanzao.

00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.280
Xiaohu.

00:15:01.520 --> 00:15:02.440
Give me the flashlight quickly.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:03.280
Okay.

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.280
It's them.

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:28.640
Quick, Xiaohu.

00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:29.640
Row faster.

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:31.770
They're coming.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:37.360
We can just avoid them.

00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:38.720
Japanese patrol boat.

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:39.520
They're gone.

00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:49.240
Dahu.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:50.640
Young Master.

00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:04.600
Young Master.

00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.560
Dahu, why are there Japanese here?

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.000
Don't worry.

00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.130
They're on our side.

00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:09.520
This is Wumu.

00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:10.960
This is Major Weite.

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:12.920
Dahu and Xiaohu are both our people.

00:16:12.920 --> 00:16:14.180
Young Master, Miss Ye.

00:16:14.480 --> 00:16:16.720
Their families were all killed by the Japanese.

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:18.360
Now they work for my uncle.

00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:20.800
Uncle Geng asked us to come quickly.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:23.680
Probably something happened to Uncle Ye.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:25.600
It's fine.

00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:26.680
Did you encounter

00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:28.040
any Japanese patrol boats at sea?

00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:28.800
No.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:30.240
How long does it take from Macau to here?

00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:31.600
About three hours.

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:32.840
Dahu.

00:16:32.840 --> 00:16:34.040
This matter is very important.

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:35.120
You must safely

00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:36.320
take them to my uncle.

00:16:37.280 --> 00:16:37.640
Understood.

00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:38.440
Young Master.

00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:39.120
Let's go then.

00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:40.440
We shouldn't stay here long.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.080
Let's go.

00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.360
Please take care of my father.

00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.090
Don't worry.

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:48.800
Young Master.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:49.720
Aren't you coming?

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:50.360
I'm not leaving.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.220
I need to stay here with my father.

00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:55.600
Then, Young Master,

00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:56.730
I have a favor to ask.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.960
Qingming Festival is coming soon.

00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:00.160
On that day,

00:17:00.360 --> 00:17:01.360
please go to the mountain

00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:03.080
and burn some paper money for our parents.

00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:03.800
Tell them

00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.160
Xiaohu and I are at Uncle Geng's place

00:17:05.160 --> 00:17:05.839
and doing well.

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:06.520
Don't worry.

00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:07.650
I'll take care of it.

00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.119
Thank you, Young Master.

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:09.960
Take care.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.200
Take care.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:12.040
Let's go.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.640
Where have you been all these years?

00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:14.700
Have you been well?

00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:16.840
It's a long story.

00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.320
I'll tell you later.

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:20.050
How is everyone at home?

00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:21.000
All good.

00:18:21.280 --> 00:18:22.000
What about Uncle Ye?

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.160
How is his health?

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.600
Do you hear an engine sound?

00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:49.360
Miss.

00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:51.160
It's a Japanese patrol boat.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:53.840
It seems to be coming from that direction.

00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:54.720
Patrol boat?

00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:56.640
Didn't you say they only come once every half hour?

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:57.480
Xiaohu.

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.920
Turn the boat around and start the engine.

00:18:58.920 --> 00:18:59.720
No.

00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:00.930
There's no time.

00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:02.000
It's too risky.

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:03.280
They'll catch up with us soon.

00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:04.360
None of us will escape.

00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:05.360
What should we do?

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:12.640
Abandon ship.

00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:13.640
Get in the water.

00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:24.920
What are you doing?

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.000
Miss,

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:26.880
we can't leave.

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:27.960
If we all leave,

00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:28.560
when the enemy arrives,

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.200
they'll definitely search underwater.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.520
If we leave, we leave together.

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:32.240
Miss,

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:33.320
you go first.

00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.120
Hurry and go.

00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:35.320
Don't worry about us.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:54.920
Someone's over there.

00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:45.320
Xiaohu.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:45.800
You go too.

00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:47.060
Brother, you go first.

00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:50.760
Go!

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:52.040
Brother, go now!

00:20:52.520 --> 00:20:53.280
Hurry!

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.080
What happened?

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.040
What's going on?

00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:03.760
The patrol boat came early.

00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:04.960
The car wasn't pushed in, was it?

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:05.680
Not yet.

00:23:06.320 --> 00:23:07.520
We need to leave quickly.

00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.480
The police squad will soon

00:23:08.480 --> 00:23:09.810
block off this sea area.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:11.740
Where are Dahu and Xiaohu?

00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.720
They could have left the boat,

00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:14.760
but they didn't.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:15.440
It was for us,

00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:16.840
to buy us more time.

00:23:20.320 --> 00:23:21.580
If you don't leave now,

00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.520
their sacrifice will be in vain.

00:23:24.080 --> 00:23:24.760
Go!

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:35.960
Put him down first.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.280
Major.

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:44.800
His breathing is rapid.

00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:45.920
He might have broken ribs

00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.880
that punctured his organs causing internal bleeding.

00:23:47.880 --> 00:23:48.680
We need to find a place immediately

00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.080
to examine him properly.

00:23:51.280 --> 00:23:52.410
Get in the car first.

00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:22.680
Patrol boat unit reporting.

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:24.240
Yes.

00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:26.120
We intercepted a small boat

00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:28.640
smuggling people in Jinwan waters.

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.280
Two people were killed.

00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:31.680
The patrol boat unit requests

00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.210
that you send someone over.

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.680
Be more specific.

00:24:36.960 --> 00:24:38.640
Was it one of our island's fishing boats

00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.120
trying to smuggle out?

00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:41.760
No.

00:24:42.240 --> 00:24:44.360
The patrol boat crew says

00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:46.520
it appears to be a boat from Macau.

00:24:46.520 --> 00:24:48.520
It had already infiltrated the base

00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.160
and was discovered while leaving.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:53.760
There was also a small firefight.

00:24:53.880 --> 00:24:55.810
Understood. We'll be right there.

00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:04.480
Report.

00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:06.240
Notify Lieutenant Sasaki

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:06.960
to come with me

00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.890
to the naval patrol boat unit dock.

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:23.440
Inoue.

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:23.760
Yes.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:24.600
Take men immediately and seal off

00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:25.840
the Jinwan area coastline.

00:25:25.840 --> 00:25:26.320
Sasaki.

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.200
Have your team follow me.

00:25:28.200 --> 00:25:29.320
Move out.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.480
Yes.

00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.160
Come.

00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.360
Over here.

00:26:30.720 --> 00:26:31.640
Where is the secret room?

00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.520
It's here.

00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.040
Right here.

00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:50.800
Go bring the Major and Biying in.

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:51.520
Okay.

00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.120
Be careful.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:12.810
Take it slow.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.320
Lift the table up.

00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:26.560
Let me do it.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:27.560
Put him on it.

00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.200
Move down a bit.

00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:38.530
One, two, three.

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:48.000
Bear with it.

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.080
His ribs were already fractured.

00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:52.760
This movement

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:54.400
has caused him tremendous pain.

00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:56.530
Chest pain causes shallow breathing.

00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:58.800
Once secretions build up in the airways,

00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:00.200
it can lead to lung infection

00:28:00.200 --> 00:28:01.240
or atelectasis.

00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:02.760
So what do we do now?

00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:03.800
But my current assessment is

00:28:03.800 --> 00:28:04.640
what's more serious is

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.320
his ribs have already

00:28:05.320 --> 00:28:06.600
punctured his pleura,

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.040
causing intercostal bleeding

00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:09.320
resulting in hemothorax and pneumothorax.

00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:10.440
So I'm asking, what do we do now?

00:28:10.440 --> 00:28:12.170
I need to operate immediately.

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:20.780
This is all I have in my car now.

00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:26.760
It has everything we need.

00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.020
Do you have any tubing?

00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:29.560
I need a tube.

00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:32.680
Will this work?

00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:34.450
Sterilize it with fire.

00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.280
I'm making the incision now.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:45.560
Hold on.

00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:47.680
The tube.

00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:49.920
Help me find

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:50.560
a basin.

00:28:53.440 --> 00:28:53.840
Hold him down.

00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:54.900
Don't let him move.

00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:55.980
Keep him still.

00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:57.400
Just put it below.

00:28:58.960 --> 00:28:59.720
Bear with it.

00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:00.480
Weite.

00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:01.200
Hang in there.

00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:01.960
Stay strong.

00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:13.920
Vito.

00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:15.080
Vito.

00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:16.800
He passed out.

00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:29.200
What do we do now?

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:31.000
Wait a moment.

00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:35.960
Vito.

00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:38.040
Vito.

00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:40.770
That's about it.

00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:44.980
I need to stitch him up.

00:29:53.080 --> 00:29:54.340
Hold the light steady.

00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:55.080
Come here.

00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:56.140
Shine it over here.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:18.080
Do you have scissors?

00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:25.520
Cut it here.

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.000
Wait.

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.040
Is it over?

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:44.640
It's over.

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:45.640
We need to leave quickly.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.900
Oshima Hiroshi could arrive any moment.

00:30:48.120 --> 00:30:48.720
Longxia,

00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:50.720
you're in charge of cleaning up here.

00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.760
I'm leaving this to you.

00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:52.160
Okay.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:53.930
The flashlight,

00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.050
take it with you.

00:30:58.240 --> 00:30:59.080
Let's go.

00:30:59.640 --> 00:30:59.880
Let's go.

00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:00.360
Be careful.

00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:00.920
Okay.

00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:32.080
Captain,

00:31:32.760 --> 00:31:34.690
these two aren't from the village.

00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.840
They must be from Macau.

00:31:53.040 --> 00:31:54.520
Search them carefully.

00:32:02.680 --> 00:32:04.200
There's nothing

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.920
to identify them.

00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.480
Why do you think

00:32:11.480 --> 00:32:13.340
they risked coming to the island?

00:32:14.400 --> 00:32:16.240
They used to come frequently years ago,

00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.370
but haven't been here in recent years.

00:32:18.440 --> 00:32:20.720
They might come back again in the future.

00:32:21.200 --> 00:32:22.200
Also,

00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:24.960
the sentry who disappeared from the garrison a few days ago,

00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.240
could these two be connected to that?

00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.730
Do you think they have accomplices on the island?

00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.240
These troublemakers are unpredictable,

00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.200
their connections with Macau are complicated.

00:32:38.920 --> 00:32:40.320
Were they targeting this island specifically

00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:41.320
or

00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:43.360
just passing through?

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.080
That's still unclear at this point.

00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.080
At dawn, hang their bodies

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:54.200
at the entrance of Tanjiawan village,

00:32:54.200 --> 00:32:55.960
on the tree in front of the ancestral hall.

00:32:55.960 --> 00:32:58.090
Let them see what happens to these two.

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:01.440
That American who landed on the island

00:33:01.440 --> 00:33:02.840
still hasn't been found.

00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:04.360
We only suspect

00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.840
he's being hidden somewhere around Caotang Mountain.

00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:07.440
Could these two coming to the island

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:08.800
be related to that incident?

00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:10.480
There are some coincidences,

00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.120
but it's hard to say for sure.

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.840
What about the Colonel's woman?

00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.120
What is she doing now,

00:33:18.800 --> 00:33:19.760
do you know?

00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.720
Please relay my message to Captain Oshima Hiroshi.

00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:32.520
Yes, sir.

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:35.680
Report, sir.

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:39.520
Captain,

00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.440
Ye Biying and Major Wumu

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.700
have returned to the barracks together.

00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:44.200
You may go.

00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:50.000
What were they doing out so late?

00:33:50.760 --> 00:33:52.690
Probably doing things they enjoy.

00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:55.040
I suppose so.

00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:57.600
They

00:33:58.440 --> 00:34:01.120
really had a romantic time at the beach today.

00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.000
Yes.

00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:10.840
We need to investigate those two.

00:34:12.679 --> 00:34:13.639
Sasaki,

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:15.300
send someone to check on them.

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:18.480
No,

00:34:19.639 --> 00:34:20.600
I'll go myself.

00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:47.920
Today's incident

00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:49.179
was really dangerous.

00:34:50.120 --> 00:34:51.780
Let's not talk about this now.

00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:00.240
I'm really sorry.

00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:01.080
I don't know how

00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:02.680
things turned out like this.

00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:08.400
They're here so soon.

00:35:17.120 --> 00:35:18.040
Captain.

00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.560
The Colonel and that woman just returned.

00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:24.000
But it was too dark in the car.

00:35:24.000 --> 00:35:25.480
I couldn't see clearly.

00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:28.600
Dismissed.

00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:33.920
Everyone to your positions.

00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:44.840
Sasaki,

00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:45.970
go knock on the door.

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:15.760
Who is it?

00:36:16.360 --> 00:36:18.240
I'm Sasaki from the police unit.

00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:21.640
What brings you here so late?

00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:24.360
There's an emergency.

00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.280
Colonel.

00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:33.800
What kind of emergency

00:36:33.800 --> 00:36:35.400
that can't wait until morning?

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.400
According to the coastal patrol unit,

00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:37.560
assassins have been spotted infiltrating by sea.

00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:39.480
Captain Oshima is concerned about your safety

00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:42.740
and wants me to assign two more guards for your protection.

00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:44.240
Just a moment.

00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:47.640
Colonel.

00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:50.220
I'm very sorry to disturb you so late.

00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.520
Someone has landed on the island from Macau.

00:36:52.520 --> 00:36:55.400
We're searching this area now.

00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:57.920
Close the door.

00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.720
Talk outside.

00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:01.920
Excuse me.

00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:25.880
I don't really understand women.

00:37:29.320 --> 00:37:30.800
How's your wife doing?

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:37.760
She's fine.

00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.520
I really envy you.

00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:43.800
And your daughter?

00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:50.520
What are those two doing?

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:09.360
Good thing I never got married.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.880
What kind of assassins

00:38:25.880 --> 00:38:27.940
could make even the barracks unsafe?

00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:29.480
Several years ago,

00:38:29.480 --> 00:38:30.280
a major at our base

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.560
was killed by an assassin's bullet.

00:38:31.560 --> 00:38:33.440
If something happens to you at the base,

00:38:33.440 --> 00:38:34.240
we wouldn't be able

00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:35.970
to explain it to headquarters.

00:38:36.880 --> 00:38:37.520
Fine.

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:39.370
I appreciate your concern.

00:38:39.800 --> 00:38:41.040
But one or two assassins,

00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:42.440
I can handle them myself.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:45.440
But Colonel...

00:38:46.560 --> 00:38:48.560
Didn't your men report to you today?

00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:50.560
Miss Ye and I had an argument at the beach.

00:38:50.560 --> 00:38:51.840
She lost her temper with me.

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.400
I just managed to calm her down.

00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:54.800
Then you all showed up.

00:38:57.640 --> 00:38:59.200
Should I call Commander Fujita

00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.000
on the phone?

00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:00.720
Tell him

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:02.640
you've been watching my girlfriend,

00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:03.320
or rather,

00:39:03.320 --> 00:39:05.380
that I was your real target all along?

00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:06.880
No, no.

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:08.000
Just routine procedure.

00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:09.200
I truly apologize.

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:11.880
In a few days, please allow me to host a dinner for you

00:39:11.880 --> 00:39:13.280
to express my apologies.

00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:15.960
It's fine.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:18.120
You've all been busy all night.

00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.280
Get some rest.

00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:20.920
Yes, sir.

00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:23.000
We'll take our leave.

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:42.480
They're all gone.

00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:45.560
Gone.

00:39:51.520 --> 00:39:52.520
It seems

00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:55.000
I can't leave tonight either,

00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:55.840
can I?

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:06.120
You sleep inside.

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.530
I'll sleep outside.

00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:38.640
Sir,

00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:40.760
have some tea.

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:02.440
Sir.

00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:11.800
Xia'er,

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:12.560
how is it?

00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:12.960
Something's wrong!

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:13.840
Something happened.

00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:14.600
What happened?

00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:16.260
We encountered a patrol boat.

00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.240
Where is your sister?

00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:18.920
She's fine.

00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:20.120
She's with Wumu now.

00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:22.580
Where's the Major?

00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:25.280
We moved the Major to the Reading Hall.

00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:26.610
He's slightly injured.

00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.720
Ying'er performed surgery on him.

00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:30.520
He was asleep when I ran back.

00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:32.360
He should be fine too.

00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:35.920
Thank goodness.

00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:38.320
The ones from Macau

00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:40.560
were the Tiger brothers.

00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:47.040
They...

00:41:49.760 --> 00:41:51.640
They're all dead.

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:01.920
How could this

00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:04.000
happen?

00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:06.760
How is this possible?

00:42:06.760 --> 00:42:08.360
Was our information leaked?

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:09.720
I don't know either.

00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:11.880
Their boat had just left

00:42:11.920 --> 00:42:13.600
when they encountered a Japanese patrol boat.

00:42:13.600 --> 00:42:16.120
Later I heard intense gunfire.

00:42:16.120 --> 00:42:17.840
Then Ying'er and Wumu

00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.720
swam back supporting the Major.

00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:22.480
But they couldn't escape.

00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:27.200
Your uncle must be worried sick.

00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.680
Hurry,

00:42:28.680 --> 00:42:29.960
send him a message.

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:32.920
