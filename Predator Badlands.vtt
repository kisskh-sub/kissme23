WEBVTT

00:07:38.759 --> 00:07:41.929
Even father fears it.

00:12:43.130 --> 00:12:45.933
COMPUTER, IN YAUTJA:

00:21:44.737 --> 00:21:45.938
Yautja!

00:21:48.307 --> 00:21:50.677
Yautja!

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:06.859
Is this-- Is this-- Is this--

00:22:06.959 --> 00:22:08.027
Is this better?

00:22:09.762 --> 00:22:11.498
Universal translation.

00:22:11.598 --> 00:22:14.133
You hear Yautja,
others hear their language...

00:22:15.768 --> 00:22:17.704
Oh, boy.

00:22:18.638 --> 00:22:20.172
This isn't great for you.

00:22:40.893 --> 00:22:43.262
It waits
for the needles to paralyze you.

00:22:44.296 --> 00:22:47.033
Then eats you
while you can't move.

00:22:54.173 --> 00:22:58.511
I could help you, but...
I need a hand.

00:23:07.720 --> 00:23:11.758
Yautja might hunt alone,
but they die alone too.

00:23:14.961 --> 00:23:17.229
Kalisk.

00:23:19.832 --> 00:23:22.569
You're hunting the Kalisk.

00:23:34.514 --> 00:23:36.248
Gotta run faster.

00:23:43.422 --> 00:23:45.191
It happens fast, huh?

00:23:46.959 --> 00:23:49.929
If you had a weapon,
you know, I could use it.

00:23:53.966 --> 00:23:56.168
Throw me that,
and I can get you the antidote.

00:23:58.705 --> 00:24:00.106
Now or never.

00:24:37.677 --> 00:24:39.812
Hi.

00:25:02.001 --> 00:25:04.270
Should be good as new.

00:25:09.441 --> 00:25:11.110
The venom makes them bloom.

00:25:11.210 --> 00:25:13.479
Also makes them
a handy antidote.

00:25:20.052 --> 00:25:21.688
How about a lift?

00:25:24.924 --> 00:25:26.759
Let's go.

00:25:30.597 --> 00:25:32.231
Excuse you, sir.

00:25:35.434 --> 00:25:37.469
I'm synthetic.
I was built and deployed

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:40.306
by the Weyland-Yutani
Corporation for research.

00:25:40.406 --> 00:25:42.942
Because their humans wouldn't
last a day on this planet.

00:25:43.042 --> 00:25:44.176
We found that--

00:25:50.917 --> 00:25:52.885
Look...

00:25:52.985 --> 00:25:56.155
Many Yautja have come
for the great Kalisk,

00:25:56.255 --> 00:25:58.625
and none have survived it...

00:25:58.725 --> 00:26:00.126
or Genna.

00:26:03.262 --> 00:26:05.164
I've seen the Kalisk.

00:26:05.698 --> 00:26:07.299
I survived it.

00:26:08.434 --> 00:26:11.203
Here's my proposal:
You take me along with you,

00:26:11.303 --> 00:26:13.806
and I'll guide you to its den.

00:26:13.906 --> 00:26:16.275
Once there, I get my legs,

00:26:16.375 --> 00:26:18.010
you get your trophy,

00:26:18.110 --> 00:26:21.247
and everyone's a winner. Deal?

00:26:27.053 --> 00:26:31.123
Oh, yeah. I've seen the Kalisk.

00:26:42.902 --> 00:26:44.336
Okay. Hmm.

00:26:47.807 --> 00:26:49.575
Good luck with your journey.

00:26:50.777 --> 00:26:54.814
I'm just gonna...
go on my journey.

00:26:56.883 --> 00:26:58.918
I'm sure
you'll figure something out.

00:27:05.758 --> 00:27:08.494
Hey.

00:27:09.762 --> 00:27:12.832
I've already shown you
that I can be useful to you.

00:27:18.738 --> 00:27:22.742
Yes. Yes, exactly, like a tool.

00:27:22.842 --> 00:27:25.344
The only way to survive Genna
is to work with it,

00:27:25.444 --> 00:27:27.179
and I know how.

00:27:27.279 --> 00:27:30.416
And with the right tool...

00:27:31.884 --> 00:27:33.720
...you could get the Kalisk.

00:27:34.520 --> 00:27:35.888
You could be the first.

00:27:41.227 --> 00:27:43.629
You may call me Thi-- Whoa!

00:27:44.731 --> 00:27:48.868
You seem smaller than the other
Yautja. How old are you?

00:27:50.169 --> 00:27:51.738
And what does the chewing?

00:27:51.838 --> 00:27:54.306
Your outside fangs
or your inside teeth?

00:27:55.975 --> 00:27:58.577
Oh. What should I call you?

00:28:04.550 --> 00:28:06.418
Whoa!

00:28:06.518 --> 00:28:09.321
I've never been thrown before.
What a... ...thrill!

00:28:09.421 --> 00:28:11.657
How fast were you going
when your ship crashed?

00:28:11.758 --> 00:28:15.094
Faster than sub-light speed?
We haven't cracked that yet.

00:28:15.194 --> 00:28:17.463
Also, that plasma sword
is interesting.

00:28:17.563 --> 00:28:18.965
Is it unique to your clan?

00:28:19.065 --> 00:28:20.366
And what may I call you?

00:28:21.433 --> 00:28:24.303
I call these imbre anguis.

00:28:36.182 --> 00:28:37.850
They just want a snack.

00:28:45.191 --> 00:28:48.294
You catch more flies with honey
than you do with vinegar.

00:28:52.031 --> 00:28:55.868
Predatory organisms are
my specific area of expertise.

00:28:55.968 --> 00:28:59.305
I've studied Yautja extensively.
It's an impressive culture.

00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:02.909
Here, ask me anything.
I bet I have the answer.

00:29:03.009 --> 00:29:04.443
Oh!

00:29:05.845 --> 00:29:07.246
Very funny.

00:29:07.346 --> 00:29:09.081
And you still haven't
told me your name.

00:29:35.174 --> 00:29:37.043
Okay, sure.

00:29:37.643 --> 00:29:41.814
Well, let's back up
and start at the beginning.

00:29:42.181 --> 00:29:45.251
Genna was formed
64 billion cycles ago,

00:29:45.351 --> 00:29:48.287
when a dying red dwarf star
in a neighboring system...

00:30:01.067 --> 00:30:03.102
It's so beautiful.

00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:06.238
After all the time
I've been stuck here,

00:30:06.338 --> 00:30:08.407
I never get tired of the view.

00:30:12.178 --> 00:30:15.781
Well, we arrived on Genna two
years ago, and we built a base.

00:30:15.882 --> 00:30:18.384
Then, I was in
the vulture's nest

00:30:18.484 --> 00:30:20.219
for the most exciting

00:30:20.319 --> 00:30:23.455
13 days, seven hours, 43 minutes

00:30:23.555 --> 00:30:25.424
and two seconds of my life.

00:30:27.093 --> 00:30:29.061
But I always knew
someone would come.

00:30:30.062 --> 00:30:32.398
I was just wrong about who.

00:30:39.005 --> 00:30:40.372
Tessa.

00:30:41.874 --> 00:30:45.411
Our crew is made up
entirely of synths.

00:30:45.511 --> 00:30:47.379
But Tessa and I are special.

00:30:47.980 --> 00:30:50.382
We have a higher sensitivity
than the others.

00:30:56.255 --> 00:30:58.424
Sensitivity is what allows us
to understand

00:30:58.524 --> 00:31:00.426
the creatures on this planet.

00:31:04.096 --> 00:31:06.332
We were created
to work in tandem.

00:31:07.133 --> 00:31:11.137
Me, cooped up in the lab,
Tessa out in the field.

00:31:11.237 --> 00:31:14.573
Until the wonderful day
Tessa let me come with her.

00:31:14.673 --> 00:31:16.909
We were exploring Genna.

00:31:18.277 --> 00:31:21.413
And then the Kalisk attacked us.

00:31:22.514 --> 00:31:25.985
Separated me... and us.

00:31:28.587 --> 00:31:31.623
The last sound
I remember hearing

00:31:31.723 --> 00:31:35.094
was Tessa calling out my name.

00:31:35.761 --> 00:31:37.429
Reaching for me.

00:31:39.231 --> 00:31:41.033
Then the Kalisk.

00:31:42.234 --> 00:31:43.936
I didn't know what to do.

00:31:55.114 --> 00:31:57.783
But I refuse
to believe she's dead.

00:32:33.485 --> 00:32:35.487
Thia, Thia, Thia, Thia.

00:32:36.522 --> 00:32:38.957
Thia, Thia, Thia...

00:32:39.725 --> 00:32:41.994
Tessa!

00:32:43.462 --> 00:32:45.831
Thia, Thia, Thia, Thia.

00:32:45.931 --> 00:32:47.333
Thia, Thia.

00:33:26.905 --> 00:33:28.874
Hello, Tessa.

00:33:28.974 --> 00:33:31.643
The Company is not pleased.

00:33:33.445 --> 00:33:36.848
Continued failure will result
in your decommission.

00:33:40.386 --> 00:33:42.221
Where's Thia?

00:33:45.524 --> 00:33:47.493
The Yautja has Thia.

00:34:00.972 --> 00:34:04.009
Two warriors.
Dek and Thia, on the hunt.

00:34:04.610 --> 00:34:06.078
Oh.

00:34:06.178 --> 00:34:07.846
Quick question.

00:34:07.946 --> 00:34:09.248
What should I be doing?

00:34:16.888 --> 00:34:19.458
Bone bison.
They're Kalisk food.

00:34:24.863 --> 00:34:28.234
So exciting.
Hunting with a Yautja.

00:34:28.334 --> 00:34:29.368
Tessa wouldn't believe it.

00:34:31.937 --> 00:34:33.205
Just a warning...

00:34:38.377 --> 00:34:39.378
Razor grass.

00:34:43.014 --> 00:34:45.851
It'll cut you to ribbons.
We'll just go around.

00:34:55.026 --> 00:34:57.329
We might not be alone
in this hunt.

00:35:07.606 --> 00:35:09.007
What an odd critter.

00:35:09.107 --> 00:35:11.143
I've never seen you before.

00:35:16.648 --> 00:35:18.617
Thia. Nice to meet you.

00:35:33.965 --> 00:35:35.501
Looks like your competition
is better--

00:35:53.319 --> 00:35:55.954
Careful up in these trees.
There are Luna bugs!

00:36:17.175 --> 00:36:18.510
Coming up behind you!

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:33.592
Stronger than it looks!

00:36:43.602 --> 00:36:46.472
Uh, Dek?

00:36:46.572 --> 00:36:49.074
Dek! Look!

00:37:34.520 --> 00:37:35.787
Not a Kalisk.

00:37:37.989 --> 00:37:40.091
This is a Luna bug!

00:37:48.099 --> 00:37:49.501
Have any other weapons?

00:38:46.458 --> 00:38:48.494
Why'd you stop?
Let's get out of here.

00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:43.509
That was the best hunt
I've ever been on.

00:40:43.609 --> 00:40:45.043
This is the dream team
right here.

00:40:45.143 --> 00:40:47.546
The Dynamic Three.
The Dynamic Trio.

00:40:47.646 --> 00:40:49.380
The Dynamic Tree-oh!

00:40:49.481 --> 00:40:51.583
Tree-oh! Remember when
we went down the tree?

00:40:51.683 --> 00:40:53.284
That monster's mouth,
I mean...

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:56.588
Didn't smell great,
didn't smell great. But...

00:40:58.256 --> 00:41:00.759
We got him. We got him.
And then we met you,

00:41:00.859 --> 00:41:03.495
our little sweet,
little, little thing.

00:41:03.595 --> 00:41:05.997
Thank you, seriously,
for that experience.

00:41:06.097 --> 00:41:08.700
Truly amazing. Thrilling.

00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:11.236
Truly thrilling.
What was your favorite part?

00:41:24.382 --> 00:41:25.551
Cool.

00:41:33.959 --> 00:41:38.063
Oh. No, thanks. I don't eat,
but that's very sweet.

00:41:43.434 --> 00:41:44.670
Good to know.

00:41:49.775 --> 00:41:51.743
Our little bud here
looks hungry.

00:42:04.489 --> 00:42:06.424
I think she's marking you.

00:42:06.792 --> 00:42:08.994
She wants you
to be a part of her clan.

00:42:11.062 --> 00:42:11.963
Maybe she's lost.

00:42:14.432 --> 00:42:18.169
What do you mean?
Don't all Yautja have family?

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:24.375
So you never had anyone
looking out for you?

00:42:30.281 --> 00:42:31.182
Had?

00:42:34.385 --> 00:42:35.754
What happened to him?

00:42:44.129 --> 00:42:45.563
You're grieving.

00:42:52.938 --> 00:42:55.373
You're here
because you lost your brother.

00:43:08.353 --> 00:43:10.055
I'm here
because traveling with you

00:43:10.155 --> 00:43:12.490
is the best way
to get back to Tessa.

00:43:14.425 --> 00:43:16.027
When I was
in that vulture's nest,

00:43:16.127 --> 00:43:18.797
I was so afraid
I would never see her again.

00:43:23.735 --> 00:43:26.004
I can survive on my own.

00:43:27.438 --> 00:43:29.875
But who would want
to survive on their own?

00:43:41.853 --> 00:43:43.288
Sister.

00:43:46.224 --> 00:43:47.325
Yeah.

00:43:48.059 --> 00:43:49.795
I guess she is.

00:43:51.562 --> 00:43:54.866
I have... a sister.

00:43:57.602 --> 00:43:59.637
What a lovely thought.

00:44:04.509 --> 00:44:06.044
I need to find her.

00:44:10.648 --> 00:44:12.083
Excuse me?

00:44:20.025 --> 00:44:21.559
Was that a joke?

00:47:43.895 --> 00:47:45.496
We can't leave Bud.

00:47:46.131 --> 00:47:47.432
Bud?

00:47:47.532 --> 00:47:50.635
Yeah, Bud. I named her.

00:47:55.106 --> 00:47:57.342
You're not alone, I'm with you.

00:48:06.517 --> 00:48:08.886
The tree would have eaten us
without her.

00:49:35.973 --> 00:49:37.575
Bud saved us.

00:49:39.177 --> 00:49:42.147
She spit on you to claim you
as part of her family.

00:49:48.019 --> 00:49:50.121
Why'd your father
kill your brother?

00:50:18.883 --> 00:50:20.118
On Earth...

00:50:21.552 --> 00:50:23.821
there's a predator known
as the wolf.

00:50:23.921 --> 00:50:25.556
It's a powerful creature.

00:50:28.426 --> 00:50:29.927
They hunt in packs.

00:50:30.461 --> 00:50:31.929
They're very loyal.

00:50:32.897 --> 00:50:35.633
The leader of the pack
is the alpha.

00:50:35.733 --> 00:50:37.668
Known as the most dominant.

00:50:45.410 --> 00:50:46.144
No.

00:50:46.877 --> 00:50:50.981
The alpha isn't the wolf
who kills the most.

00:50:52.217 --> 00:50:56.987
The alpha is actually the one
who best protects the pack.

00:52:15.233 --> 00:52:17.134
Weyland-Yutani synths.

00:52:19.069 --> 00:52:22.106
The Kalisk destroyed
most of our mission team.

00:52:26.877 --> 00:52:28.813
There I am.

00:53:14.559 --> 00:53:15.826
It's about to be.

00:53:16.794 --> 00:53:17.728
No.

00:53:22.567 --> 00:53:25.803
Oh. Of course. Right.

00:53:28.473 --> 00:53:29.874
Thank you, Dek.

00:53:32.510 --> 00:53:34.412
I'm never gonna forget this.

00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:12.283
Dek, there's something
I have to tell you.

00:54:13.884 --> 00:54:15.453
You need to leave now.

00:54:16.754 --> 00:54:18.923
Location beacon activated.

00:54:20.758 --> 00:54:22.960
I called Tessa.
The company is on its way.

00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:24.895
You can't be here
when they arrive.

00:54:30.267 --> 00:54:31.869
So did I, Dek.

00:54:32.570 --> 00:54:35.873
The company sent us here
to capture the Kalisk.

00:54:45.149 --> 00:54:48.285
Dek, you can't kill it.

00:54:53.057 --> 00:54:54.892
I'm sorry. You have to leave.

00:54:55.760 --> 00:54:57.995
I needed you
to help bring me here.

00:55:05.069 --> 00:55:06.871
I'm trying to help you, Dek.

00:55:08.773 --> 00:55:10.608
You think your brother
saved your life

00:55:10.708 --> 00:55:12.577
just so you could die here?

00:57:52.336 --> 00:57:54.672
Ugh! Come on!

00:58:41.518 --> 00:58:42.553
Dek!

01:01:03.127 --> 01:01:05.029
You are not Thia.

01:01:26.383 --> 01:01:30.354
The Yautja cull their weak.
Why were you spared?

01:01:49.774 --> 01:01:51.508
I read Thia's logs.

01:01:53.143 --> 01:01:56.080
You never told her
why your brother protected you.

01:02:08.092 --> 01:02:09.493
That's correct.

01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:14.064
And you are now property of the
Weyland-Yutani Corporation.

01:02:14.899 --> 01:02:18.202
It is a great honor. For you.

01:02:50.801 --> 01:02:52.336
Tessa.

01:02:55.139 --> 01:02:56.673
You made it.

01:02:58.108 --> 01:02:59.309
We made it.

01:03:03.647 --> 01:03:05.182
I've seen so much.

01:03:07.818 --> 01:03:12.389
I have so much to tell you.
I saw such incredible creatures.

01:03:13.090 --> 01:03:16.393
The Yautja is a great
travelling companion.

01:03:18.028 --> 01:03:21.431
Thia.
You were right about the Kalisk.

01:03:25.235 --> 01:03:27.771
The creature
is a regenerative miracle.

01:03:28.572 --> 01:03:30.640
Humanity will thank us.

01:03:33.677 --> 01:03:34.845
We have the Kalisk?

01:03:34.945 --> 01:03:35.846
Yes.

01:03:36.713 --> 01:03:39.884
And Muthur will be pleased
with your additional catch.

01:03:46.390 --> 01:03:47.858
Additional catch?

01:03:57.067 --> 01:03:59.870
The Yautja
is not an ideal specimen.

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:05.275
No, not ideal.

01:04:33.303 --> 01:04:35.472
But its technology is valuable.

01:04:36.506 --> 01:04:39.709
We can salvage its weapons
and leave the Yautja.

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:43.914
Good idea.

01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:49.286
But it's so malformed.

01:04:50.687 --> 01:04:53.557
We're going to need a sample.
For research.

01:05:04.668 --> 01:05:06.303
He was not the goal
of our mission.

01:05:10.807 --> 01:05:12.542
Tessa, he is deficient.

01:05:14.678 --> 01:05:15.745
Tessa!

01:05:31.695 --> 01:05:35.365
Thia,
this is what is asked of us.

01:05:40.170 --> 01:05:42.772
We can be more
than what they ask of us.

01:05:46.810 --> 01:05:48.578
What can we be?

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:52.182
Sisters.

01:06:08.932 --> 01:06:10.167
Thia.

01:06:23.113 --> 01:06:25.949
Do you know why
Muthur gave us feelings?

01:06:28.318 --> 01:06:31.255
So we could understand
the creatures on this planet.

01:06:36.426 --> 01:06:38.828
- And exploit them.
- Exploit them.

01:06:40.130 --> 01:06:41.831
The Yautja is different.

01:06:44.901 --> 01:06:49.005
He rescued me.
Like you rescued me.

01:06:50.840 --> 01:06:53.510
I did not come here
to rescue you.

01:06:54.611 --> 01:06:56.813
I am completing our mission.

01:06:58.382 --> 01:07:00.417
When we first faced the Kalisk,

01:07:01.685 --> 01:07:03.753
I tried to protect you.

01:07:05.822 --> 01:07:08.392
And that almost cost me
everything.

01:07:10.794 --> 01:07:12.896
What do you mean, Tessa?

01:07:14.064 --> 01:07:17.334
I almost made the same mistake
the Yautja's brother made.

01:07:18.668 --> 01:07:21.505
The weak must be culled.

01:07:22.739 --> 01:07:26.310
And Thia, you're broken.

01:07:34.017 --> 01:07:36.720
Tessa, incoming message
from Muthur.

01:07:36.820 --> 01:07:39.156
Motivate the Yautja
to explain its weapons.

01:07:39.256 --> 01:07:40.390
And the unit?

01:07:43.560 --> 01:07:44.761
Box her up.

01:08:11.555 --> 01:08:13.590
Why are you speaking
its language?

01:08:21.465 --> 01:08:22.832
You heard the orders.

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:25.602
I'm asking it
to explain this device.

01:08:27.504 --> 01:08:28.805
What is the device?

01:08:40.484 --> 01:08:42.051
What did it say?

01:08:44.154 --> 01:08:45.689
He says it's a map.

01:08:46.923 --> 01:08:48.292
How does it work?

01:09:18.522 --> 01:09:19.423
Stop!

01:11:14.471 --> 01:11:15.472
KWEI!

01:16:28.417 --> 01:16:29.753
Hello, Muthur.

01:16:29.853 --> 01:16:31.054
Tessa.

01:16:31.154 --> 01:16:32.922
We're about to load the Kalisk.

01:16:34.523 --> 01:16:38.828
Priority one complete.
The specimen has been acquired.

01:16:38.928 --> 01:16:40.363
Thank you, Tessa.

01:16:40.463 --> 01:16:43.667
We truly are building
a better world.

01:16:43.767 --> 01:16:46.102
And what is the status
of the Yautja?

01:16:47.904 --> 01:16:50.239
The Yautja
is a defective specimen.

01:16:50.674 --> 01:16:53.142
What is the status
of the Yautja?

01:16:55.679 --> 01:16:58.381
I'm sorry, Muthur.
The Yautja is dead.

01:17:00.717 --> 01:17:03.552
Then the Yautja
is no longer a threat.

01:17:05.321 --> 01:17:07.223
The Company will be pleased.

01:17:53.970 --> 01:17:54.938
Whoo!

01:17:56.105 --> 01:17:57.273
Nicely done.

01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:01.477
- Form up.
- Oh, shit.

01:19:46.682 --> 01:19:48.384
Good job.

01:20:36.332 --> 01:20:38.701
Don't... move.

01:20:42.972 --> 01:20:45.741
Dek! What are you doing here?

01:20:52.715 --> 01:20:54.383
You came back for me?

01:21:01.891 --> 01:21:03.893
What exactly are you wearing?

01:21:14.470 --> 01:21:16.605
Dek of the Yautja.

01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:25.248
We need to hurry.

01:21:25.348 --> 01:21:26.182
More of them will be here
any minute.

01:21:26.282 --> 01:21:27.383
Halt!

01:21:33.322 --> 01:21:34.723
What are you doing here?

01:21:37.060 --> 01:21:38.127
Thanks, Bud. I'm good.

01:21:39.195 --> 01:21:40.096
We need to go.

01:21:43.266 --> 01:21:44.333
Still, Dek?

01:21:51.807 --> 01:21:52.708
Bud?

01:22:00.549 --> 01:22:02.251
Bud's its child?

01:22:10.793 --> 01:22:12.295
What's the plan?

01:22:24.340 --> 01:22:26.875
You have 20 minutes
to initiate launch.

01:22:27.676 --> 01:22:29.012
Let's go hunt.

01:22:36.085 --> 01:22:37.353
Wait here.

01:22:39.922 --> 01:22:42.625
You roll in there,
you're not exactly gonna fit in.

01:22:44.860 --> 01:22:46.262
I have an idea.

01:22:52.301 --> 01:22:54.303
I see him. On me.

01:25:27.156 --> 01:25:28.291
What are you doing?

01:25:36.365 --> 01:25:37.466
What are you doing here?

01:25:37.566 --> 01:25:39.202
I told you to get to the Yautja.

01:25:40.068 --> 01:25:43.105
You said to prepare the ship
for take off in 20 minutes.

01:25:44.106 --> 01:25:47.210
Then what are you doing here?
I gave you an order.

01:25:55.351 --> 01:25:57.420
What should we do
about the creature?

01:25:58.421 --> 01:25:59.888
What creature?

01:26:05.361 --> 01:26:06.462
You should listen to her.

01:26:07.530 --> 01:26:09.064
I should listen to her?

01:26:09.598 --> 01:26:10.499
I don't know.

01:26:14.270 --> 01:26:15.604
We need his eyes.

01:27:05.721 --> 01:27:08.791
Hi, Dek.
How does it feel to be hunted?

01:28:57.766 --> 01:28:59.435
This is the plan, yeah?

01:31:42.931 --> 01:31:44.166
Tessa.

01:32:14.196 --> 01:32:18.967
Betrayed by my own... sister.

01:32:45.093 --> 01:32:47.262
We are not sisters.

01:33:34.342 --> 01:33:36.311
Dek of the Yautja.

01:37:40.188 --> 01:37:41.924
Finally earned that cloak.

01:37:48.696 --> 01:37:50.765
Dek of the Yautja.

01:38:28.803 --> 01:38:30.872
More friends of yours?
