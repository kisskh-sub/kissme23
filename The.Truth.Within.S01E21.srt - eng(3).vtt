00:02:31.820 --> 00:02:35.780
[Episode 21]

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.850
How did you get to He City?

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:55.610
Where's Nuo Sha?

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:05.410
Where is he?

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:10.170
Investigated for so long,

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:11.890
and you still don't know

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:13.340
who exactly he is?

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:16.010
Sen!

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.060
Just cooperate with us!

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.060
Cooperate?

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.850
Fine.

00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.010
You want Nuo Sha?

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:27.980
I can send you to him.

00:03:29.030 --> 00:03:29.730
Is this funny?

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:32.100
I asked you, where is he?

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.130
In hell.

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.890
Sen!

00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.130
Save me!

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:42.100
Save the General!

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:48.780
In Decang City,

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:50.170
there's a drug lord

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.260
named Nuo Sha,

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:52.410
known as General.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:54.130
He is very mysterious.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.380
Because until now,

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:56.260
no one

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:57.850
has seen his real face.

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:05.570
Didn't you see it yourself?

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:09.410
Wu Ya

00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:11.010
is Nuo Sha.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.540
What's this?

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:43.250
Where's the last page?

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:45.490
Release

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:46.850
the people you've locked up,

00:04:47.310 --> 00:04:47.980
and I'll tell you.

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.140
You really think

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:58.050
I won't kill him?

00:04:58.870 --> 00:04:59.410
Sizhe!

00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:00.930
Sizhe!

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:01.780
Sizhe!

00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.460
Stop playing tricks.

00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:07.900
Just cooperate!

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.220
Fine.

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:11.540
Kill this man first,

00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:12.850
and I'll cooperate.

00:05:12.870 --> 00:05:13.490
Listen.

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:15.020
You're a suspect now.

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:16.140
This is your chance

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.460
for redemption.

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.780
You're in no position

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.700
to bargain with us.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:21.050
He killed my brother!

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:23.730
A life for a life.

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:25.460
I'll have my

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.410
revenge.

00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:30.370
Traitor!

00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:31.930
Stop!

00:05:33.430 --> 00:05:35.100
He was an undercover

00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:35.810
agent by my brother.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:38.810
He betrayed my brother.

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:41.700
Come out!

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:45.370
Traitor, come out!

00:06:06.190 --> 00:06:06.780
Brother?

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:21.050
See these people?

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.610
See them?

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.660
Your brother killed them all.

00:06:28.040 --> 00:06:29.170
Your brother is a dealer.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.170
I'll bust them all!

00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:42.810
Mr. Wu.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.170
Drop the act.

00:06:47.070 --> 00:06:48.580
We checked the nursing home.

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:50.050
I ran the tests.

00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.810
It's been confirmed.

00:06:53.870 --> 00:06:54.780
The pills Mrs. Wu took

00:06:56.480 --> 00:06:57.610
are designer drugs.

00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:00.290
You must have

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:02.140
realized she was addicted.

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:03.610
That's why you

00:07:03.630 --> 00:07:04.810
sent her there.

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.050
What pills?

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:10.020
She's at the nursing home

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:11.850
for depression.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:25.370
Sizhe.

00:07:26.510 --> 00:07:26.900
Sizhe.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.100
Let me explain.

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:34.290
I... I only did it

00:07:36.360 --> 00:07:37.580
because they forced me.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.810
They forced me to make drugs.

00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:42.140
I never intended to use medicine

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:43.660
to develop drugs.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.660
So,

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:49.050
you admit

00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.980
you made those drugs?

00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:53.660
I did.

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:55.810
They threatened Guifen.

00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:57.930
If I didn't cooperate,

00:07:57.950 --> 00:07:58.850
they'd kill her.

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:03.250
What about Li Ming and Chen Chuchuan?

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:04.900
When did they

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.730
get involved?

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:07.140
Mr. Wu.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:09.370
This stuff...

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:11.170
Do you even know

00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:11.780
the demand for it?

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:13.460
If we mass-produce it,

00:08:14.270 --> 00:08:15.700
the profits would be insane!

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.340
I'm warning you, Li Ming.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:20.660
I'm making medicine.

00:08:21.360 --> 00:08:22.220
I'm not touching drugs.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.100
It's medicine! Medicine!

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.490
But even to develop medicine,

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:28.490
the following

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:31.170
equipment and research

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.730
all need funding, right?

00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:34.770
After Li Ming died,

00:08:35.480 --> 00:08:36.180
you didn't

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.420
stop the research.

00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:40.060
Is that medicine? It's drug!

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:40.340
Mr. Wu.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.420
I said it's medicine!

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:43.100
Just stop this, okay?

00:08:43.270 --> 00:08:44.060
Whether it's drug

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:45.300
depends on how you use it!

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.730
We've come this far.

00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:53.580
No turning back.

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:55.100
Otherwise,

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:56.890
what about Guifen?

00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.250
What about you?

00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:01.220
Yes.

00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:03.580
I...

00:09:04.240 --> 00:09:05.220
Seeing Jiangxue

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:06.060
makes me happy.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:10.370
But the price

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:13.100
of this happiness is too high.

00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:18.060
I've always made medicine.

00:09:19.030 --> 00:09:20.370
But they wanted drugs!

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.130
I didn't expect

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:24.730
it would end like this.

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:28.580
Li Ming and Chuchuan,

00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:30.610
they died because of you!

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:31.980
Don't you

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.370
regret any of it?

00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:34.850
Their deaths weren't my fault.

00:09:35.270 --> 00:09:36.340
I have principles.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.060
The killing

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:40.890
was all their doing.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:42.300
Enough of that.

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:44.700
You, Qi!

00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:47.100
Give me the last page now.

00:09:47.870 --> 00:09:48.650
Otherwise,

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:50.340
your precious professor

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.370
and his wife

00:09:51.870 --> 00:09:53.130
will be fed to the dogs!

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:54.460
Understand?

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.130
Sizhe.

00:09:58.510 --> 00:10:00.940
Just give the formula, okay?

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:02.730
Save Guifen.

00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.370
Save her!

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:08.700
Feng Zhengxi.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:10.820
Bring Mrs. Wu over.

00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:13.340
I want to ensure her safety.

00:10:22.240 --> 00:10:23.610
Based on the lab tests,

00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:24.580
the soil from

00:10:24.600 --> 00:10:25.980
Mr. Qi's home contains

00:10:26.080 --> 00:10:27.980
high levels of methamphetamine.

00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.370
That's the main raw material

00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:30.250
for making drugs.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.250
We're certain

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:33.250
that wherever this soil is,

00:10:33.550 --> 00:10:35.300
there's a drug factory.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.700
Can you locate

00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:38.180
where the soil comes from?

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.180
It's hard to tell.

00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:44.250
But the soil

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:45.460
is highly saline.

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:48.100
It could be from

00:10:48.630 --> 00:10:49.940
rising groundwater levels

00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:52.340
saturating the rock.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:53.300
Mr. Zhuang.

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.850
In English, please?

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:57.220
Simply put,

00:10:57.510 --> 00:11:00.060
it's likely near a reservoir,

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:01.820
or where one

00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:03.250
used to be.

00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:05.250
But it's not certain.

00:11:06.150 --> 00:11:06.580
Su.

00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.460
Check for matching reservoirs.

00:11:08.870 --> 00:11:09.130
Okay.

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:10.100
I'll do it now.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:14.580
Han.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:17.010
I think I found

00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.530
a way to break Sen.

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:21.650
Sen.

00:11:22.030 --> 00:11:23.060
Do you know

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:24.370
the details back then?

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:26.730
I only know he was undercover.

00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:28.820
He's the one

00:11:29.390 --> 00:11:30.730
who shot my brother.

00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.650
The day your brother was killed,

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.890
we didn't plan to act early.

00:11:36.670 --> 00:11:38.100
But we got a tip-off,

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:40.220
so we had to move in.

00:11:42.240 --> 00:11:43.130
He was undercover.

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.820
Why would he need a tip-off?

00:11:45.840 --> 00:11:47.220
We didn't have

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:48.300
concrete evidence then.

00:11:48.750 --> 00:11:49.300
We didn't know

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:50.610
where the hideout was.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:52.730
I'd only just joined.

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:54.650
Our original plan

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:55.650
was to take them alive.

00:11:56.390 --> 00:11:57.490
We only moved

00:11:57.870 --> 00:11:58.650
because of that tip.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:00.980
Think about it.

00:12:01.750 --> 00:12:03.420
With Li Ming and your brother dead,

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.650
who benefited the most?

00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:11.220
I'm planning

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:13.370
to build a factory.

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:16.460
We can work together.

00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:18.100
Going solo?

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.250
Aren't you afraid of the cook?

00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.060
All you want

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:28.490
is just

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:29.650
a steady supply.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:31.850
I have the formula.

00:12:33.390 --> 00:12:34.180
You have the market.

00:12:35.030 --> 00:12:36.530
We'll be swimming in money.

00:12:39.390 --> 00:12:40.420
Raw Diamond was already

00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:42.180
on the police's radar.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:44.100
To save himself,

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.010
the real cook

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:47.490
framed Li Ming

00:12:47.510 --> 00:12:48.420
as a scapegoat.

00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:50.580
He set up the bust

00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:51.610
with Cha Kun.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:52.100
Cops?

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:54.220
You framed me!

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.420
Then he lay low

00:12:56.440 --> 00:12:57.100
in the shadows

00:12:57.550 --> 00:12:58.850
to wait for a comeback.

00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:00.130
The cook

00:13:00.790 --> 00:13:02.420
is the real mastermind.

00:13:03.030 --> 00:13:03.460
Sen.

00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:04.980
Cooperate with us.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.180
Bring him to justice.

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:08.300
That's the only way

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.130
to avenge your brother.

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:22.300
Ning, samples collected.

00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:39.700
Our investigation shows

00:13:39.840 --> 00:13:40.820
villagers claim

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:41.610
the wastewater

00:13:41.630 --> 00:13:42.980
is from the upstream valley.

00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.460
The valley is huge.

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:45.700
We still can't

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.610
locate the drug factory.

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:48.940
We need

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:50.180
a more efficient way.

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.650
Qi Sizhe has been held

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:52.730
for over ten hours.

00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.940
We're running out of time.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:13:59.100
Sizhe?

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:00.370
Sizhe!

00:14:00.790 --> 00:14:01.530
Sizhe!

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:02.060
Mrs. Wu.

00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:02.820
I'm sorry!

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:04.180
This is all my fault!

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:04.730
Sizhe!

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.340
Save Guifen!

00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:07.060
Mrs. Wu!

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:08.370
Save her!

00:14:16.150 --> 00:14:17.300
You've seen her.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:18.940
Now, write it.

00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:25.490
Paper and pen.

00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.610
Formula for

00:14:35.630 --> 00:14:36.610
stabilizing the drug is here.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.060
Get out.

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:42.610
Out!

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:26.420
Mr. Bai.

00:15:27.790 --> 00:15:28.610
The cartel replied

00:15:28.630 --> 00:15:30.220
the text I sent with Sen's phone.

00:15:34.080 --> 00:15:35.300
I know it's risky,

00:15:35.960 --> 00:15:36.850
but it's

00:15:36.870 --> 00:15:37.980
the fastest way.

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:39.300
I'll pose as Nuo Sha

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:40.490
to meet them.

00:15:40.840 --> 00:15:41.940
Have Sen help us

00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:43.100
find the cook.

00:15:43.870 --> 00:15:44.770
Sen's goal

00:15:44.790 --> 00:15:46.010
now matches ours.

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:48.010
The new formula must come

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:49.130
from Sizhe's work.

00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:50.420
So he's in

00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:51.130
grave danger.

00:15:51.630 --> 00:15:52.700
I'll send coordinates

00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:53.730
upon arrival.

00:15:54.270 --> 00:15:55.060
Please approve, sir.

00:15:58.550 --> 00:15:59.730
Is this Sen trustworthy?

00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.650
Don't forget

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:03.250
he still hates you.

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:30.460
After discussion,

00:16:30.870 --> 00:16:32.370
Mr. Bai and I agree.

00:16:32.390 --> 00:16:33.180
Han Feng

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.490
will go undercover.

00:16:39.630 --> 00:16:40.850
Han Feng will take Sen

00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.610
to the meeting point

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:43.490
set by the cook.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:46.460
Lixing.

00:16:46.840 --> 00:16:48.100
Track and deploy teams.

00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:56.180
Su and Yuanyang, support them.

00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:02.010
Once we find Sizhe

00:17:02.150 --> 00:17:03.300
and he's safe,

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:04.810
Han Feng will signal us.

00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.050
Once signaled,

00:17:18.350 --> 00:17:19.330
raid the place

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:20.460
and arrest the cook.

00:17:20.720 --> 00:17:21.860
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:39.660
Boss.

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:40.530
They're here.

00:17:55.110 --> 00:17:55.900
Nuo Sha?

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.380
Old man?

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.810
Finally, we meet.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.490
That belly of yours

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:10.050
needs some exercise.

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:12.700
So?

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:14.010
About the new product...

00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.620
It's all right here.

00:18:19.030 --> 00:18:20.180
A complete success.

00:18:22.510 --> 00:18:24.090
Kidnapping that cop

00:18:24.750 --> 00:18:25.940
really paid off.

00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:29.180
I've got to hand it to you.

00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:30.900
Daring to kidnap a cop.

00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:33.900
So?

00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:35.490
Is he dead yet?

00:18:37.440 --> 00:18:38.980
Do you want him alive

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:40.570
or dead?

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:51.490
That depends on

00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:53.090
your preference, old man.

00:18:57.750 --> 00:18:58.290
Let's go.

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:00.050
Show me

00:19:00.070 --> 00:19:00.770
your productivity.

00:19:03.030 --> 00:19:04.770
Productivity is no issue.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:05.770
We can supply plenty.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:08.090
But can you handle

00:19:08.510 --> 00:19:09.900
this kind of volume?

00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:13.490
You know who I am.

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:16.860
If you talk like that,

00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:18.180
you're not being sincere.

00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:20.330
Doubting my orders?

00:19:47.310 --> 00:19:47.860
Shall we?

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.250
Your security and

00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:06.570
secrecy are top-notch.

00:20:07.160 --> 00:20:08.420
No wonder the cops can't find it.

00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:09.700
Indeed.

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:11.250
Well?

00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.420
Can we talk business now?

00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:14.770
Of course.

00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:16.730
But not with you.

00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.090
Excuse me?

00:20:23.590 --> 00:20:25.660
I deal with the cook directly.

00:20:26.590 --> 00:20:27.290
You are not him.

00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:30.770
As expected of General Nuo Sha.

00:20:31.590 --> 00:20:32.140
Forgive me.

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:34.810
These are sensitive times.

00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:36.140
Better safe than sorry.

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:37.180
I understand.

00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:49.700
Suit yourself.

00:20:50.030 --> 00:20:50.980
I'll go get the cook.

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:52.860
Okay.

00:21:02.750 --> 00:21:03.380
This way.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:21.900
My man here says

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:23.940
he's seen you somewhere before.

00:22:36.310 --> 00:22:37.180
Mr. Cao, Mr. Bai.

00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.180
Mr. Han sent the signal.

00:22:38.750 --> 00:22:39.530
Move in now!

00:22:39.920 --> 00:22:41.140
We must destroy

00:22:41.310 --> 00:22:42.220
the drug factory quickly.

00:22:42.550 --> 00:22:43.900
Bring Han Feng and Qi Sizhe

00:22:44.070 --> 00:22:45.380
back to us untouched!

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:46.420
Yes, sir.

00:22:47.590 --> 00:22:48.010
Move!

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:13.570
Get out.

00:23:14.510 --> 00:23:15.570
This is a sterile lab.

00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:51.940
You can't treat him like this.

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:53.530
Untie him.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:55.770
Let's talk this out.

00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.290
You never listen to me.

00:24:08.960 --> 00:24:09.940
He's with HCPD,

00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:10.770
the Captain.

00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:13.220
Messing with him

00:24:13.750 --> 00:24:14.730
is a bold move.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:17.010
I'll be gentle.

00:24:17.590 --> 00:24:18.700
It won't hurt as much.

00:24:25.550 --> 00:24:26.380
Wu Yongchang.

00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:28.460
You hid it well.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:33.050
What are you doing?

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:34.090
I told you

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.010
he's a cop!

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.490
Don't you want a way out?

00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:38.490
Wu Yongchang.

00:24:39.480 --> 00:24:40.700
Stop the act.

00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:42.900
Everything before

00:24:44.590 --> 00:24:46.050
was your doing, right?

00:24:58.200 --> 00:24:59.420
I'm the one who got away.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:02.140
The one who got away?

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:05.570
Qi Sizhe was right.

00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:07.940
Raw Diamond and the designer drug

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.730
were all your doing.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:13.010
Medicine is medicine.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:14.860
Drug is drug.

00:25:16.240 --> 00:25:17.330
I always tried

00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:19.290
to stay away from drugs.

00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:23.330
I expected the same from my students.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:25.660
Sadly,

00:25:27.110 --> 00:25:28.330
Li Ming wouldn't listen.

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:29.770
Stop the act.

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:32.570
I gave the tip-off back then.

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:34.700
Otherwise, you'd never have

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:35.810
found Li Ming so fast.

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:43.010
Good.

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:43.620
Be safe.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:44.250
My pleasure

00:25:49.030 --> 00:25:50.460
Hello, Police?

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.290
I want to report a drug deal.

00:25:53.110 --> 00:25:54.730
So that anonymous tip

00:25:56.310 --> 00:25:57.090
was yours?

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:00.730
Just to research that stuff?

00:26:02.550 --> 00:26:03.660
Have you no humanity left?

00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.700
I'm saving lives!

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:05.570
Whose life?

00:26:05.590 --> 00:26:06.770
I'm not like them!

00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:07.700
Not like who?

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:09.620
You're worse than all of them!

00:26:10.160 --> 00:26:11.490
Stop lying to yourself.

00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:16.940
Yu Fei.

00:26:19.590 --> 00:26:20.570
Was it you?

00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:23.140
Did you kill her?

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:25.090
Talk.

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:27.420
Did you kill Yu Fei?

00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.050
There's one thing

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:02.220
you might not know yet.

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:04.700
The day Yu Fei died,

00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:06.330
you met Li Ming,

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:07.140
didn't you?

00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:11.730
What do you mean?

00:27:13.750 --> 00:27:14.220
You're here.

00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:16.900
This way.

00:27:29.350 --> 00:27:31.180
I gave you a chance.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.250
It's your fault!

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:33.810
You failed to save her!

00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:34.940
Failed to save Yu Fei!

00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:36.290
Wu Yongchang.

00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:42.090
Mr. Han.

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.380
Do you feel

00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:45.730
deeply regretful now?

00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:47.380
And ashamed?

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:48.860
No matter.

00:27:49.510 --> 00:27:50.570
I'll end your pain.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:53.660
Stop.

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:57.380
Mr. Qi is here.

00:27:59.030 --> 00:27:59.490
Han Feng.

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:01.050
Perfect.

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:03.050
Your dear Captain

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.090
wants to try the new drug.

00:28:06.070 --> 00:28:08.420
If the formula is correct,

00:28:09.270 --> 00:28:10.380
he should be fine.

00:28:13.750 --> 00:28:14.420
Wu Yongchang.

00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:17.050
Let Han Feng go.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.180
I'll be your test subject.

00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:20.140
No way.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.290
I can't let you get hurt.

00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:24.730
If the formula is wrong,

00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:26.620
who will pay the price?

00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:28.660
Please.

00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:53.460
Mr. Wu.

00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.530
It's not too late to stop.

00:29:06.240 --> 00:29:07.010
Leave him alone!

00:29:07.750 --> 00:29:08.460
Come at me!

00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:09.530
Wu Yongchang!

00:29:10.310 --> 00:29:11.330
Come at me if you dare!

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:13.660
You coward!

00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:14.730
Yellow-belly!

00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:16.420
Do it yourself if you dare!

00:29:17.070 --> 00:29:17.940
Coward!

00:29:18.750 --> 00:29:20.250
Do it yourself!

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.290
Stop it!

00:29:22.510 --> 00:29:23.140
Han Feng!

00:29:25.070 --> 00:29:25.770
Han Feng!

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:31.050
You...

00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:32.660
You...

00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:38.220
Do it...

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:39.900
yourself...

00:29:53.270 --> 00:29:53.860
Han Feng!

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:55.530
Han Feng!

00:30:03.640 --> 00:30:04.380
Still wrong.

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:11.700
Sizhe.

00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:13.530
Sizhe.

00:30:14.030 --> 00:30:15.770
This formula is incomplete.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:16.860
Right?

00:30:18.750 --> 00:30:19.380
Wu Yongchang.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.090
Just give them the formula!

00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:22.620
They'll kill!

00:30:25.590 --> 00:30:27.090
Stop making mistakes.

00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.530
How many more must die?

00:30:30.790 --> 00:30:31.860
You gave the formula!

00:30:32.350 --> 00:30:33.180
If he dies,

00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:34.290
it's on you!

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.420
I want no more deaths.

00:30:39.830 --> 00:30:41.380
No more deaths!

00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:51.660
Cops!

00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:53.900
Run!

00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.220
Cops are here!

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:57.490
Run! Get out!

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:58.420
Hurry!

00:30:59.750 --> 00:31:01.730
Go! Leave them!

00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:09.730
Han Feng.

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:10.810
How are you?

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:20.220
Quick!

00:31:26.270 --> 00:31:27.140
Pour it all out!

00:31:28.160 --> 00:31:28.620
Fast!

00:31:29.310 --> 00:31:30.010
Dump it all!

00:31:34.310 --> 00:31:35.220
Go get Wu Yongchang.

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:36.570
I'll chase Feng Zhengxi.

00:31:36.830 --> 00:31:37.330
Careful.

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:01.770
Move!

00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:02.330
Move!

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:35.810
Careful.

00:32:36.640 --> 00:32:37.090
Watch out.

00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:38.810
Come on.

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:40.980
Yongchang.

00:32:41.510 --> 00:32:42.700
Let's turn ourselves in.

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:45.860
Wu Yongchang!

00:32:50.270 --> 00:32:51.620
What are you doing?

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:53.220
For my brother's life,

00:32:53.720 --> 00:32:54.620
you pay today!

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:56.330
You both must die!

00:33:28.270 --> 00:33:28.770
Guifen.

00:33:29.510 --> 00:33:30.380
Don't cry.

00:33:31.750 --> 00:33:32.810
Promise me.

00:33:34.070 --> 00:33:35.250
Turn yourself in.

00:33:37.070 --> 00:33:37.770
Don't...

00:33:39.550 --> 00:33:42.140
make more mistakes.

00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.050
Okay.

00:33:44.550 --> 00:33:44.940
Okay.

00:33:46.550 --> 00:33:47.810
Stay with me!

00:33:48.070 --> 00:33:48.770
Hang on!

00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:58.090
Wu Yongchang!

00:33:58.110 --> 00:33:58.660
Guifen!

00:33:59.070 --> 00:33:59.770
It's your turn!

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:00.420
Hold on!

00:34:00.830 --> 00:34:01.380
Hang on!

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.820
Why?

00:34:26.760 --> 00:34:28.650
Why punish me like this?

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:32.980
Wu Yongchang.

00:34:33.590 --> 00:34:34.530
Surrender and come back.

00:34:36.000 --> 00:34:37.570
Mrs. Wu would want that too!

00:34:54.510 --> 00:34:55.130
Help them out!

00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:04.860
Don't move!

00:35:10.880 --> 00:35:11.300
Mr. Han.

00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:17.460
Su.

00:35:18.030 --> 00:35:19.260
Evacuate the hostages now.

00:35:22.190 --> 00:35:22.900
Sizhe.

00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:25.980
I'm sorry.

00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.090
I failed Yu Fei.

00:35:33.070 --> 00:35:33.610
Yu Fei?

00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.380
How did she die exactly?

00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:45.340
Mr. Wu.

00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:48.050
What now?

00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:49.570
Give her the drug.

00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.050
It'll control her.

00:35:53.440 --> 00:35:55.130
But she's Sizhe's girlfriend.

00:35:56.550 --> 00:35:57.570
Sentimentality

00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:59.050
achieves nothing.

00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.170
I'm sorry.

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.050
Sorry about this.

00:36:36.630 --> 00:36:37.420
I have to

00:36:37.710 --> 00:36:38.690
keep you here for now.

00:36:42.070 --> 00:36:42.980
I can't untie you.

00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:45.050
Wait here for me.

00:36:45.360 --> 00:36:45.900
Be right back.

00:36:53.510 --> 00:36:54.010
You're here.

00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:17.690
Any problems?

00:37:18.320 --> 00:37:18.900
None.

00:37:27.190 --> 00:37:27.820
My pleasure.

00:37:42.510 --> 00:37:42.980
Fei.

00:37:44.110 --> 00:37:44.690
Hang on.

00:38:37.670 --> 00:38:39.010
Did you really kill Fei?

00:38:44.150 --> 00:38:45.460
I killed your girlfriend.

00:38:48.070 --> 00:38:48.490
I...

00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:50.820
I ruined Ming.

00:38:52.190 --> 00:38:52.900
And Chuchuan.

00:38:58.000 --> 00:38:59.050
Just kill me.

00:38:59.360 --> 00:39:00.000
Alright?

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:01.300
Kill me.

00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:02.860
Let me die with Guifen.

00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:05.420
It all should end.

00:39:36.590 --> 00:39:37.090
Drop it!

00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:41.050
Peng Ba.

00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.010
Let me.

00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:53.420
Wu Yongchang.

00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:54.860
What are you doing?

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:13.460
What are you doing?

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:15.170
No!

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:16.260
Wu Yongchang!

00:40:18.230 --> 00:40:18.740
Wu Yongchang!

00:43:42.280 --> 00:43:43.010
Fei.

00:43:44.510 --> 00:43:46.130
Sizhe and I are here to see you.

00:43:47.630 --> 00:43:49.010
It's been a while.

00:43:50.070 --> 00:43:51.340
Don't be mad at us.

00:43:55.320 --> 00:43:56.460
Your killer

00:43:58.190 --> 00:43:59.980
was finally caught by

00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.210
your thick-headed boyfriend.

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:08.260
He is actually better than me.

00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.340
You chose well.

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:15.210
Fei.

00:44:17.590 --> 00:44:18.420
Your dream

00:44:19.400 --> 00:44:20.530
was always to be

00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:21.740
a great forensic doctor.

00:44:24.360 --> 00:44:24.940
Someday,

00:44:26.030 --> 00:44:27.130
I'll carry your dream

00:44:28.590 --> 00:44:29.460
forward.

00:44:33.630 --> 00:44:34.340
Come on.

00:44:38.070 --> 00:44:38.570
Here.

00:44:43.510 --> 00:44:44.460
Staying in He City?

00:44:51.590 --> 00:44:52.050
And you?

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.300
Will you stay in CID

00:44:56.880 --> 00:44:57.900
or go back to Narcotics?

00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.380
I haven't decided yet.

00:45:01.190 --> 00:45:01.820
You think

00:45:02.510 --> 00:45:03.460
transfers are that easy?

00:45:07.190 --> 00:45:07.740
Han Feng.

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:09.610
Remember

00:45:10.230 --> 00:45:11.420
what you said before?

00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:15.210
If I quit Narcotics,

00:45:15.550 --> 00:45:17.820
I'll join your team in CID.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:18.740
Together,

00:45:19.110 --> 00:45:19.980
no case is unsolvable.

00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:21.130
You said it.

00:45:21.590 --> 00:45:22.650
Don't back out later.

00:45:24.710 --> 00:45:25.260
It's a deal.

00:45:27.670 --> 00:45:28.300
Deal.

00:45:30.630 --> 00:45:31.980
As long as we team up,

00:45:34.110 --> 00:45:35.530
no case is unsolvable.

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:36.260
Right.

00:45:38.920 --> 00:45:39.490
You remembered.

00:45:40.710 --> 00:45:41.740
Hard to forget.

00:45:44.710 --> 00:45:45.380
In that case,

00:45:46.630 --> 00:45:48.050
let's both stay in He City

00:45:49.110 --> 00:45:49.940
and keep teaming up.

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:54.570
Sounds like a plan.

00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:21.260
Don't forget.

00:46:22.190 --> 00:46:23.050
There's one more person.
