00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.740
I'm so sorry. I shouldn't have kept you
talking about all that.

00:00:03.980 --> 00:00:05.080
Please come again.

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.240
Come again!

00:00:06.310 --> 00:00:07.310
Okay.

00:00:10.450 --> 00:00:11.720
Hello.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:14.750
What do you mean the banner's gone?

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:18.760
You think someone reported it
and had it removed?

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:33.710
Right.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.050
Right.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:53.660
You don't think it was those jerks
who did this to Suk Hee, do you?

00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:02.330
You can see yourself out. The door's open.

00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:04.300
It's got to be them.

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:06.940
I'm not going to let them
get away with this.

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:14.550
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:21.990
What? "Not going to let them
get away with this?"

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.990
As if you could do anything about it.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.260
Is something wrong?

00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:30.360
Go to the office. Now.
There's something we need to take care of.

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.330
- What on earth...
- I said, go!

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.830
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:19.510
- I'm back.
- Jang Mi.

00:02:19.940 --> 00:02:23.720
They must have something to hide.
That's why they took the banner down.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:26.350
Dad?

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:30.720
- Jang Mi. Good, you're home.
- Why? What's going on?

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:34.490
- Our banner has been removed.
- What?

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.030
What do you mean?
How could it have been taken down so soon?

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.130
You know that lady who sells corn
from her truck in that neighborhood?

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:43.100
Yes, I know who you mean.
She works over in Taean.

00:02:43.170 --> 00:02:45.670
I asked her for a favor.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:49.110
I asked her to keep an eye on the banner
when she drives by.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:51.810
But apparently, some public officials
showed up today,

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.710
said a complaint had been filed,
and took it down.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:56.110
A complaint?

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:57.850
Unbelievable.

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.020
Some people have too much free time.
Who reports something like that?

00:03:02.090 --> 00:03:03.490
I know, right?

00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:08.090
This has to be the work of the people
who did this to Suk Hee...

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:09.530
That will be 18 dollars.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:11.730
Yes, here you are.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.000
- Thanks.
- I'm sorry.

00:03:15.930 --> 00:03:17.040
(The banner has been removed.)

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:18.500
The banner has been removed.

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:29.280
Looks like you reported an illegal banner.

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:34.390
It was blocking a traffic light
and was a hazard.

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:35.690
So...

00:03:36.550 --> 00:03:37.590
That's weird.

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:42.730
That customer from earlier also said
she reported an illegal banner...

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.300
Why are so many people filing complaints?

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.300
Who did?

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.600
Oh, that customer who was just here.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:54.270
She said she reported an illegal banner
because it was a driving hazard.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:57.940
I can't tell you
how disheartening that was to hear.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:00.310
Ours isn’t located anywhere
that would obstruct driving.

00:04:00.310 --> 00:04:01.410
Exactly.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:06.150
We desperately put up that banner,
and they can't even look the other way?

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:10.760
I almost told that customer off,
but I bit my tongue.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:12.020
Good thing you did.

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:16.290
People like her will never understand
how desperate we are.

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:21.200
Anyway, don't you think the person
who reported our banner is suspicious?

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.000
I'm sure the person
who filed the complaint...

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.670
is connected to Suk Hee's accident.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.910
You're right. I think so too.

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:45.720
What's taking him so long?

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.600
So? How did it go?

00:04:53.930 --> 00:04:55.730
Yes, it's been handled.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:59.300
You made sure they can't find out
who filed the complaint, right?

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.440
Yes, don't worry.

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:05.080
Good. Let those pathetic fools
hang their banners.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.640
A lot of good it will do them.

00:05:24.500 --> 00:05:25.660
Knock, knock.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.030
Chef Kang?

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.800
How about some tea?

00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:36.310
Don't be so stuffy. It's our break time.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:37.910
There's no reason we can't have
a cup of tea, is there?

00:05:38.580 --> 00:05:40.450
Unlike some people, I'm not idle.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:44.080
Playing hard to get
is only attractive in moderation.

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:46.520
And I'm not a very patient person.

00:05:47.090 --> 00:05:48.790
Your patience won't be required.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:51.860
You're a distraction. Please leave.

00:05:54.230 --> 00:05:55.230
Jun Ho!

00:05:56.860 --> 00:05:59.860
Oh my goodness. Director Ma,
I didn't realize you were here.

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.900
You're on a first-name
basis with Chef Kang?

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:04.940
Well...

00:06:05.670 --> 00:06:08.710
We've just been close ever since
we were in school together.

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.680
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here to work, of course,

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.310
unlike some people.

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:20.490
- Here are the junior chef résumés.
- Okay.

00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.220
I'll review these, Assistant Manager Jin.

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:26.390
Director Ma, are you just going
to keep standing there?

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:28.130
Getting in my way?

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:32.860
Just pretend I'm your shadow.
Then I won't be in your way, will I?

00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:41.910
You're sure CEO Chae isn't here, right?

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:43.540
I'm telling you, she's not.

00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:47.710
The CEO should be at the office now.
Why would she be here?

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.350
She's the CEO.
She does whatever she wants.

00:06:49.410 --> 00:06:51.420
So, what? You're saying
you don't believe me?

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.380
No, it's fine.
As long as Hwa Young isn't here.

00:06:54.920 --> 00:06:59.320
Chairman! I'm here!

00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:00.630
Darn it.

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:05.200
CEO Chae, Yeom San Wol just came home
and is meeting with the Chairman.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.400
Yeom San Wol.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:11.440
So you're ignoring my warning
and picking a fight with me, is that it?

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.970
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.810
Don't you dare treat Mrs. Yeom
so disrespectfully.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:25.650
If you keep treating Mrs. Yeom like that,
I won't let it slide.

00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:29.050
Why aren't you saying anything?

00:07:29.450 --> 00:07:30.450
Father.

00:07:30.660 --> 00:07:32.760
She's a friend of mine.

00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:35.130
- How could you and my friend...
- Enough.

00:07:36.060 --> 00:07:38.600
How dare you meddle
in your father-in-law's affairs?

00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:41.600
Fine, Yeom San Wol.

00:07:42.770 --> 00:07:46.270
I'll show you exactly
who you're messing with.

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:54.380
Take personnel action against Jin Hong Ju,
Yeom San Wol's daughter, immediately.

00:07:54.550 --> 00:07:55.550
Yes, ma'am.

00:07:59.850 --> 00:08:04.420
She should know by now
that the more she acts up,

00:08:04.490 --> 00:08:06.360
the worse it will be for her daughter.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:10.700
If she's a fool,
she should know her place.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.000
Who does she think she is, challenging me?

00:08:15.300 --> 00:08:17.300
That feels so good.

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.670
See? This is why
I wish I could come every day...

00:08:21.770 --> 00:08:23.810
and give you a nice massage, Chairman.

00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.580
But I'm too afraid of CEO Chae
to even come here.

00:08:28.080 --> 00:08:31.450
Don't worry.
I gave her a piece of my mind,

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:35.120
so CEO Chae won't be able
to say a thing to you.

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:38.190
- Really?
- Of course. You can bet on it.

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:40.520
Who would dare disobey me?

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:43.790
Chairman.

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:48.000
You're the only one
who ever looks out for me.

00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:50.570
Thank you for saying that.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.440
Jang Mi.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.510
Don't overdo it with your injured hand.
I'll do it.

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:06.420
It's fine, Dad. It's all healed.
I'm wearing a glove to keep it dry.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:09.650
I swear, whoever did this
to my little princess's hand...

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:11.220
is going to get it from me.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:15.490
Dad, do you really think
I would've just let it go?

00:09:15.590 --> 00:09:16.960
I already taught them a lesson.

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.900
I get my temper from you, you know.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:21.670
What?

00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.440
That's my girl.

00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:34.080
"Let's Have a Drink" is a dance-trot song.

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.610
Dance-trot.
Not that old-fashioned cheesy stuff.

00:09:36.610 --> 00:09:39.320
You have to go full-throttle
the whole time. Got it?

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:40.920
- Right.
- Listen.

00:09:41.320 --> 00:09:44.060
Let's have a drink

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:47.360
Let's go all night long
Let's have a drink

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:49.090
Tonight, right here,

00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:51.960
Make the "o" sound a little nasally.

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:53.830
It has to be cutesy like this.

00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:56.300
Oh.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:58.440
Oh.

00:10:01.270 --> 00:10:02.270
Just copy him, Tae Pyung.

00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:07.210
It's okay. Just relax and follow his lead.

00:10:07.210 --> 00:10:08.950
You must nail the audition today, right?

00:10:14.490 --> 00:10:17.460
Let's have a drink

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.830
Let's go all night long
Let's have a drink

00:10:21.330 --> 00:10:24.160
Tonight, you and I

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.330
Hold on!

00:10:25.860 --> 00:10:28.330
Hey, stop with the cheesy old-school vibe.

00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:31.570
I'm sorry, sir.
He's not normally like this.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.740
I'm sorry to ask, sir,
could you please show me again?

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:39.780
All right, last time. Listen up.
You know I was in Special Forces, right?

00:10:39.910 --> 00:10:41.480
- Yes, sir.
- Focus!

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:42.550
Focus!

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:44.320
Here I go.

00:10:45.050 --> 00:10:47.950
Let's have a drink

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:52.260
Let's go all night long
Let's have a drink

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.290
Do the money spin

00:10:54.290 --> 00:10:56.090
And another one

00:10:56.090 --> 00:10:57.430
- And keep drinking
- Excuse me, sir.

00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:06.240
Are you laughing?

00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.010
- No.
- Are you messing with me?

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:10.710
- No, sir!
- Sit! Stand! About-face! Hit the deck!

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:13.110
Hey, wait a second. Hey!
What's your father do?

00:11:13.240 --> 00:11:14.550
My father runs a side dish shop.

00:11:23.990 --> 00:11:26.890
Let's have a drink

00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.990
Let's go all night long
Let's have a drink

00:11:30.390 --> 00:11:33.060
Tonight, you and I

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:36.830
We'll become one and keep drinking

00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:37.900
That's enough.

00:11:41.970 --> 00:11:45.640
I'll find you another place to sing.
For now, just go and wait.

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:46.710
I have other songs.

00:11:46.710 --> 00:11:47.850
- Please give me one more chance...
- Quiet.

00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:06.460
What's your plan?

00:12:07.300 --> 00:12:10.030
Why would you go to the trouble
of having Oh Tae Pyung sing?

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:15.510
A song that doesn't suit him
in the slightest, no less.

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:19.010
Kang Hyuk, contact the head of the agency.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:22.810
Get Oh Tae Pyung a gig on some small stage
out in the boonies.

00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:24.920
That's not difficult, though.

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:28.150
I don't understand why you want
to get Oh Tae Pyung a gig...

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:31.720
You've been by my side for so long,
and you still can't figure me out?

00:12:33.490 --> 00:12:36.930
Jung Suk Hee may have the mind of a child,
but she's still alive, right?

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.760
And since she's alive,
who knows what variables might arise?

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:42.570
Whether she'll remain
an amnesiac half-wit...

00:12:42.630 --> 00:12:45.070
or get struck by lightning
and snap out of it, nobody knows.

00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.440
I see.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:49.670
So you want to use Oh Tae Pyung
to keep an eye on her.

00:12:49.870 --> 00:12:53.180
Shouldn't we create a way
to maintain contact with them?

00:12:54.180 --> 00:12:57.580
That way, if the worst should happen,
we'll be able to handle it.

00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:07.060
Chin up, Oh Tae Pyung.

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:13.430
Thanks. Tomorrow is another day.

00:13:14.330 --> 00:13:15.330
That's the spirit.

00:13:17.500 --> 00:13:18.970
You know, it's really strange.

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.740
Being at that hotel jogged my memory.

00:13:22.070 --> 00:13:23.070
About what?

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:24.510
Never mind.

00:13:27.140 --> 00:13:28.510
Could she be a doppelganger?

00:13:29.050 --> 00:13:33.150
I'm Ma Seo Rin.
I'm the Director of Food and Beverage.

00:13:33.380 --> 00:13:35.620
And when did you have time
to change your clothes?

00:13:35.620 --> 00:13:37.090
You weren't wearing your glasses earlier.

00:13:37.250 --> 00:13:38.290
What are you talking about?

00:13:38.290 --> 00:13:40.320
Get out of my way. I'm trying to work.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:43.960
There are probably a lot of look-alikes
in the world, right?

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:45.660
Where did that come from?

00:13:47.260 --> 00:13:48.500
It's just something.

00:13:49.070 --> 00:13:51.600
It's just that this one rude girl
keeps popping up.

00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:56.010
By the way, take good care of that thing
my sister asked you about, okay?

00:13:56.140 --> 00:13:57.140
Of course.

00:13:57.710 --> 00:13:59.080
Thanks for everything.

00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:02.610
I know you're busy with your law practice,
but you're helping me, and my sister too.

00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:05.650
Is "thank you" all I'm getting?

00:14:05.980 --> 00:14:08.390
You've never invited me to your place.

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:11.990
- Are you hiding a stash of gold in there?
- Alright, I understand.

00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:14.190
I'll invite you over
and treat you to a proper feast.

00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.390
- Sounds good! I get to see your sister.
- You little...

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:22.570
- So you had an ulterior motive.
- Hey, killing two birds with one stone.

00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.240
- Really?
- Yes, so when should I have him over?

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.370
That lawyer friend of yours?

00:14:29.610 --> 00:14:32.980
You're saying that lawyer
is interested in our Jang Mi?

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:37.410
Jang Mi's hand hurts.
Jang Mi has a boo-boo.

00:14:39.180 --> 00:14:42.090
He seemed really curious about her.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:45.960
We've never even met.
What's he so curious about?

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:47.660
Lawyer Kang is only interested
because of me...

00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:51.900
since you're my little sister.
Why else would he be interested in you?

00:14:52.360 --> 00:14:53.900
I guess so,

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.870
but don't you think it might be
because we spoke on the phone a few times?

00:14:57.940 --> 00:15:00.300
Right. Jang Mi has a point.

00:15:00.740 --> 00:15:05.580
Jang Mi has a voice like a songbird.
Plus, she's sweet and refined.

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:10.950
Anyone who talks to her on the phone
is bound to be charmed by her.

00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.280
But is he handsome?

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:18.460
No, wait, what's he like as a person?
What matters most is that he's a good man.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:19.520
He has to be kind.

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:22.690
Come on, Dad. Are you trying to find me
a husband or something?

00:15:23.290 --> 00:15:26.300
Come on. You're all getting way ahead
of yourselves.

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:30.130
Dad, he's a lawyer.
Are we even in his league?

00:15:30.770 --> 00:15:33.200
Jang Mi, don't you
get your hopes up, either.

00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:37.740
You're the one getting ahead of yourself.
Who said I was getting my hopes up?

00:15:38.510 --> 00:15:41.280
When did you say you were
inviting the lawyer over?

00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:42.650
Tell me.

00:15:44.680 --> 00:15:46.750
Mom, is Dad still not home?

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:50.720
I know. For some reason,
your dad has been late every day.

00:15:51.490 --> 00:15:52.590
Is he having an affair or something?

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:54.860
Kang Baek Ho.

00:15:55.390 --> 00:15:57.190
Don't be ridiculous.

00:15:58.130 --> 00:16:02.900
Your father would be the last man in Korea
to have an affair.

00:16:03.030 --> 00:16:06.800
Come on, Mom. How can you be so sure?
Dad is still a man, you know.

00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:09.710
If I don't know your father, who does?

00:16:10.340 --> 00:16:12.340
With that germaphobia of his...

00:16:12.640 --> 00:16:14.480
He's too timid to ever cheat.

00:16:16.010 --> 00:16:17.010
And besides,

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:19.880
why on earth would your father
ever betray me?

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:23.390
Your dad only has eyes for me.

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:28.330
Okay. I know how much Dad loves you.

00:16:40.570 --> 00:16:41.570
Thank you...

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:43.370
for letting me cry.

00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:50.080
I've always seen you
as a glamorous and untouchable icon.

00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:52.780
And now...

00:16:53.650 --> 00:16:55.350
you're my icon.

00:16:56.620 --> 00:16:57.620
Excuse me?

00:16:59.420 --> 00:17:01.060
Because you understood how I feel.

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:28.950
Surely Father...

00:17:29.550 --> 00:17:31.920
wouldn't bring Yeom San Wol home,
would he?

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:34.760
No, that's absolutely out of the question.

00:17:35.690 --> 00:17:37.260
Mom, aren't you going to eat?

00:17:40.530 --> 00:17:41.530
Father.

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:44.770
What if we expedited the process
of making Seo Rin the successor?

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:47.270
I thought you said I couldn't
until I showed some results.

00:17:47.340 --> 00:17:51.340
If you take Seo Rin
to meet the directors...

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:54.650
and help her make an impression,
it'll be a much faster process.

00:17:55.010 --> 00:17:59.220
- It clearly shows you approve of Seo Rin.
- I'm in.

00:17:59.650 --> 00:18:01.990
At least it's not boring with you,
Grandpa.

00:18:02.220 --> 00:18:05.160
You little rascal,
do you just come to work to see me?

00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:08.630
It's no fun. Everyone is so incompetent.

00:18:08.690 --> 00:18:09.860
Incompetent? What do you mean?

00:18:10.730 --> 00:18:13.930
They should just get to the point,
but they always beat around the bush.

00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.200
It's so frustrating I could scream.

00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:21.510
Excuse me.

00:18:21.970 --> 00:18:23.010
Yes, miss?

00:18:24.270 --> 00:18:27.140
Where are the eyeballs?
Where did the eyeballs go?

00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.880
They removed the eyeballs
at the market for me.

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:32.550
I've lost my appetite.

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:37.590
- Without eyeballs, I don't want to eat.
- Goodness, you like the eyeballs so much?

00:18:37.860 --> 00:18:38.960
This won't do.

00:18:38.960 --> 00:18:42.260
Go to the fish market
and gather up every eyeball you can find,

00:18:42.590 --> 00:18:43.960
and make some porridge for her.

00:18:44.290 --> 00:18:46.760
Would there be a place
that only sells fish eyeballs?

00:18:48.130 --> 00:18:50.130
Yes, sir. I'll look into it.

00:19:04.750 --> 00:19:06.980
Assistant Manager Jin Hong Ju's
transfer notice has been posted.

00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:13.720
Is it true?

00:19:13.990 --> 00:19:16.360
Did the Chairman really give CEO Chae
a piece of his mind?

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:17.530
He sure did.

00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:20.900
So what if Hwa Young tried to warn me?

00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:22.830
The Chairman ignored her...

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:26.340
and told me to come home. What can she do?

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:29.970
She'll just have to suck it up.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:35.480
So, Mom, stop cowering
every time CEO Chae says something to you,

00:19:35.580 --> 00:19:37.350
you need to tighten the reins on her.

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:41.890
All right, I get it.
I have nothing to lose now.

00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:45.060
Here, have some of this.

00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:51.190
And make sure to put in a good word for me
with the Chairman.

00:19:51.500 --> 00:19:54.930
I'm doing all the real work at the hotel.
Why am I still just an assistant manager?

00:19:58.740 --> 00:19:59.900
(Effective October 6, 2025,
Assistant Manager Jin Hong Ju...)

00:19:59.970 --> 00:20:01.070
(transferred to the branch
in New Delhi, India)

00:20:02.970 --> 00:20:04.070
This is ridiculous.

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:05.980
Mom.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.480
What is it?

00:20:09.550 --> 00:20:12.880
Oh my godness.
What is this outrageous nonsense?

00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:17.350
They're sending you to India,
of all places.

00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:20.720
Has Hwa Young lost her mind?
Is she insane?

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.690
Does she really think
I'll just go quietly?

00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:25.600
I'm not going. No way.

00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:29.530
It looks like Hwa Young
still doesn't get the picture,

00:20:29.900 --> 00:20:34.710
she's completely clueless about
how much the Chairman favors me.

00:20:34.770 --> 00:20:37.170
That's why she'd pull a disloyal stunt
like this.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:39.410
I'm going to teach her a lesson.

00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:54.830
Have some tea, Assistant Manager Jin.

00:20:55.360 --> 00:20:58.300
It's a Darjeeling I've been saving
for a special occasion.

00:20:58.500 --> 00:20:59.530
It's from India.

00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:02.770
I cannot accept this, ma'am.

00:21:03.470 --> 00:21:05.240
Why India all of a sudden?

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:08.810
- What am I supposed to do in India?
- What do you mean?

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:12.380
You know how huge India's population is,
don't you?

00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.310
- Do some market research...
- Ma'am.

00:21:17.450 --> 00:21:18.780
That's rich, Assistant Manager Jin.

00:21:19.480 --> 00:21:22.790
You were thrilled about the US training.
So what's wrong with India?

00:21:23.090 --> 00:21:24.890
Why are you making such a fuss about it?

00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:29.090
Technically, it was the Chairman
who sent me for that training, not you.

00:21:29.090 --> 00:21:31.630
So you're refusing to go to India?

00:21:33.700 --> 00:21:34.700
Ma'am...

00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:36.770
Listen to me carefully.

00:21:37.730 --> 00:21:39.500
I'm transferring you to India...

00:21:40.070 --> 00:21:43.270
so you can go to a larger market,
broaden your horizons,

00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:46.110
and gain more experience.
I'm giving you an opportunity.

00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:48.280
And the board of directors agrees.

00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:53.980
It's a waste to let a talent like you
rot away in one place.

00:21:57.290 --> 00:22:00.560
Don't give it a second thought.
Just hand over your duties by month's end.

00:22:01.020 --> 00:22:02.490
And get ready to leave for India.

00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:06.700
I'll have to think about it.

00:22:19.780 --> 00:22:20.840
Jung Suk Hee.

00:22:21.950 --> 00:22:24.350
Now, you just need to stay quiet,
just like you are now,

00:22:24.950 --> 00:22:26.980
and remain a half-wit forever.

00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:29.050
Got it?

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:35.730
You'll approve the banner?

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:38.800
Thank you so much.

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:39.900
Okay.

00:22:40.730 --> 00:22:41.770
Dad!

00:22:42.070 --> 00:22:44.840
The county office
just approved the banner.

00:22:44.840 --> 00:22:47.900
That's a relief. That's great news.

00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:52.380
Dad, Jang Mi! I finally got a job!

00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:54.540
What? Where?

00:22:54.610 --> 00:22:57.710
It's not a prime venue,
but I finally get to perform on stage.

00:22:58.520 --> 00:22:59.550
Really?

00:22:59.850 --> 00:23:02.190
Who on earth hired you?

00:23:02.890 --> 00:23:04.790
I passed an audition.

00:23:05.060 --> 00:23:08.760
Dream Hotel's CEO was moved by my singing
and set it up for me.

00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:12.260
Tae Pyung said he'd buy a gift
for Ok Hee and Tok Hee.

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:14.870
Is that for real?

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:18.670
Just don't get scammed this time.
I'm worried you won't really get on stage.

00:23:18.740 --> 00:23:22.340
- Dad, don't be such a killjoy.
- He's right, Dad.

00:23:22.910 --> 00:23:24.710
Tae Pyung, good luck!
I'm so happy for you!

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:28.680
But wait,
Dream Hotel's CEO was moved by your song?

00:23:29.450 --> 00:23:32.280
Am I really supposed to believe that?

00:23:34.790 --> 00:23:37.920
- Jang Mi, you've become bold.
- Anyway, congratulations.

00:23:38.560 --> 00:23:40.320
- You can do it.
- I've got this.

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.910
- Rookie.
- Yes, Chef.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:58.640
Eat it.

00:23:59.840 --> 00:24:01.650
- Excuse me?
- I said, eat it.

00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:14.760
How is it?

00:24:16.530 --> 00:24:18.900
- It's delicious.
- Delicious?

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:22.330
So pasta covered in dish soap
tastes good to you?

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.370
You're fired. Get out.

00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:28.210
I'm sorry, sir.
It will never happen again.

00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:31.210
A mistake?
You don't even have the basics down.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.840
Got it? Now get out!

00:24:34.440 --> 00:24:35.710
Didn't I tell you to get out?

00:24:36.250 --> 00:24:37.280
What's going on here?

00:24:38.850 --> 00:24:41.520
Our customers pay good money
to come to this restaurant,

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:43.850
so shouldn't we give them
their money's worth?

00:24:44.390 --> 00:24:48.790
- Everyone, get back to cooking.
- Are you really firing her?

00:24:49.130 --> 00:24:50.230
Didn't you hear me?

00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:53.760
Won't we be short-handed if you fire her?

00:24:54.360 --> 00:24:57.000
You have to think about the strain
it'll put on the other chefs.

00:24:58.600 --> 00:24:59.600
Ma'am.

00:25:00.570 --> 00:25:01.910
This is my kitchen.

00:25:03.270 --> 00:25:05.780
So, you want me to mind my own business?

00:25:07.210 --> 00:25:08.250
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

00:25:09.550 --> 00:25:11.010
I'm here as a customer.

00:25:11.950 --> 00:25:14.350
I'm hungry.
Is my food coming out any time soon?

00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:16.320
Running things like this,

00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:19.590
I'm extremely concerned...

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:21.320
about how you're going to meet
my two-month sales target.

00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:36.570
Here, a present for you.

00:25:37.570 --> 00:25:39.610
It's got a bit of a story,
which is why it's late.

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:42.380
This looks expensive!

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:45.420
I don't know what the story is,
but thanks, Baek Ho.

00:25:47.580 --> 00:25:49.550
So, is she your mother?

00:25:51.150 --> 00:25:52.290
Right.

00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:54.190
You've never met my mom before, have you?

00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:56.590
That's why I've been hesitant
to invite friends over.

00:25:57.330 --> 00:25:58.630
Really?

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:01.970
If my mom hadn't gotten injured,
she could've been your senior.

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:06.470
- My senior?
- My mom passed part one of the bar exam,

00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:11.010
but she was in an accident
before she could take the second part.

00:26:16.010 --> 00:26:19.280
So she's got beauty and brains?

00:26:19.550 --> 00:26:22.490
- Hey, your sister must be gorgeous then.
- Why you...

00:26:22.650 --> 00:26:23.890
Jang Mi is pretty.

00:26:24.650 --> 00:26:26.020
Tae Pyung is nice.

00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:27.960
Jang Mi is pretty.

00:26:29.990 --> 00:26:33.930
Huh? This is the bathhouse for my bunny.

00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:36.270
What do you mean?

00:26:36.630 --> 00:26:38.640
Mom, this is my guitar.

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:43.910
- No, Jang Mi gave this to me. It's mine.
- No, Mom.

00:26:44.670 --> 00:26:46.880
- Mom, wait.
- It's mine.

00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:50.650
My bunny's bathhouse.

00:26:58.690 --> 00:27:00.990
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:03.330
(CEO's Office)

00:27:08.230 --> 00:27:10.600
- They've put the banner back up.
- What?

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:14.100
And it looks like they got a permit
from the district office this time.

00:27:14.770 --> 00:27:15.770
Those low-lives...

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:20.410
See? What did I tell you?
They're relentless.

00:27:21.710 --> 00:27:24.780
That's the thing about these low-lives.
They just won't give up.

00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.020
What are your orders?
Should I have it taken down?

00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.120
Why are you even asking?
Tell them to tear it down!

00:27:36.460 --> 00:27:37.530
Hello, Ssangkal.

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:39.660
Tear down that banner
without anyone seeing you.

00:27:40.430 --> 00:27:41.870
And be careful not to get caught.

00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:56.280
I wonder what Lawyer Kang looks like.

00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:02.150
He's here.

00:28:02.150 --> 00:28:03.990
- Come on in.
- Oh my gosh, what do I do?

00:28:04.150 --> 00:28:05.560
Make yourself at home.

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:11.230
Hello, it's a pleasure to meet you.
My name is Kang Baek Ho...

00:28:12.130 --> 00:28:13.360
Welcome.

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:15.070
What?

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:16.400
You!

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:38.020
(The First Man)

00:28:38.090 --> 00:28:39.920
I'll have them removed
by the end of today.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.060
They just won't quit.

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:43.430
That's why we have to rip them out
by the roots.

00:28:43.660 --> 00:28:46.830
Lawyer Kang, we need to talk.

00:28:46.830 --> 00:28:49.470
I only kept quiet
to save you the embarrassment.

00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:52.400
Do you think I'd choose my love
over my own daughter?

00:28:52.470 --> 00:28:55.770
- You're in love with the Chairman?
- I love the Chairman!

00:28:56.570 --> 00:28:57.570
Enough.

00:29:01.950 --> 00:29:03.950
