00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.610
(Solha OB-GYN)

00:00:01.610 --> 00:00:03.740
(Episode 2)

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.320
Just a little more. Keep pushing.

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:24.800
All right, push just a little more.

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.680
My baby...

00:00:39.910 --> 00:00:40.980
It's a boy, right?

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:44.950
Why...

00:00:46.620 --> 00:00:48.190
is it so quiet?

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:52.760
Why can't I hear my baby crying?

00:00:58.060 --> 00:00:59.300
I'm afraid...

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:03.200
Afraid of what?

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:05.940
What do you mean, you're afraid?

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:08.640
The baby had already passed away.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:10.740
What?

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.210
So you're telling me
I gave birth to a dead baby?

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:18.820
- Is that what you're saying?
- By the time you arrived at the hospital,

00:01:19.380 --> 00:01:21.350
the baby had already passed away.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.790
No. That's impossible.

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.300
Bring him back.

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.170
Bring him back! I said, bring him back!

00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:38.470
No!

00:01:39.940 --> 00:01:43.070
No! Bring back my son!

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:45.740
Hwa Young.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.320
No! It can't be!

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:54.250
Bring my son back!

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:59.090
No! My son!

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:00.890
Bring him back!

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.100
Fine.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.970
After I have this baby,

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:10.670
I will prove without a doubt
that he is Dong Seok's child.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:14.840
If she's that adamant about it,

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.480
she's pregnant with Dong Seok's child.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.580
She wouldn't be so confident otherwise.

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:24.650
Chae Hwa Young.

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:29.090
- When is she due?
- In two months, I believe.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.820
Two months?

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:33.630
How am I supposed to wait that long?

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:37.400
That child will take Dong Seok's place.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.630
My entire fortune
and Dream Department Store.

00:02:41.630 --> 00:02:43.300
I'm giving it all to him.

00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.640
Yes, sir.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.310
I can't wait to meet the baby.

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:50.210
Oh, right.

00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.610
Where did you say
Chae Hwa Young is staying?

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.550
I believe she lives in a villa
in Hangang-gu.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:57.820
What do you mean, "you believe?"

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:02.350
The baby is the precious grandson
who will lead Dream Department Store.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.590
Shouldn't you know exactly where she is
and how she's doing?

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:08.830
- I'm sorry, sir.
- She needs to eat well for the baby.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.660
Go send her some ribs or something.

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:14.730
I suppose it's time
I started acting like a grandfather.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.730
You need to eat something.

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.000
If you don't eat after giving birth,
you'll waste away.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.170
I made you some seaweed soup.

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:48.430
Shut it!

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.930
What are you talking about,
"giving birth?"

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:51.340
Watch your mouth.

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.770
My son is still here.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:57.180
He's still right here,
so watch your mouth.

00:03:58.010 --> 00:03:59.040
My baby can hear you.

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:02.710
All right.

00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:04.980
All right.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.450
It's time to let it go.

00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:10.420
- It's already over.
- Kang Hyuk.

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.290
How am I supposed to live now?

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:17.300
I have no hope left.

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:20.630
What do you mean, no hope?
Just go back to how you lived before.

00:04:20.970 --> 00:04:23.300
Go back to acting.
You're a huge star, aren't you?

00:04:24.770 --> 00:04:26.400
You need to pull yourself together
and move on.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:28.940
- Like before.
- Before?

00:04:30.510 --> 00:04:32.440
Sucking up to those arrogant elites,

00:04:33.380 --> 00:04:36.650
living like a fish on a cutting board
with my life in their hands,

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:40.180
always having to be chosen
just to survive?

00:04:41.590 --> 00:04:43.090
You're telling me
I have to go back to that?

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.020
You're famous enough
that you don't have to grovel anymore.

00:04:47.090 --> 00:04:49.130
- Besides, you have me.
- No.

00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:51.760
I didn't want to be the one
getting chosen.

00:04:52.360 --> 00:04:54.700
I wanted to be the one
who does the choosing.

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.970
I wanted to be on top, calling the shots,
giving the approvals,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.140
and have everyone...

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:02.670
kneel before me.

00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.480
No matter what it takes,

00:05:07.550 --> 00:05:09.810
I have to get Dream Group
in the palm of my hand.

00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:12.920
Chairman Ma isn't going to live forever,

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:17.160
and my child has to be his heir
so I can be the one in charge.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:20.430
But look at this mess.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.830
Everything's fallen apart
right from the start.

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:28.200
It's all her fault.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:33.140
Because of that wench, Jung Suk Hee,
all my dreams and hopes...

00:05:34.110 --> 00:05:36.370
have all gone up in smoke.

00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:47.950
Ok Hee. Tok Hee.

00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:51.560
I know it's tough,
but just hang in there a little longer.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:55.790
Once you're born
and you're a little bigger,

00:05:56.590 --> 00:06:00.470
Mommy's going to study for the bar again
and become a judge.

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.640
Then I'll make sure
you never have to struggle.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:19.520
If I'd known sooner
that Dong Seok went abroad,

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:21.890
I wouldn't have had to hide anymore,

00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:24.490
and I could've taken the second round
of the bar exam.

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:39.100
That's it.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:42.070
Now that it's come to this,
Jung Suk Hee...

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.310
- What?
- That wench, Jung Suk Hee.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:57.820
Is she carrying Dong Seok's baby?

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:08.100
I'll just have to take
Jung Suk Hee's baby.

00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:10.600
What?

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:13.840
My baby died because of that wench!

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:16.770
The one who killed my son
was that wench, Jung Suk Hee!

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.940
So it's only right that I take her baby.

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:21.310
It's only fair, isn't it?

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.320
- Chae Hwa Young.
- That's right.

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:27.080
All I have to do is take the baby
Jung Suk Hee gives birth to.

00:07:28.450 --> 00:07:30.020
If that baby is Dong Seok's,

00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:32.960
I can easily fool Chairman Ma.

00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:36.530
Kang Hyuk, give me the seaweed soup now.

00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:38.260
I want to eat. I'm hungry.

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:39.830
Hurry!

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:47.370
Ok Hee. Tok Hee.

00:07:48.170 --> 00:07:52.710
Mommy hasn't taken good care of you,
so I'll at least sing you a lullaby.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:08:02.550
When Mommy's in the island's shade

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:09.660
Gathering oysters from the sea

00:08:10.660 --> 00:08:16.570
Baby is left all alone

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.780
Ms. Chae Hwa Young,
I'm here on behalf of Chairman Ma.

00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:29.750
Kang Hyuk!

00:08:31.750 --> 00:08:32.950
Quick, get this out of sight.

00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:35.050
Looks like Chairman Ma's secretary
is here.

00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:37.460
What do I do?

00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:39.560
Hold on.

00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:05.080
Good afternoon, ma'am.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:07.250
Ma'am?

00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.520
Welcome. But what brings you here?

00:09:10.760 --> 00:09:13.120
The chairman wants to know
how you are doing.

00:09:13.490 --> 00:09:15.930
- I trust you're well?
- Can't you see for yourself?

00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:19.730
Tell him not to worry.
Our baby is growing very well.

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:23.970
Once I've given birth to the baby,
I'll walk in proudly with my child,

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:27.070
and then you people can run a test
to confirm that it's Dong Seok's baby.

00:09:27.070 --> 00:09:31.040
It's not that.
The chairman is eager to see his grandson.

00:09:32.180 --> 00:09:33.380
If you give him a grandson,

00:09:33.610 --> 00:09:35.750
he'll give you everything
including the department store.

00:09:36.080 --> 00:09:37.320
He made that very clear.

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.250
Is that really true?

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:43.620
Yes. He said he wants
to be a real grandfather.

00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:45.820
He also said to let him know
if you need anything at all.

00:09:46.990 --> 00:09:49.590
That won't be necessary.
I can take care of my own child.

00:09:49.660 --> 00:09:50.760
So tell him to wait.

00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.680
Is he gone?
He didn't suspect anything, did he?

00:10:12.950 --> 00:10:13.950
No.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.090
I have to come up with a plan.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:22.360
How can I possibly take
Jung Suk Hee's baby?

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:23.860
Hwa Young.

00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.730
- Do you really have to do this?
- You heard him.

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:30.840
Chairman Ma said
he'd give my child everything.

00:10:31.840 --> 00:10:33.800
No matter what,
it has to be Jung Suk Hee's baby.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:35.740
That sly old fox...

00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.540
would know in a second
if the baby is not Dong Seok's.

00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:42.050
That's why it absolutely has to be
Jung Suk Hee's baby.

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:44.580
Hwa Young.

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:46.620
If you're really set on this,

00:10:48.950 --> 00:10:50.090
I'll do it.

00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.720
You shouldn't get your hands dirty.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.960
You'd do that for me?

00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:04.170
Kang Hyuk.

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:06.800
If this is what makes you happy,
then that's all that matters.

00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:09.940
When you're happy, I'm happy.

00:11:11.740 --> 00:11:12.780
Kang Hyuk.

00:11:34.330 --> 00:11:37.300
What? What do you mean by that?

00:11:37.970 --> 00:11:39.400
What do you mean I'm fired?

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:43.270
- Ma'am.
- Don't call me heartless.

00:11:43.570 --> 00:11:46.480
Who wants to see you waddling around
with a belly that big?

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:48.750
Still, ma'am...

00:11:49.710 --> 00:11:52.550
I need this money to raise my baby.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:56.190
That's not my problem.
You're due any day now.

00:11:56.190 --> 00:11:58.860
- You should quit right now.
- But it's so sudden.

00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:02.060
I honestly have nowhere to go.

00:12:02.530 --> 00:12:05.630
Ma'am, please cut me some slack.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:09.070
I only let you stay this long
because you kept begging.

00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:10.840
I've heard enough. Just pack your things.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.300
Ma'am, please.

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:31.090
It's okay.

00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.860
Ok Hee. Tok Hee.

00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:35.030
You trust Mommy, right?

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:38.530
I'll never let you go hungry.

00:12:46.100 --> 00:12:47.440
Here, please take one.

00:12:49.710 --> 00:12:52.640
"Room and board. Mature women welcome."

00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:57.110
"Seeking a live-in caretaker
for an elderly woman at her villa."

00:12:57.280 --> 00:13:00.890
"Salary negotiable.
Having a young child is okay?"

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.620
And they welcome mature women.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:05.190
Plus room and board?

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:10.830
This is practically made for me.
This is a godsend.

00:13:19.670 --> 00:13:20.740
Jung Suk Hee.

00:13:21.810 --> 00:13:23.240
Enjoy it while it lasts.

00:13:24.110 --> 00:13:27.810
You have no idea what a thorny path
lies ahead of you.

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:29.650
That's right.

00:13:29.950 --> 00:13:32.280
Your mission is
to have that baby safely...

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.520
and put it in my arms. Mark my words.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.800
(Resume
Name: Jung Suk Hee)

00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:51.800
Well...

00:13:52.770 --> 00:13:54.910
I've already moved out of my place.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:59.010
I'm sorry,
but I have nowhere to go back to.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:02.380
- So...
- Are you threatening me to hire you?

00:14:04.050 --> 00:14:07.320
Yes, I'll take excellent care of you,

00:14:07.590 --> 00:14:10.090
and I'm a very efficient housekeeper.

00:14:10.090 --> 00:14:11.490
On top of that,

00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:14.060
I am an amazing cook.

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:16.290
Cook?

00:14:17.330 --> 00:14:18.400
Actually,

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:21.500
I'm hiring someone because I get lonely.

00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:23.730
So, when are you due?

00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.340
I still have a little while.

00:14:27.970 --> 00:14:29.540
You don't need to worry.

00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:32.210
I'll make sure not to be a burden
on you in any way.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.210
I'll work my very hardest.

00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:36.250
But...

00:14:36.650 --> 00:14:38.420
I am a little worried
the hospital is so far away.

00:14:39.280 --> 00:14:41.350
Does that mean...

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:45.020
I got the job? Is that what you're saying?

00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:47.320
I get lonely,
so having a baby around would be nice.

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.030
A little living doll.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.000
Imagine how lovely that would be.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:55.630
Thank you so much.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:15:00.700
Ma'am, you're a lifesaver.
I promise I'll take the best care of you.

00:15:16.020 --> 00:15:17.020
So, how did it go?

00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.890
- I told her she could start today.
- And her due date?

00:15:19.890 --> 00:15:21.060
She said it's in about a month.

00:15:21.860 --> 00:15:23.190
One month, you say?

00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:26.630
Keep a close eye on her
and call me if anything happens.

00:15:27.230 --> 00:15:29.870
And don't let her suspect a thing. Got it?

00:15:43.810 --> 00:15:44.850
Jung Suk Hee.

00:15:45.550 --> 00:15:47.650
This is because you killed my baby.

00:15:48.450 --> 00:15:49.850
So don't you dare blame me.

00:15:50.090 --> 00:15:52.760
Actually, blame me all you want.

00:15:53.860 --> 00:15:55.390
No matter what happens,

00:15:56.030 --> 00:15:57.560
I'm taking your baby.

00:16:22.290 --> 00:16:24.050
Hey, Suk Hee!

00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:29.390
I'm sorry. I was mistaken.

00:16:29.390 --> 00:16:31.160
Sorry about that.

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:42.970
Suk Hee.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:46.040
I hope you're doing okay.

00:16:48.610 --> 00:16:51.480
I’m so pathetic
that you can’t even count on me.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:53.820
I'm so sorry, Suk Hee.

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:58.520
No news is good news, I guess.

00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:00.890
Right, Suk Hee?

00:17:08.400 --> 00:17:10.630
So you really don't have a husband,

00:17:10.830 --> 00:17:12.770
and no one's looking for you at all?

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:14.840
That's right.

00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:17.710
Actually,

00:17:18.310 --> 00:17:21.650
there's this guy I grew up with
at the orphanage,

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.850
but I haven't even told him
that I'm pregnant.

00:17:25.250 --> 00:17:27.080
Bok Gil has got enough on his plate,

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:31.720
so what good would come
from telling him I'm pregnant?

00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.130
He'd just worry himself sick.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.270
Gosh, this really hits the spot.

00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.240
- You made this just right.
- Does it suit your palate?

00:17:55.410 --> 00:17:56.450
Bok Gil.

00:17:57.380 --> 00:17:59.180
I know you must be worried about me.

00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.750
But I'm doing just fine here,

00:18:03.190 --> 00:18:04.460
so don't you worry about me.

00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.990
I hope Tae Sook and Tae Pyung
are doing well.

00:18:08.830 --> 00:18:10.930
I feel like I've always been
a burden to you,

00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.660
but I'll find a way to repay you someday.

00:18:14.330 --> 00:18:15.600
Take care, Bok Gil.

00:18:15.830 --> 00:18:16.870
A while back,

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:20.040
you said you'd met someone special.
What happened with that?

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:21.670
And you're not planning
on getting married?

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:23.970
(Muho Villa, 154-2 Muho-ri, Gojang-myeon,
South Chungcheong Province)

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:25.180
(Jung Suk Hee)

00:18:25.340 --> 00:18:28.050
Is she at a villa studying
for the second round of the bar exam?

00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:54.810
Now that I'm all settled in,

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.980
I should find a hospital
for my Ok Hee and Tok Hee's arrival.

00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:08.850
Judging by the size of her belly,
it's definitely a boy.

00:19:09.820 --> 00:19:13.220
First babies can be late,
but I'd say she has two weeks, tops.

00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:14.490
Ma'am?

00:19:16.630 --> 00:19:19.700
Two weeks? Two weeks is too long.
I don't have that kind of time.

00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.800
- Do you have any idea what I'm saying?
- Oh, for crying out loud.

00:19:26.270 --> 00:19:29.840
Do I get sick on your schedule?
Just come by within a few days.

00:19:32.880 --> 00:19:35.410
Ma'am, who was that?

00:19:35.650 --> 00:19:37.380
My primary nurse. She's such a brat.

00:19:37.650 --> 00:19:39.350
She said she's coming
to check my blood pressure,

00:19:39.850 --> 00:19:41.850
so you should get a checkup
while she's here.

00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:44.120
Really?

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:48.430
Ma'am, thank you.

00:19:49.430 --> 00:19:51.400
I may not have been lucky with parents,

00:19:52.030 --> 00:19:54.030
but I've been so blessed
with the people I've met.

00:20:06.940 --> 00:20:08.010
Right. Two weeks.

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:10.580
I can end this in two weeks.

00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:14.750
Who is it now? I can't be bothered.

00:20:15.320 --> 00:20:16.490
Who is it?

00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.020
The chairman is here.

00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:21.290
The chairman? Oh, no.

00:20:21.430 --> 00:20:22.660
Just a minute.

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:24.660
Just a second!

00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:28.130
My belly...

00:20:34.610 --> 00:20:36.240
What's taking so long? Open the door!

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.640
Yes, I'm coming!

00:20:37.640 --> 00:20:38.780
Oh, good grief!

00:20:39.210 --> 00:20:40.280
Darn it.

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:43.780
Oh, gosh. Seriously.

00:20:44.380 --> 00:20:45.380
This is insane.

00:20:47.550 --> 00:20:49.420
I can't believe it!

00:21:20.550 --> 00:21:23.290
Am I interrupting something?

00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:24.920
No, not at all.

00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.660
It's just I've been cooped up
at home lately, so I'm a mess.

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:32.760
You really shouldn't have.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.400
Thank you, Father.

00:21:39.170 --> 00:21:40.300
Please have a seat.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.450
Oh, gosh.

00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:08.570
Bok Gil must be worried about me by now.

00:22:19.110 --> 00:22:20.110
What?

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:23.150
What?

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.620
Why is this cut?

00:22:28.050 --> 00:22:29.850
Should I ask the lady?

00:22:56.350 --> 00:23:00.180
Father, this is jujube tea
I've been enjoying lately.

00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:03.390
I heard it's good for the baby.

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:05.360
I see.

00:23:09.530 --> 00:23:12.200
But I smell wine.

00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.470
Wine? That's impossible.

00:23:16.970 --> 00:23:19.940
All right, if you say so.
But it's not like you to be so tense.

00:23:23.670 --> 00:23:25.810
Oh, no. What if I get caught?

00:23:26.610 --> 00:23:28.680
That would ruin everything.

00:23:36.090 --> 00:23:37.090
Father!

00:23:37.890 --> 00:23:38.890
What is it?

00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:49.370
What's wrong?
Are your contractions starting?

00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:53.240
I don't know.
All of a sudden, my stomach...

00:23:53.600 --> 00:23:57.070
You're not due for a while yet.
Let's get you to your room for now.

00:23:58.040 --> 00:23:59.110
Up you go.

00:24:01.240 --> 00:24:02.310
There you go.

00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:07.580
You're doing great.

00:24:11.790 --> 00:24:13.690
What was so urgent?

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:17.960
My son. I'm talking about my son.

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:22.600
You haven't even had him, and you are
already going on about your son?

00:24:23.530 --> 00:24:24.530
All right.

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:28.610
Of course, once the baby is born,
we'll do a DNA test.

00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:31.780
If we're sure the baby is Dong Seok's,

00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:34.480
I'll make up...

00:24:35.310 --> 00:24:36.550
for how poorly I've treated you.

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:42.020
- Thank you, Father.
- Just focus on having a healthy baby.

00:24:43.490 --> 00:24:45.620
Now, what's this down at my feet?

00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:51.160
My phone's ringing.

00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.630
If it's ringing, you should answer.
Don't worry about me. Get it.

00:24:57.170 --> 00:24:58.200
It's fine.

00:24:58.640 --> 00:25:01.610
But Father, I really should get some rest.

00:25:01.840 --> 00:25:06.310
Right. Is that so?
Then I should be on my way.

00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:08.310
Go on, answer it.

00:25:09.010 --> 00:25:11.620
- Well, then, please excuse me.
- Sure.

00:25:13.820 --> 00:25:16.290
Come over quickly!
Her contractions have started.

00:25:20.060 --> 00:25:21.060
All right.

00:25:23.390 --> 00:25:24.900
What was that about?

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:28.200
- That was...
- "Her contractions have started?"

00:25:28.570 --> 00:25:31.900
Pardon? It's nothing important.

00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.700
It sounds like a friend of mine
is in labor.

00:25:34.940 --> 00:25:36.810
But why would they call you?

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:39.940
Are you two really that close?

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.580
But still...

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:45.820
If your friend is the one in labor,
she can't be calling.

00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.220
It's just...

00:25:48.690 --> 00:25:52.020
- Her mother called me.
- My point exactly.

00:25:52.590 --> 00:25:55.490
Why is she calling to report
to you like this?

00:25:55.990 --> 00:25:57.530
It's not like the baby is even born yet.

00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:59.530
You see...

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:03.230
I'm having my baby soon too, you know.

00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:07.100
Since it's my first and I'm inexperienced,
I asked her for a favor.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:10.070
I told her I wanted to be there
to see what it's like.

00:26:10.910 --> 00:26:14.640
I thought it would help me
prepare myself mentally.

00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:30.060
Of course.

00:26:30.130 --> 00:26:33.430
I'm clearly not ready to be a grandfather.

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:35.130
I'm not cut out for it.

00:26:36.770 --> 00:26:39.540
You've never had a baby before,
so you must be terrified.

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:41.570
And here I was, not even understanding...

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:43.270
why you'd want that secondhand experience.

00:26:43.770 --> 00:26:44.810
I'm so sorry.

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:49.980
No, it's okay.
I should go get changed then.

00:26:50.610 --> 00:26:53.150
Okay, I'll wait. Let's take my car.

00:26:53.150 --> 00:26:54.420
I'll drop you off on my way.

00:26:54.650 --> 00:26:56.790
No, you must be busy.
I don't want to hold you up.

00:26:57.250 --> 00:27:00.460
Besides, Manager Lee is waiting
for me downstairs,

00:27:01.120 --> 00:27:02.130
so I'm all set.

00:27:02.390 --> 00:27:05.030
Oh, is he? All right, then.

00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:08.930
Take care of yourself. Keep me posted.

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.670
I will. Get home safely, Father.

00:27:30.690 --> 00:27:34.190
It's way too late for the hospital.
The doctor will be here any minute.

00:27:34.390 --> 00:27:36.090
So don't waste your energy.
Just lie down and rest.

00:27:36.390 --> 00:27:37.990
I'm so sorry.

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:41.460
Don't worry about anything.
Just focus on having a smooth delivery.

00:27:41.600 --> 00:27:43.070
That's all you need to think about.

00:27:43.730 --> 00:27:44.730
Okay.

00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:50.070
What am I going to do?
Seriously, what's taking them so long?

00:27:50.610 --> 00:27:52.040
We're going to lose the mother
at this rate.

00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:54.810
My goodness, why is your belly so big?

00:27:55.110 --> 00:27:57.550
You must have a big baby in there.

00:27:58.150 --> 00:28:01.850
It's because they're twins.

00:28:02.250 --> 00:28:04.390
What? Twins?

00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:10.490
- Come in, quick!
- How long has she been in labor?

00:28:10.630 --> 00:28:13.500
- About an hour.
- Okay, let me examine her.

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:16.500
Breathe slowly.

00:28:17.270 --> 00:28:20.470
That's it. Breathe slowly.

00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:32.150
Oh, it sounds like the baby's here.

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:33.980
It's twins.

00:28:34.350 --> 00:28:38.220
- What? What do you mean?
- I'm telling you, it's twins!

00:28:38.620 --> 00:28:40.020
There's not one but two!

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:07.220
(The First Man)

00:29:07.280 --> 00:29:09.520
I only need one baby.

00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:11.690
I have to hurry. There's no time.

00:29:11.890 --> 00:29:14.820
Which baby should I take?

00:29:14.990 --> 00:29:17.690
Oh, no. This makes me your accomplice,
Hwa Young.

00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.330
That was not the nurse.
Was it Chae Hwa Young?

00:29:20.330 --> 00:29:22.530
You get rid of the other baby.

00:29:22.830 --> 00:29:24.900
This child should never have been born
into this world.

00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:26.670
Please help Mommy.

00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:28.340
The baby is alive!

00:29:31.610 --> 00:29:33.610
