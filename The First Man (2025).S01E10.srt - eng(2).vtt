00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.270
(Episode 10)

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:05.480
- I'm sorry
- I'm sorry

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:09.810
- I'm sorry to leave you behind
- I'm sorry to leave you behind

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:13.350
Those beautiful days,
those happy memories

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:15.190
- It's all over now
- It's all over now

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:17.860
You're doing great!

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.590
Mom, you look like you're having fun.

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:23.290
- In search of happiness
- In search of happiness

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.360
- In search of a dream
- In search of a dream

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:30.100
- I must go far away
- I must go far away

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:33.300
- I'm sorry
- I'm sorry

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:36.170
- I'm sorry
- I'm sorry

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:40.080
- I'm sorry to leave you behind
- I'm sorry to leave you behind

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.950
What's the matter?

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.450
"What's the matter?"

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:50.960
Did you just ask me what's going on?

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:56.360
Calm down.
You have to tell me what's going on.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:00:58.330
This whole mess is happening...

00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.630
because you didn't finish
the job properly.

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:01.930
Has Jung Suk Hee done something?

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.300
So what are you going to do now?
What are you going to do about it?

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.470
Jung Suk Hee is on her way to the villa
with her entire family.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:10.480
What? The villa?

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:12.510
Yes, the villa from 30 years ago.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:15.010
If she didn't remember something,

00:01:15.010 --> 00:01:17.520
how would her family possibly know
to go there?

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.120
Apparently, they go to the villa
where the accident happened every year,

00:01:21.250 --> 00:01:24.090
and they're trying to find out
who did that to Jung Suk Hee.

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:26.220
What are you going to do?
What will you do?

00:01:26.590 --> 00:01:28.660
I told you to do your job properly!

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.830
Hold on.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.200
Yes, it's me. Where are you?

00:02:00.260 --> 00:02:01.260
You are?

00:02:01.860 --> 00:02:03.130
So you're near Taean, then?

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.500
Keep an eye on them,

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:07.570
and call me the second something happens.

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:12.240
You said...

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.870
she regressed to a five-year-old's mind
and had amnesia,

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:15.910
so I was relieved.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:17.710
But obviously, that's not the case.

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.680
On the slim chance she goes to that villa
and her memories start coming back,

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.820
what are we going to do then?

00:02:24.120 --> 00:02:26.020
We'll be trapped, both you and me,

00:02:26.380 --> 00:02:28.490
and we won't be able to escape
the attempted murder charge.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.160
Do you have any idea
what I went through to get this far?

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:35.960
Dong Seok.
Is marrying me such a terrible thing?

00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.300
Let me be perfectly clear.

00:02:38.430 --> 00:02:40.330
I'm in love with someone else,

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:42.800
and I'm going to marry her.

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:44.270
She's pregnant too?

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.770
No way.

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.940
I absolutely cannot let Jung Suk Hee
meet with Chairman Ma.

00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:50.480
Dong Seok's child...

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:52.840
has to be my baby. Mine alone.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:55.050
All right, Jung Suk Hee.

00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:57.650
This is where you live, is it?

00:02:58.520 --> 00:02:59.550
You just wait.

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:08.660
- The baby had already...
- Bring him back.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:09.990
- passed away.
- Bring him back.

00:03:10.190 --> 00:03:11.230
Bring him back!

00:03:11.230 --> 00:03:13.260
- I said, bring him back!
- My baby died because of you.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:14.630
Because of you!

00:03:15.330 --> 00:03:17.840
No! Give me back my baby!

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:18.970
No!

00:03:19.040 --> 00:03:20.610
Jung Suk Hee, get this straight.

00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:23.370
From now on, this baby is mine.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.880
I said she's my baby now!

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.480
I'm so close.

00:03:28.510 --> 00:03:30.850
I'm so close to taking over Dream,

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.290
but that woman, Jung Suk Hee,
is trying to get in my way again.

00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:36.820
That will never happen.

00:03:37.820 --> 00:03:38.860
How can you be so sure?

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:41.360
Regression caused by an accident...

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:44.360
is a complex issue involving brain damage,
mental trauma, and neurological decline.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.460
It's extremely difficult to treat.

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.270
And you can guarantee that?

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:50.770
The only reason
they're going to the villa...

00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:53.940
is because she was found there.

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:57.880
There is absolutely no hope
of her getting better, so rest assured.

00:03:57.910 --> 00:03:58.940
No.

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:02.610
For decades, I thought she was dead,
only to get blindsided like this.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:04.980
Could you even begin to imagine that?

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.950
I can't let my guard down again.

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:09.850
You have them under surveillance, right?

00:04:10.660 --> 00:04:13.320
Yes. They'll call if anything happens.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.030
See? That's your problem.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:19.660
You'll just sit around like an idiot
and wait for something to happen!

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:24.570
I'll prevent anything from happening.

00:04:24.570 --> 00:04:26.370
I'll tighten our surveillance on them.

00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:30.510
I refuse to lose anything. Ever.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:34.250
No. I refuse to bow down to anyone.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:38.420
Chairman Ma, that old man,
doesn't have much time left.

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.760
I can't keep bowing down to him forever.

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:53.160
Putting this in the space here is nice.

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.370
It's good,

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.370
but isn't this color
a little drab over here?

00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:02.340
It needs a brighter feel.

00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:03.840
This side too.

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.050
(Seeking witnesses)

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:10.850
(Looking for anyone who knew Jung Suk Hee,
a student at the villa from 30 years ago)

00:05:15.050 --> 00:05:17.590
(Seeking witnesses)

00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.180
(Seeking witnesses)

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.990
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.590
Are you sure that headache medicine
will be enough?

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:04.740
I heard you haven't been sleeping well
because of your insomnia.

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.810
Ma'am, it's time for your meeting.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.410
Have Assistant Manager Jin
take Director Ma...

00:06:12.680 --> 00:06:14.410
to the conference room and wait for me.

00:06:19.750 --> 00:06:21.490
If by some chance things go wrong,

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:25.560
what we couldn't finish 30 years ago...

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:26.920
Don't worry. You should go.

00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:29.130
I'll finish it.

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:32.060
I'll report back
if anything urgent comes up.

00:06:44.810 --> 00:06:47.480
- Chairman, you're here.
- Where are you off to?

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:48.780
I have a meeting.

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:50.450
I'm meeting with
the Industrial Design Department...

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:52.050
to collaborate on the hotel renovation.

00:06:52.180 --> 00:06:53.790
And we have to make
a final decision today.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:56.150
I see. All right, go ahead.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.560
(CEO's Office)

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.130
(Seeking witnesses)

00:07:11.970 --> 00:07:14.340
(Looking for anyone who knew Jung Suk Hee,
a student at the villa from 30 years ago)

00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:25.650
Yes, it's me.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.550
Find out if anyone calls in a tip
about that banner.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.860
And don't let your guard down.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.130
I've checked the lounge bar,

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:37.400
and the break areas should be fine
as you proposed.

00:07:39.030 --> 00:07:41.200
The rest of the renovations can proceed.

00:07:41.470 --> 00:07:42.730
Now, that just leaves the logo.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.900
Between Option A and Option B
that you proposed, Professor,

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:48.670
we've had several meetings,
but we just can't decide.

00:07:49.010 --> 00:07:52.610
Professor, which design do you think
would be a better fit for our hotel?

00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:56.110
A logo is a company's symbol.

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:59.180
It's a visual representation
of the hotel's identity.

00:08:03.890 --> 00:08:05.390
I poured my heart and soul
into these designs.

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.530
So whichever you choose,
you'll be making the right decision.

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:11.130
Gosh, how boring.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.930
A cliche question gets a generic answer.

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:18.770
- Director Ma.
- Right, Assistant Manager Jin?

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:22.540
Maybe you should try asking
a less cliche question.

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:23.940
What? Cliche?

00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:27.880
What would a freeloader like you know?

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:34.790
Then why don't you enlighten us
with a clever question, Director Ma?

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:39.890
What is wrong with you two?
The professor is right here.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.360
Professor.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:44.560
Which logo is...

00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:47.270
going to make our Dream Hotel
a boatload of money?

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:52.070
- Pardon?
- Which logo will bring in more business?

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.470
That's what I'm asking.

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.010
My daughter lived abroad for a long time,
so her Korean isn't very polished.

00:08:56.270 --> 00:08:58.680
She can be a little blunt.
I hope you'll understand.

00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:02.850
It may be blunt,
but it's a valid question.

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:05.480
Option A...

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:09.650
was designed to convey
a sense of luxury and trust,

00:09:10.050 --> 00:09:14.690
while Option B is designed based on
the hotel's warmth and comfort.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:17.660
In that case, we should go with Option A.

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:22.300
The guests who come to Dream Hotel
want to escape their ordinary lives...

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.200
for a brief moment of luxury.

00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:32.480
See?

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:36.610
You have to ask the right question
to get the right answer.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.390
I wonder why that CEO
is so interested in our family.

00:09:46.890 --> 00:09:50.330
I told her about our happy little family,
and she said she'd be in touch.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.530
I thought she called you
so she'd invest in your album.

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:53.800
Yes, that's what she said.

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:58.770
But I guess since our family
isn't well-off,

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:01.010
it seemed like she was
just sounding me out...

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:02.110
to see if she could get anything from us.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:03.910
No, I doubt that's it.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:06.940
What do family finances
have to do with singing?

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.880
I wonder if there's another reason.

00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:12.480
So,

00:10:13.150 --> 00:10:15.290
what happened to that guitar
you promised me?

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.790
About that...

00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:23.060
This awful woman just snatched my guitar
for no reason, and...

00:10:23.330 --> 00:10:24.330
And?

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:28.070
- She totally smashed it.
- What? She smashed it?

00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:30.500
Gosh, that's unbelievable!

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:33.040
I know, right? It's totally insane.

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.070
What kind of girl does that
and then just throws 100 dollars at me,

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:37.610
trying to wash her hands
of the whole thing?

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:40.240
I've never met anyone
so shameless in my life.

00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:44.050
- Hey, that guitar was worth...
- Kang Baek Ho. Lawyer Kang.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.820
Hey, are you making this story up?

00:10:48.350 --> 00:10:49.390
You don't have to get me one.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.860
It's the thought that counts.

00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.860
What? But it's the truth!

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:54.830
Hey, you don't believe me?

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:18.580
Mom, does anything feel familiar?

00:11:18.820 --> 00:11:22.390
That's right, Suk Hee.
Anything at all. It's okay, just tell us.

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:54.320
Let's go into the woods.

00:11:57.620 --> 00:11:58.660
Why there?

00:11:59.790 --> 00:12:01.130
I want some gimbap.

00:12:01.190 --> 00:12:03.290
Suk Hee wants gimbap.

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:05.660
Let's go, Jang Mi.

00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:07.830
Let's go there, Bok Gil.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:10.400
All right, let's go.

00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:12.840
Goodness.

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:14.510
But, Jang Mi.

00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:16.840
Your exam is coming up soon.

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:18.840
Should you be spending time like this?

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.150
It's okay, Dad.

00:12:21.150 --> 00:12:24.350
I've been practicing
whenever I have a spare moment.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:25.850
All right, let's go.

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:28.050
- Let's go!
- Come.

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:32.220
All right, a little picnic then.

00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:37.030
You don't need to worry.

00:12:37.700 --> 00:12:39.430
That was a full 30 years ago.

00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:40.560
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:42.330
No one will see this and contact them.

00:12:44.370 --> 00:12:45.370
And so?

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:48.870
They ate gimbap near the villa and left?
Is that what you're telling me?

00:12:49.610 --> 00:12:51.910
- That's correct.
- Your complacency is the problem.

00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:55.250
No one will contact them
because it was 30 years ago?

00:12:55.580 --> 00:12:58.520
Jung Suk Hee's family is still trying
to dig up something that happened...

00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:01.020
a full 30 years ago without giving up.

00:13:01.190 --> 00:13:02.820
And you're telling me not to worry?

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:05.890
Those people haven't given up,
and you're telling me not to worry?

00:13:06.890 --> 00:13:07.890
I apologize.

00:13:08.430 --> 00:13:10.030
I won't make another mistake.

00:13:10.030 --> 00:13:11.160
In your vocabulary,

00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:13.960
the word "mistake" shouldn't even exist.

00:13:14.570 --> 00:13:15.570
Got it?

00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:32.950
Numbers 16 through 30, please enter.

00:13:33.650 --> 00:13:34.650
Yes.

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:39.490
(Artisan rice bread bakery,
made with our rice)

00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:47.400
All right.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:49.700
You have to pass this culinary exam,
Oh Jang Mi.

00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:53.170
That's the only way I can become
Chef Kang Jun Ho's apprentice.

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:54.870
I can do this!

00:14:08.750 --> 00:14:10.490
Italian meat sauce...

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.290
and a BLT sandwich.

00:14:26.340 --> 00:14:28.710
Everyone, take one step back
and put your hands behind your back.

00:14:37.250 --> 00:14:38.250
Begin.

00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:49.230
(National Culinary Arts Certification,
Practical Exam)

00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:22.330
It said, "All ingredients must be minced,"
right?

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:52.160
Submit at least 150ml of sauce,

00:15:52.960 --> 00:15:55.530
and garnish with minced parsley.

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:21.150
Dad, I heard the pass rate
for Jang Mi's exam is only 30 percent.

00:16:21.990 --> 00:16:23.250
Gosh, that's pretty strict.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:25.660
Hey, if just anyone could pass,

00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:28.090
it wouldn't be a national certificate.

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:29.160
That's true.

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:32.430
Dad, you think Jang Mi's doing okay?

00:16:32.430 --> 00:16:34.160
Of course. She's my daughter, after all.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:36.130
Since she takes after your mother,

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.600
she's good with her hands and very sharp,

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:40.270
so she's sure to pass.

00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:41.640
Yes.

00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:46.240
If it weren't for the accident,

00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.380
your mother would've been
a lawyer or a judge by now.

00:16:48.450 --> 00:16:50.180
That old story about passing
the first part of the bar exam.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:53.650
You've told me that a thousand times, Dad.
I'm sick of hearing it.

00:16:53.720 --> 00:16:56.120
It's because it still makes my blood boil,
you punk!

00:16:56.790 --> 00:16:58.160
Here, have some.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:00.420
- These gummies are good.
- All right.

00:17:02.490 --> 00:17:04.230
Look at my little bunny
sleeping so soundly.

00:17:04.960 --> 00:17:06.760
My little bunny is so pretty.

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:09.600
The phone is turned off.

00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.870
Please leave a message after the tone.

00:17:11.970 --> 00:17:13.300
Charges will apply after the beep...

00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.140
Unbelievable.

00:17:15.510 --> 00:17:18.580
You'll turn off your phone and ghost me?
Is that it?

00:17:19.010 --> 00:17:21.280
And you dare to pocket the money
for the guitar?

00:17:22.950 --> 00:17:25.220
Gosh, what am I supposed to do
with this woman?

00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.090
I was going to cut her some slack,
but I can't let this slide.

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:32.120
What are you muttering about
all by yourself?

00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:49.870
Here. You should put this on.

00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:51.980
You can't get blood on the food.

00:17:52.610 --> 00:17:54.510
- Thank you.
- Yes, hurry and put it on.

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:55.610
- Okay.
- All right.

00:17:57.510 --> 00:17:59.520
Oh, no! What do I do? It's burnt.

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:01.890
What do I do?

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:09.460
Gosh, it's hot!

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:29.880
Pull yourself together, Oh Jang Mi!

00:18:30.380 --> 00:18:31.450
I can't let it end like this.

00:19:31.040 --> 00:19:33.510
Time's up.
Please step away from your stations.

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.720
It's okay, Oh Jang Mi.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.230
Even if I get points taken off,
I didn't mess up anything else,

00:19:50.390 --> 00:19:51.460
so maybe...

00:19:51.800 --> 00:19:53.100
I can still pass.

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.500
Oh, please...

00:19:54.770 --> 00:19:58.540
Please let me pass
so I can finally meet Chef Kang Jun Ho.

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.780
Sir, you look amazing.

00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:10.150
This piece was practically made for you.

00:20:11.350 --> 00:20:13.980
- I'll take it.
- Yes, I'll get that ready for you.

00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:40.180
Ma'am.

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.680
- Me?
- You need to pay for that scarf.

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:45.150
You can't just leave with it.

00:20:45.950 --> 00:20:47.920
What are you talking about? What scarf?

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.720
- What kind of nonsense is this?
- It looks like you're playing dumb.

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:53.590
I'm going to have to check your bag.

00:20:55.590 --> 00:20:56.660
Are you out of your mind?

00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:58.330
How dare you stop me?

00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:00.800
I just need to check your bag.

00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:03.530
Do you have any idea who I am?

00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:05.840
It's me who keeps this store in business.

00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:07.470
Your paycheck...

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:09.440
comes from my wallet.

00:21:09.570 --> 00:21:10.910
You should know your place.

00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:13.440
If you keep this up,
I'll have to call the police!

00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:14.680
- What?
- Give it here.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.980
- Let go!
- Just a second.

00:21:15.980 --> 00:21:18.050
- Are you crazy?
- It'll just take a second.

00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:19.180
Let go of this.

00:21:19.550 --> 00:21:20.550
Seo Rin.

00:21:24.190 --> 00:21:25.320
Did you pick out your gift?

00:21:30.630 --> 00:21:31.930
So you chose this one and this one.

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:33.600
Not a bad choice.

00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:35.800
Could you ring these up, please?

00:21:37.170 --> 00:21:38.970
But...

00:21:38.970 --> 00:21:40.170
Is there a problem?

00:21:44.410 --> 00:21:45.440
Understood.

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.080
Thank you.

00:22:03.730 --> 00:22:05.130
Impressive, Chef Kang.

00:22:05.630 --> 00:22:09.500
You proved me right again, Chef Kang.
I knew I had a good eye.

00:22:11.070 --> 00:22:13.540
Honestly, I was curious
to see how you'd react.

00:22:16.840 --> 00:22:18.540
Are you telling me you were testing me?

00:22:19.980 --> 00:22:21.010
Obviously.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.010
You don't really think I'm stupid enough
to shoplift for no reason, do you?

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:26.820
- What?
- I was also bored.

00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:33.090
Does being bored give you the right
to steal from people as a joke?

00:22:34.890 --> 00:22:36.690
Don't look at me like that.
You're scaring me.

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:39.500
It's not like I meant to follow you here,
Chef Kang.

00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.630
I was bored and came to the store
to kill some time,

00:22:42.370 --> 00:22:44.270
and I just happened to see you
buying clothes.

00:22:46.040 --> 00:22:48.710
So you stole something in front of me...

00:22:48.710 --> 00:22:50.770
just to test my reaction?

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:53.710
What's so wrong with that?
If anything, you should be happy about it.

00:22:53.980 --> 00:22:56.550
After all, you passed my test, Chef Kang.

00:22:57.410 --> 00:22:59.520
You're an impressive man,
Chef Kang Jun Ho.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:02.990
You're qualified to date me.

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:08.130
Listen up.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.730
I have zero interest in dating you.

00:23:13.930 --> 00:23:16.030
Don't ever pull a stunt like this
in front of me again.

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:20.240
Do it again,
and I'll turn you over to the police.

00:23:26.880 --> 00:23:28.950
I can't stand entitled brats like you...

00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:32.320
who hide behind their parents.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:05.420
Darn it!

00:24:06.680 --> 00:24:08.450
How dare he say he's not interested in me?

00:24:10.650 --> 00:24:11.760
Kang Jun Ho...

00:24:12.420 --> 00:24:13.420
Just you wait.

00:24:14.190 --> 00:24:16.030
I will make you mine.

00:24:29.070 --> 00:24:30.570
What is it this time?

00:24:31.540 --> 00:24:32.710
What do you think?

00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.550
These are the outfits
for the hotel's grand reopening party.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.050
After all, I was your personal stylist,
CEO Chae.

00:24:39.450 --> 00:24:42.520
I was searching every single boutique
for this party,

00:24:42.750 --> 00:24:44.650
and I found the perfect dress.

00:24:45.390 --> 00:24:46.920
And the Chairman's tuxedo too.

00:24:47.220 --> 00:24:48.360
I don't want them. Take them back.

00:24:48.890 --> 00:24:50.990
This isn't just any reopening.

00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:52.900
As if I'd wear something you picked out.

00:24:53.330 --> 00:24:54.500
CEO Chae.

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:56.570
Hwa Young.

00:24:57.400 --> 00:24:58.600
Come on, friend.

00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.940
I went to so much trouble to find these.

00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:04.310
I'm having Designer Wang
handle everything this time.

00:25:04.880 --> 00:25:06.040
What's wrong, Mom?

00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:10.050
Ms. Yeom went to every shop
to find these for you.

00:25:10.550 --> 00:25:12.220
The least you could do
is pretend to wear it.

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:14.520
Ms. Yeom,
did you bring one for me as well?

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.990
Of course, Chairman.

00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:27.660
Oh, my.

00:25:27.930 --> 00:25:30.030
It suits you perfectly.

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:32.900
You look so dashing, Chairman.

00:25:35.710 --> 00:25:38.580
Come and sit here for a moment.

00:25:41.710 --> 00:25:44.150
Yes, Chairman.

00:25:45.080 --> 00:25:49.190
You've been in and out of this house
as my daughter-in-law's stylist for years.

00:25:49.620 --> 00:25:51.520
And having watched you all this time,

00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:54.320
I think you're someone I can trust.

00:25:55.090 --> 00:25:56.460
Absolutely, Chairman.

00:25:56.660 --> 00:25:59.700
I would die for you, Chairman.

00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:04.670
I know how much hardship you've endured
coming to this house all this time.

00:26:04.830 --> 00:26:05.940
I've seen it all.

00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:06.940
Chairman...

00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:11.270
Just knowing that you've noticed
is more than enough for me.

00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:13.910
You've put up with all the humiliation
from my daughter-in-law.

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:17.610
And yet, you always smile, so carefree.
You never change.

00:26:17.850 --> 00:26:20.880
You're like a streetlight,
always there in the same spot.

00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:24.120
- Chairman.
- I am...

00:26:24.550 --> 00:26:26.020
not one to trust people easily,

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:27.790
but you...

00:26:28.590 --> 00:26:29.860
should stay by my side...

00:26:30.590 --> 00:26:32.530
and be my shining light.

00:26:33.130 --> 00:26:34.130
Chairman.

00:26:35.270 --> 00:26:36.400
Thank you.

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:38.540
Thank you so much.

00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:42.770
You know...

00:26:43.210 --> 00:26:46.540
that I've always been in love
with you, don't you?

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:49.380
I'm so grateful that you...

00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:51.110
finally acknowledged my feelings.

00:26:53.350 --> 00:26:54.380
Chairman!

00:26:56.290 --> 00:26:59.160
Of course.
How could I not know how you felt?

00:26:59.690 --> 00:27:01.790
And from now on, no matter who it is,

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:03.990
do not say "I'm sorry" or "my apologies."

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.500
Don't you ever say anything
like that again.

00:27:06.130 --> 00:27:07.300
Chairman...

00:27:09.370 --> 00:27:12.940
- Chairman...
- What does she think she's doing?

00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:14.900
Yeom San Wol.

00:27:15.270 --> 00:27:18.940
How dare you scheme to become
the matriarch of Dream Group?

00:27:25.150 --> 00:27:28.520
So that was her ulterior motive
for coming to my house all this time?

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:30.290
Yeom San Wol.

00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.590
You think you're going to become
my mother-in-law?

00:27:33.160 --> 00:27:36.390
I'll never let that happen. Never!

00:27:37.830 --> 00:27:38.860
Hey.

00:27:39.230 --> 00:27:40.930
Have any part-time gigs opened up?

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.470
You must be a mind reader.

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:45.470
What is it? Is there really an opening?

00:27:45.570 --> 00:27:47.600
It's for the grand reopening party
at Dream Hotel.

00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:50.540
It's a private party,
invitation-only for VIPs.

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.440
So security will be super tight,
and it'll be a tough gig.

00:27:52.510 --> 00:27:55.080
But the tougher the job,
the better the pay, right?

00:27:55.650 --> 00:27:56.980
Thanks so much.

00:27:57.210 --> 00:27:58.250
Okay!

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:01.520
Jang Mi.

00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:03.990
Someone called after seeing the banner.

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:05.490
They said they saw your mom.

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:07.460
Are you serious?

00:28:08.220 --> 00:28:09.260
I'm telling you, it's true.

00:28:27.140 --> 00:28:28.710
(The First Man)

00:28:28.780 --> 00:28:31.710
You said you saw my wife, Suk Hee,
a long time ago?

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:35.350
I can soon find the person
who did this to you, Mom.

00:28:35.490 --> 00:28:36.750
The actress, Chae Hwa Young,

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:38.860
was the pin-up star of my generation.

00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:40.390
And now,

00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:42.390
you're my idol, Professor.

00:28:42.530 --> 00:28:44.290
You understood me when no one else did.

00:28:45.100 --> 00:28:48.730
I'm about to do a really high-paying gig,
so I'll pay you back as soon as I'm paid.

00:28:49.070 --> 00:28:50.770
She kind of looks like Director Ma.

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:57.040
