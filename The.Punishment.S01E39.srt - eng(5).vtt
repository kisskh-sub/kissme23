the police uniform I wear.

But I got in deeper and deeper.

00:34:27.190 --> 00:34:27.920
Actually,

00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:32.620
when the incident with Xiong Chao
at the hospital happened, I knew

00:34:33.719 --> 00:34:35.520
there was no turning back for me.

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:38.429
I'm finished.

00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.250

after all these years they invested in me.

00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:51.190

and provide us with valuable leads,

00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.180
so we can find Meng Yu
as soon as possible.

00:35:28.510 --> 00:35:29.400
Well.

00:35:32.070 --> 00:35:34.230
They wanted to send Meng Yu away.

00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:36.400
I was the one

00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:38.160
who forged the identity.

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:42.000
I've already given you
Kang's contact information.

00:35:43.070 --> 00:35:44.920
But I really don't know

00:35:46.710 --> 00:35:48.190
where she actually is.

00:36:04.150 --> 00:36:04.880
Director Ye.

00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.000
The phone number Peng Hanzhang provided
has been turned off this whole time.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.320
We can't locate it at the moment.

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:08.960
Keep looking.

00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:09.440
Okay.

00:36:11.710 --> 00:36:12.570
Captain Zhong.

00:36:12.590 --> 00:36:14.230
Send Meng Yu's personal information

00:36:14.230 --> 00:36:15.550
to all the stations
and docks immediately.

00:36:15.550 --> 00:36:16.510
We must find her.

00:36:16.710 --> 00:36:17.910
I'll do it right away.

00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:55.950
[Mom]

00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.470
[Mom]

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:10.810
Son.

00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:16.620
Mom.

00:37:22.150 --> 00:37:23.480
How are Ziyi and Baoying

00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:25.210
doing?

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:27.710
They're fine.

00:37:29.110 --> 00:37:32.370
Baoying went to bed early.
He was tired from playing today.

00:37:32.710 --> 00:37:33.760
Ziyi

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.000
is also much better.

00:37:47.280 --> 00:37:48.360
It's getting cold.

00:37:49.710 --> 00:37:50.360
Don't...

00:37:51.880 --> 00:37:52.840
catch a cold.

00:37:55.970 --> 00:37:59.630
Don't try to save the thermal underwear
I bought you— just wear it.

00:37:59.660 --> 00:38:00.660
I'm wearing it.

00:38:22.930 --> 00:38:23.780
Mom.

00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:31.150
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:39:51.150 --> 00:39:52.810
[Peng is exposed.
Meng Yu must never be found.]

00:39:53.740 --> 00:39:55.170
Peng is exposed.

00:39:55.740 --> 00:39:57.780
Meng Yu must never be found.

00:40:03.810 --> 00:40:04.410
Qin Feng.

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:05.670
He Kang's phone just turned on.

00:40:05.670 --> 00:40:07.280
We've tracked the phone's location.

00:40:07.280 --> 00:40:07.990
It's in Beishun Town
at the foot of the mountain.

00:40:07.990 --> 00:40:09.210
[Pingsha Road parking lot] [Xingfu Road]

00:40:09.210 --> 00:40:11.280
There are many residential areas
and commercial streets.

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.740
We need your help
to find the exact location.

00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:15.020
I've sent you the location.

00:40:15.020 --> 00:40:15.400
[Captain Qin]

00:40:15.400 --> 00:40:18.030
Previously, Meng Yu was held in

00:40:18.030 --> 00:40:20.560
the residential complex
developed by Ma Jin.

00:40:21.070 --> 00:40:22.270
Next to that complex,

00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:25.070
there are several
commercial office buildings.

00:40:25.070 --> 00:40:26.140
They all belonged to Ma Jin.

00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:27.510
I think Meng Yu might now be

00:40:27.510 --> 00:40:29.280
held in one of those office buildings.

00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:29.880
Well,

00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.420
Mai and I

00:40:31.590 --> 00:40:33.280
will go check it out first.

00:40:34.230 --> 00:40:34.860
Qin Feng,

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.660
I agree with your assessment.

00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:38.760
Send people immediately

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:40.480
to thoroughly search those

00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:41.960
apartments and office buildings.

00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:42.820
Captain Zhong,

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:43.960
notify the bureau immediately.

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:44.880
Locate the phone

00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:45.880
and conduct a search immediately.

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:46.670
