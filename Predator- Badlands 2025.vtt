02:43.833 --> 02:46.958
I sense you, brother.

02:52.916 --> 02:54.250
Hiding...

02:57.333 --> 02:59.333
...behind your cloak.

03:01.791 --> 03:04.083
It is time to earn yours.

03:15.875 --> 03:17.791
Still too small to take me head on.

03:18.083 --> 03:19.041
Use the cave!

03:33.666 --> 03:35.125
You fight with rage.

03:35.500 --> 03:37.333
I fight like father.

03:38.500 --> 03:41.791
You are not father, you are Dek!

04:34.458 --> 04:35.791
Do you yield?

04:36.041 --> 04:37.083
Never!

04:37.875 --> 04:39.125
Good.

05:07.708 --> 05:10.625
I'm still alive, brother.

05:12.208 --> 05:15.124
Still much to prove...

05:15.125 --> 05:17.625
...to show who you are.

05:18.125 --> 05:20.583
I am Yautja.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.208
Not yet.

05:26.625 --> 05:28.791
Are you holding your sword, Kwei?

05:30.041 --> 05:31.666
No.

05:31.875 --> 05:33.041
Pick it up!

06:02.541 --> 06:05.000
You kept this toy?!

06:05.458 --> 06:08.333
You remember what happened...

06:09.291 --> 06:12.208
I lost my fang!

06:13.250 --> 06:16.666
And you saved my life.

06:17.416 --> 06:20.000
You protected me.

06:20.708 --> 06:21.958
Come here.

06:30.041 --> 06:32.125
Fixed it for you.

06:35.416 --> 06:37.708
Don't blow yourself up.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.583
Today you make a vow...

06:55.916 --> 06:59.250
...as our ancestors did before you.

06:59.750 --> 07:03.000
To earn your place in the clan...

07:03.333 --> 07:05.625
...you must choose your prey.

07:07.125 --> 07:09.125
Bring it home...

07:10.333 --> 07:13.000
...or never return.

07:20.541 --> 07:22.416
Wait - Go back!

07:26.625 --> 07:28.166
Genna.

07:28.541 --> 07:30.666
The death planet.

07:31.875 --> 07:35.541
Home of the un-killable Kalisk.

07:38.833 --> 07:41.958
Even father fears it.

07:43.208 --> 07:46.333
Then the Kalisk shall be my trophy.

07:46.875 --> 07:49.458
Father calls me the weakest...

07:50.416 --> 07:53.750
...so I must kill the strongest.

07:54.708 --> 07:57.250
Failure means death.

07:58.958 --> 08:02.000
Then I will not fail.

08:02.625 --> 08:04.791
I cannot allow it.

08:08.750 --> 08:10.416
I make my vow.

08:13.000 --> 08:15.541
I make my vow!

09:11.041 --> 09:11.875
Father.

09:13.375 --> 09:16.875
I welcome you with honor.

09:28.750 --> 09:31.875
Why is it not done?

09:32.708 --> 09:35.291
He deserves a hunt.

09:37.041 --> 09:40.083
He is our clan's weakness...

09:41.416 --> 09:43.791
...weakness must be culled.

09:44.833 --> 09:47.791
He will bring home the Kalisk.

09:49.833 --> 09:51.457
Foolishness.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.500
He is a runt.

09:54.000 --> 09:57.875
You should have done it as he slept.

09:58.583 --> 09:59.666
Kill him!

10:00.541 --> 10:01.375
Now!

10:11.791 --> 10:14.708
He will only honor us in death.

10:30.375 --> 10:31.750
Father.

10:44.166 --> 10:45.666
Kwei?

10:46.541 --> 10:48.958
Be brave, brother.

11:38.958 --> 11:40.041
Father!

11:50.500 --> 11:51.625
Kwei!!!

12:04.833 --> 12:08.041
To forgive weakness...

12:09.541 --> 12:11.916
...is to show weakness.

12:13.916 --> 12:15.708
No! Father, no!

12:23.791 --> 12:25.500
Get your sword!

12:28.583 --> 12:29.791
Kwei!!!

12:43.208 --> 12:45.916
Launch sequence initiated.

12:56.041 --> 12:58.541
Bring it home.

16:00.791 --> 16:02.833
Bring it home.

16:05.333 --> 16:07.375
For Kwei.

23:05.458 --> 23:07.708
Yautja hunt alone.

25:33.166 --> 25:35.375
What happened to your legs?

26:23.666 --> 26:26.000
You have seen the Kalisk?

27:14.375 --> 27:16.332
Useful...

27:16.333 --> 27:17.958
like tool?

27:38.125 --> 27:40.583
I will use you, tool.

28:50.250 --> 28:51.583
Don't want flies.

29:30.625 --> 29:32.375
Name is Dek.

29:33.375 --> 29:35.166
Now talk that way.

30:09.458 --> 30:12.166
How long have you been here?

30:33.916 --> 30:35.750
Who would come?

30:50.708 --> 30:53.583
Sensitivity is weakness.

33:58.666 --> 34:00.958
I must eat.

34:13.458 --> 34:15.500
What is this creature?

34:21.291 --> 34:24.833
Then it will be my food, too.

34:33.333 --> 34:34.958
Quiet tool!

34:48.750 --> 34:51.041
You give up too easily.

37:33.416 --> 37:34.500
Kalisk?

38:49.041 --> 38:50.916
You give up too easily.

41:14.375 --> 41:18.041
When I pierced its head with my sword,

41:18.500 --> 41:22.208
and its blood rushed down my face.

41:40.000 --> 41:42.333
This flesh is not sweet.

42:12.083 --> 42:14.416
I have no clan!

42:18.666 --> 42:20.416
No clan.

42:26.708 --> 42:29.708
I had a brother.

42:37.750 --> 42:41.291
Father killed him.

42:47.125 --> 42:49.791
Grief is weakness.

42:56.291 --> 42:59.625
I am here for Kalisk.

43:01.708 --> 43:04.500
Why are you here?

43:19.333 --> 43:22.666
You should be able to survive on your own.

43:34.833 --> 43:37.958
Tessa is your sister.

44:08.333 --> 44:09.833
And legs.

44:13.208 --> 44:14.791
Find your sister.

44:15.833 --> 44:17.708
And legs.

47:40.666 --> 47:41.708
The sun rises.

47:42.625 --> 47:43.791
Let's go.

47:51.125 --> 47:53.500
Yautja hunt alone.

47:58.833 --> 48:00.333
You're a tool.

48:10.791 --> 48:14.375
We're not in the tree now.

49:09.791 --> 49:11.875
Kalisk?

49:17.416 --> 49:19.208
It drinks here.

49:21.583 --> 49:23.750
It drinks here?

49:26.875 --> 49:30.958
You are a useless tool if you don't speak.

49:57.541 --> 50:00.416
My brother was protecting me.

50:05.666 --> 50:09.000
The clan can have no weakness.

50:10.208 --> 50:12.750
I will show them strength.

50:38.041 --> 50:39.915
Wolf.

50:39.916 --> 50:42.958
This alpha must be a great killer.

50:43.375 --> 50:46.125
I will hunt it too.

50:58.916 --> 51:00.583
I see...

51:02.875 --> 51:07.125
But I will be the alpha
that kills the most.

51:41.625 --> 51:43.458
The Kalisk's den?

52:11.875 --> 52:13.708
Who are they?

53:12.208 --> 53:13.916
Easier to walk now.

53:16.875 --> 53:17.708
No.

53:18.291 --> 53:20.666
Easier for me to walk now.

53:36.750 --> 53:39.375
I too will remember this...

53:39.708 --> 53:43.583
today I become Dek of the Yautja.

53:44.333 --> 53:47.166
I will honor Kwei...

53:48.750 --> 53:52.041
when I bring the Kalisk home.

53:54.083 --> 53:57.375
Then I taste revenge.

53:58.875 --> 54:02.333
You will be the first to see my trophy.

54:04.166 --> 54:06.125
It is a great honor.

54:07.208 --> 54:08.666
For you.

54:19.041 --> 54:19.875
What?

54:25.083 --> 54:28.083
I came here for the Kalisk.

54:36.000 --> 54:38.416
You want my trophy.

54:41.791 --> 54:43.958
Where is the Kalisk?

54:48.541 --> 54:53.041
I use you, tool. You do not use me!

54:58.125 --> 55:00.625
I use you!

55:02.583 --> 55:05.041
Where is the Kalisk?

55:14.500 --> 55:18.583
Then my death will be honorable.

55:24.333 --> 55:26.333
Call your sister.

55:27.291 --> 55:29.541
None can stop me.

58:55.000 --> 58:57.041
Save yourself, tool!

01:00:52.916 --> 01:00:55.416
Tool, get these off!

01:01:03.208 --> 01:01:05.166
You are not Thia.

01:01:17.583 --> 01:01:19.416
Release me!

01:01:22.375 --> 01:01:25.458
You are another broken tool!

01:01:40.541 --> 01:01:42.750
Remove these!

01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:48.708
Or I'll rip out your spine
and crush your skull!

01:01:58.375 --> 01:02:02.666
You are nothing. A device.

01:02:03.958 --> 01:02:07.583
Made by others to do their work for them.

01:03:21.541 --> 01:03:24.125
You betrayed me!

01:07:54.333 --> 01:07:56.041
I trusted you.

01:08:02.208 --> 01:08:04.582
Don't like these tools.

01:08:04.583 --> 01:08:07.082
I'm sorry. My sister is -

01:08:07.083 --> 01:08:09.041
Don't like sister either.

01:08:16.708 --> 01:08:19.375
Tell tool you're asking about the device.

01:08:29.875 --> 01:08:32.333
He's asking about the device.

01:08:32.750 --> 01:08:35.333
It's a children's toy.

01:08:37.125 --> 01:08:39.791
But say it's a map.

01:08:48.916 --> 01:08:51.708
Tell tool to look inside.

01:09:00.166 --> 01:09:02.124
That was a toy for children?

01:09:02.125 --> 01:09:03.250
Yautja children!

01:09:09.916 --> 01:09:10.791
Run Dek!

01:09:13.083 --> 01:09:14.541
Go... Go!

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:29.041
Enter destination coordinates, Kwei.

01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.291
You saved me, brother.

01:12:10.583 --> 01:12:13.541
Wolf.

01:13:35.208 --> 01:13:37.000
Kalisk.

01:13:43.291 --> 01:13:46.791
Kalisk child.

01:20:46.041 --> 01:20:47.708
I came to rescue you.

01:20:56.583 --> 01:20:57.958
Wolf.

01:21:05.333 --> 01:21:07.083
Bone Bison.

01:21:17.458 --> 01:21:19.541
Not yet...

01:21:20.125 --> 01:21:21.708
Thia.

01:21:40.375 --> 01:21:41.708
Kalisk!

01:21:47.708 --> 01:21:49.041
Kalisk child!

01:21:53.708 --> 01:21:55.708
They have her mother!

01:22:12.541 --> 01:22:14.665
You free the Kalisk.

01:22:14.666 --> 01:22:16.333
I get my trophy.

01:27:11.000 --> 01:27:13.083
You tell me.

01:33:02.291 --> 01:33:04.541
That's not yours.

01:33:37.958 --> 01:33:40.666
Not yet.

01:34:33.625 --> 01:34:35.583
You've come here for revenge?

01:34:36.375 --> 01:34:39.208
I've come for my cloak.

01:34:43.500 --> 01:34:45.083
What is this?

01:34:45.583 --> 01:34:48.333
I've completed my hunt.

01:34:48.833 --> 01:34:51.208
That is my trophy.

01:34:52.708 --> 01:34:54.207
You disgrace our clan...

01:34:54.208 --> 01:34:55.666
And so did Kwei.

01:34:58.916 --> 01:35:02.416
Get rid of him.

01:36:56.333 --> 01:37:00.958
Perhaps the right son did survive.

01:37:01.708 --> 01:37:04.040
Yield now...

01:37:04.041 --> 01:37:07.333
...and take your place in our clan.

01:37:09.041 --> 01:37:12.250
I have my own clan.

01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.791
No.

01:38:36.541 --> 01:38:40.166
It's my mother.
