WEBVTT

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:34.800
When she went back to the island,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.880
she had a gun with her.

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:36.920
and got caught by us.

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.160
Fukuda found out about this.

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:41.160
I know that too.

00:01:42.039 --> 00:01:43.280
One of our senior officers

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:44.920
to get a gun for her lover.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:48.400
There's nothing to be surprised about.

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:49.800
Anything else?

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:53.600
According to the investigation on the well,

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:54.800
we found that there were

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:56.240
all her clothes and accessories

00:01:56.880 --> 00:02:00.240
are not in line with her identity.

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.720
Commander.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.320
This is like a spy.

00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.240
With these?

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:08.400
Are you sure

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.080
the Colonel brought is a spy?

00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:10.880
I dare not.

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:13.560
This woman is marked as a dancer.

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:15.320
But she lacks that kind of dancer.

00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.040
She's so passionate.

00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.400
Yes.

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:24.640
a noble lady.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:26.960
I know what you want to say.

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:30.960
Lord Ye was a diplomat in the previous dynasty.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.400
His daughter should have

00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.000
a noble lady.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.400
I couldn't survive in Shanghai.

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:39.160
I became a backup dancer.

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.400
This is also forced by life.

00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:42.240
Back to the island,

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:43.520
This woman met her father.

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:45.600
The passion of the dancers you mentioned

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:46.520
I can’t even hide them.

00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.160
But Commander,

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.760
Do you know

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:59.360
Do you know what that means?

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:02.120
Innocent?

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.080
The diplomat

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.680
know the First Law.

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.320
Everyone will pay special attention

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:12.320
his first impression.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.360
This kind of impression is hard to change.

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.400
The first information you got

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.120
was this woman came to the island with a gun.

00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.360
So your first impression was

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:24.600
this woman was a spy.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:26.560
So,

00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.200
you must have spent a lot of time

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.600
to find more reasons.

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:32.120
But Commander,

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.520
Judging from her clothes,

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.520
the Special Forces Police Brigade

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:40.640
You don't study women's clothes all day.

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.040
posture, body talk and dress all day?

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.920
I know about Colonel.

00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.520
But that woman is Chinese.

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.000
If you trust her completely,

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000
is very dangerous.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.720
Besides,

00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:54.760
if there's more than one reason

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.920
to come back to this island,

00:03:58.640 --> 00:03:59.880
What else could it be?

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.760
I'm not sure yet.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.640
But I don't think I should forget.

00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:06.920
her father and Americans

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:08.160
related to the Americans.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:11.000
Before we have solid evidence,

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.320
all your deductions

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.480
is just a wishful doubt.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.040
I'll take a look.

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.480
Don't make any trouble.

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.159
Kewen.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.280
What are you playing?

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:38.920
Here.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:42.560
Give it to me.

00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:43.120
This one.

00:04:44.920 --> 00:04:45.720
Look at this.

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.320
Kewen, I have something for you.

00:04:49.320 --> 00:04:50.280
I'll change it with you.

00:04:54.520 --> 00:04:55.600
I'll change this with you.

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:10.720
Look.

00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.400
American lighter.

00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.560
[The Major's belongings.]

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.560
Get in.

00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:30.680
Get in.

00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.560
There's a tail.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:47.720
Are you thinking

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:53.840
why I have to take special care of Lord Ye De?

00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.400
Our Great Japan Empire

00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.520
is basically a island

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.480
of a single nation.

00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:00.720
Other than the tribe,

00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.560
it's hard for other countries to establish a foothold.

00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:06.160
But it's different here.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.360
This place

00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:09.800
is famous for its expansion overseas.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:11.520
They are Chinese.

00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.600
After Ming Qing, many people went to Nanyang

00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:17.840
and traveled far away to do business or settle down.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.600
Ye De Gong is the most

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.760
among them.

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.400
He was a diplomat.

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.520
He was a businessman.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:25.120
They can create new situations

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:27.160
in Hawaii.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:31.520
If such a person can be used by us,

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.600
Violence won't

00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.320
violence won't make him surrender.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:39.920
Only by subduing him mentally

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.280
can we really rule him.

00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:43.880
As long as the chief of the island is ruled,

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.920
the people on this island

00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:46.840
willingly

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:47.920
the foot of our Japanese Empire.

00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:49.400
Do you understand?

00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:50.280
Check.

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.640
Got it.

00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:54.200
Oshima!

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.640
I don't doubt your ability.

00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:04.040
If you insist,

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.800
we have to investigate what we should.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.000
But

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:10.760
Pay attention to the way.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.520
Thank you.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.320
Excuse me.

00:07:25.160 --> 00:07:27.000
Find Lieutenant Sakamoto

00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000
and find out what the mission is

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.920
to the island.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.320
Don't alert the commander.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:40.840
Irigami.

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:41.520
Yes.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:43.480
Colonel and that woman.

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:46.159
What do you think?

00:07:46.159 --> 00:07:47.120
Don't you think they're unusual?

00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:50.360
That arrogant guy.

00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:52.520
Why did you come to the island?

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.040
Commander didn’t tell you?

00:07:56.040 --> 00:07:56.720
No.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.000
He didn't say anything.

00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:01.520
It must be something.

00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:04.120
A few days ago,

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:07.560
we shot down a American plane.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.880
Then a American

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:10.000
landed on the island.

00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.640
At that moment,

00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.880
Colonel and that woman went to the island.

00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:18.400
Is there any connection?

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:19.600
I've been thinking about it.

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.040
There's no direct evidence yet,

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:22.320
that there is an inevitable connection

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:24.040
between these two things.

00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:33.760
I think something big is going to happen on the island.

00:08:34.559 --> 00:08:37.360
Let's do our best to find

00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:39.480
the American.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.520
If they really came to the island

00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.360
for this,

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:45.600
As long as we have that American,

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:49.200
he will come to us.

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:54.560
To drive him crazy, we must destroy him first.

00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:57.680
If we know

00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:00.000
the real purpose of Colonel,

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:01.920
the colonel will go crazy.

00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:03.320
In this case,

00:09:03.320 --> 00:09:04.640
we have the initiative.

00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:06.320
Yes.

00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:08.920
Captain.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:12.960
What you said about destruction and madness.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.240
The order is upside down.

00:09:26.560 --> 00:09:28.040
Open the rail.

00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:29.240
I want to see your captain.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.160
Colonel.

00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.560
Our captain is not here.

00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:32.880
Where did he go?

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.760
Our captain and vice-captain

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.280
went to Fukuda Tavern.

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.200
Okay.

00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:46.400
Do you want to

00:09:46.400 --> 00:09:47.680
should we investigate it?

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:48.320
Captain.

00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:49.680
Don't mind it.

00:09:49.680 --> 00:09:50.520
I'm sorry.

00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:50.960
Captain.

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:52.280
None of your business.

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:54.920
I know.

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.800
It's just a mistake.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.040
Investigate Tang Ju.

00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:07.080
Mind your words and actions.

00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:09.160
Tang Bingchen is still useful to us.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:11.760
Take care of yourself.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.240
Yes, sir.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:18.880
Captain.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:23.640
That idiot's lighter

00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:25.720
was caught by Colonel Takemici.

00:10:26.560 --> 00:10:27.200
Colonel.

00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:31.160
This is...

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.480
American lighter.

00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.680
Captain Oshima, sit down.

00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:40.520
Captain Oshima

00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:41.800
Haven't you been looking for that American?

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:43.880
My assistant Ye Bi-ying.

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.360
found this thing

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:46.800
on Kewen today.

00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:50.560
Did Miss Ye find it by accident?

00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:51.960
She has known Kewen since childhood.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.360
We grew up together.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.160
Why

00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:57.680
on Kewen?

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:01.520
You should investigate this.

00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:03.000
I just know this

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.160
might help you.

00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.840
so I brought it here for you.

00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:09.560
Irigami, pour some wine for Colonel.

00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:11.120
No.

00:11:12.080 --> 00:11:13.960
Miss Ye is waiting for me outside.

00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:16.240
I should go now.

00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.880
Thank you.

00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:24.360
Colonel.

00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:29.680
I want to kindly remind you

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.520
Be careful of the woman beside you.

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:50.240
What does he mean?

00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.360
What was that?

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:01.760
The colonel's woman took the lighter.

00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.360
It's okay. Go down.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.800
Don't be nervous.

00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:40.400
No one will follow us today.

00:12:43.640 --> 00:12:44.160
Because

00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:46.280
we gave the lighter to Oshima Hao

00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:48.040
and let his guard down on us.

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.920
That's half right.

00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.560
Before we came to the island,

00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.560
they already suspected your father.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:55.360
So,

00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.640
some things are inevitable.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.360
What we can do now

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:01.000
is to try our best to avoid mistakes.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.760
How do we go?

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:11.280
Turn left at the intersection ahead.

00:13:27.960 --> 00:13:30.800
The village was slaughtered too.

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.400
I guess there's only a house left.

00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:37.000
There's no one left.

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:42.920
What's wrong?

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.880
I want you to remember what I said.

00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:50.240
From now on, don't be emotional.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.080
Try to think rationally

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:52.960
in a rational way.

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:56.200
What do you mean?

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:57.480
Just remember it.

00:13:58.120 --> 00:13:58.920
Nothing.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:10.280
That cave is right ahead.

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:18.960
It's right ahead.

00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:27.160
It's here.

00:15:01.200 --> 00:15:02.040
I told you

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:03.320
It's big inside, isn't it?

00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:10.400
Major Wilt.

00:15:15.400 --> 00:15:17.840
I'm Ye Bi Ying, the daughter of Lord Ye De.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:19.800
My father told me

00:15:19.800 --> 00:15:20.720
you were here.

00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.240
We're coming in.

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.280
Is there only one way?

00:15:30.840 --> 00:15:31.640
Stand behind me.

00:16:58.160 --> 00:16:59.160
Will.

00:17:08.079 --> 00:17:09.839
We're here to rescue you.

00:17:10.319 --> 00:17:11.280
My mission

00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.079
is to bring you and your belongings

00:17:14.079 --> 00:17:15.520
to a safe place.

00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:23.520
Are you Japanese?

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.280
I'm Ichiro Takemichi.

00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:29.600
We're here specially for you.

00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:34.840
Major Wilt.

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:37.200
Sam greets you.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.920
I heard from my father that you're injured.

00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:49.840
I studied medicine.

00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.320
Let me check it for you.

00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.600
I'll touch your body later.

00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.480
Don't be nervous.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:01.880
Take a deep breath in cooperation.

00:18:03.280 --> 00:18:04.080
Wait.

00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:08.520
Okay.

00:18:08.800 --> 00:18:11.480
Take a deep breath. Slow down.

00:18:15.800 --> 00:18:17.360
I think the ribs are broken.

00:18:17.360 --> 00:18:18.600
It's not appropriate to make a big move.

00:18:18.880 --> 00:18:20.640
If you stab your lungs,

00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.000
it'll cause hemopneumothorax.

00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:27.720
Keep an eye on the door.

00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:29.800
I have something to say to Major Wilt.

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.960
There's some food here.

00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:42.000
You guys talk first.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:21.720
I basically understand the situation on this island.

00:19:22.120 --> 00:19:23.880
I need to leave as soon as possible.

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:24.840
Do you have any plans?

00:19:24.840 --> 00:19:25.760
When are you leaving?

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:27.120
You're in danger.

00:19:28.080 --> 00:19:29.760
You could be caught anytime.

00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:31.760
And I didn't expect you to be so badly injured.

00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:32.880
I couldn't move.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.720
So I can think of

00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:36.720
the safest way.

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:40.000
Give me the information.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.840
I'll leave the island as soon as possible.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:44.360
That's impossible.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:48.480
Maybe I didn't make it clear to you.

00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.840
I'll tell you slowly.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:52.800
Major Wilt.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:53.720
Your mission

00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:56.080
is to hand over the information to the National Government.

00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:57.360
My mission

00:19:57.360 --> 00:19:59.240
is to get information from you

00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:00.320
to the National Government.

00:20:00.560 --> 00:20:02.320
So our mission is the same.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.960
There's no difference between us.

00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:05.400
Give me the information.

00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:06.480
I'll send it to the National Government.

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.080
our mission

00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:09.200
is done.

00:20:09.520 --> 00:20:10.080
Okay?

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.000
In other words,

00:20:27.080 --> 00:20:28.080
our existence

00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:30.520
to complete this mission.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.400
You are a soldier.

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.560
I'm also a soldier.

00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.200
I hope you can understand

00:20:34.560 --> 00:20:35.800
I hope you can understand

00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.560
and accept your mission.

00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:38.840
I understand

00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:40.560
and my mission.

00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:41.840
So I

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:44.120
to deliver the information myself.

00:20:46.760 --> 00:20:47.880
Do you understand?

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:49.640
You take yourself too seriously.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:51.720
If the information

00:20:51.720 --> 00:20:52.880
from you,

00:20:53.080 --> 00:20:53.840
they will send

00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:55.200
to China.

00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:57.600
The longer you waste here,

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.120
the lower your value will be.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.320
Do you understand?

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.360
The current situation of China

00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.480
The second believer

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:05.960
is basically impossible to get there safely.

00:21:06.200 --> 00:21:07.760
The only thing you need to do now

00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.040
is to get me out safely.

00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:13.240
I can tell you

00:21:13.800 --> 00:21:15.480
In my authorization,

00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:17.920
I have the right to decide

00:21:18.280 --> 00:21:20.080
based on the information.

00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:22.600
So even if you don't give me the information,

00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:24.400
I need you

00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.040
to me.

00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:36.480
Before April 19th,

00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:39.000
If I didn't

00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.120
deliver this information safely,

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:43.920
will affect the whole plan.

00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:44.560
Not enough.

00:21:46.720 --> 00:21:49.200
This plan concerns

00:21:49.200 --> 00:21:51.520
even the whole world.

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.400
is more important than our lives.

00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:56.240
That's all I can tell you.

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.320
I have to tell you

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.200
In my authorization,

00:22:13.800 --> 00:22:15.200
I have the right

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.240
not you.

00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:23.040
Ichiro Takemuki, put down your gun!

00:22:24.520 --> 00:22:25.760
How could you do this?

00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:27.720
You sent me away just to kill me.

00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.560
Put the gun down.

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.000
Or I'll really shoot.

00:22:33.600 --> 00:22:34.400
Put it down.

00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.960
Miss Ye.

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:40.800
Miss Ye.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.040
Don't be nervous.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.040
Your friend won't kill me yet.

00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:48.320
Because he knows

00:22:49.120 --> 00:22:49.960
he can't

00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:51.480
to the National Government.

00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.240
Why didn't you get the information?

00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:58.720
and let the believer die.

00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.480
right?

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:03.040
It's not safe here now.

00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.760
But you need to hide here for a few days.

00:23:06.720 --> 00:23:07.480
I'll find you

00:23:07.480 --> 00:23:08.880
a safer place for you.

00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:15.080
There's food in the bag.

00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:16.800
I'll be back tomorrow.

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.640
I'll get you a Japanese military uniform.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.960
It's easier to move.

00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:35.000
You'd better remember what I said.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:37.200
Don't pull your gun

00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:38.480
don't pull out your gun.

00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:40.040
Even if you do,

00:23:40.040 --> 00:23:40.880
remember two things.

00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:42.520
First,

00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:45.280
Are you sure the gun is pointing to your enemy?

00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:47.320
Second,

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:50.200
Turn on the insurance before you shoot.

00:23:57.720 --> 00:23:58.480
Will.

00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:02.080
No one wants to detonate it.

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:13.800
I'll bring you some medicine.

00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:15.800
Eat something and take a rest.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:00.840
Okay, I understand.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.080
I'll tell him.

00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:08.400
Major.

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.840
The front line of Myanmar

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:12.040
may disappoint you.

00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:14.240
How's the situation at the front line?

00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:15.640
Yesterday,

00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:17.800
more than 200 Japanese airplanes

00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.080
attacked Ma Gyu Airport in La Xu.

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:21.240
The British air force and American volunteer team

00:25:21.240 --> 00:25:22.160
at the airport.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:23.760
was caught off guard.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:24.560
We lost a lot.

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:26.080
That means...

00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:27.240
I still can't move.

00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.120
Really?

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:31.320
Either

00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:33.400
to fly over Himalayas

00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.320
or be beaten down by the Japanese.

00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:38.200
We've lost a believer.

00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:40.360
I don't want anything to happen to you again.

00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.360
Time is running out.

00:25:43.720 --> 00:25:45.240
Give me a few more days, Major.

00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:46.360
Things are getting better.

00:25:46.360 --> 00:25:47.840
I'll arrange it right away.

00:25:56.360 --> 00:25:57.280
Go ahead.

00:25:57.280 --> 00:25:58.680
If you shoot him to death,

00:25:58.680 --> 00:26:00.480
will you shoot me to death?

00:26:00.760 --> 00:26:02.040
I've found the messenger for you

00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:03.040
and complete our mission.

00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.520
I'm no longer useful to you.

00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:05.520
Am I right?

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:08.520
Tell me.

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:11.480
Is it more convenient for you

00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:12.560
after you kill me?

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.360
I never kill pretty women.

00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:19.600
Can you be serious?

00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:20.560
I'm quite serious.

00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:21.480
Why not?

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:22.520
I'm not serious because I said you're pretty.

00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.560
I'm serious when I say you're ugly.

00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.480
Can you calm down?

00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:26.320
Calm down.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.040
In front of me,

00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:28.160
in front of me.

00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:29.000
How can I calm down?

00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:30.160
I didn't want to kill him.

00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:31.520
I just wanted to scare him.

00:26:31.600 --> 00:26:32.280
I didn't get any information.

00:26:32.280 --> 00:26:33.480
Why should I kill him?

00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:36.200
So you'll kill him if you get the information.

00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:37.600
You said it.

00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:39.600
Cold-blooded.

00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:41.360
and inhumane.

00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:42.880
Cold-blooded.

00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:45.600
When did I say that?

00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.360
Why did you hit me?

00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:53.200
You're not serious.

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:54.200
If I didn't help you,

00:26:54.200 --> 00:26:54.840
if I didn't help you?

00:26:54.840 --> 00:26:56.200
Why are you being serious again?

00:26:57.320 --> 00:26:58.560
Fine, I'll be serious with you.

00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:00.480
We've found the messenger.

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:00.880
right?

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:01.880
The first task

00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:03.000
is to report to the staff

00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.480
to the superiors.

00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.080
Also,

00:27:05.680 --> 00:27:06.000
let me tell you.

00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:06.480
it's not safe here.

00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:07.320
We need to

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:08.320
find him a new hideout.

00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:10.320
There's no one here.

00:27:10.320 --> 00:27:11.040
Why is it not safe?

00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:12.080
It's because no one is here.

00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:13.040
That's why it's not safe.

00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:15.760
Let's go, beautiful woman.

00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:22.240
What are you waiting for?

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.160
Are you coming?

00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:41.360
How is it?

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.840
I saw the Major himself.

00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:43.560
But we have to

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:45.280
for him.

00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:46.520
Why?

00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:48.240
Isn't that place

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:50.280
Isn't it the best place to hide?

00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.560
That's why

00:27:51.880 --> 00:27:52.360
That's why

00:27:52.360 --> 00:27:53.880
the key area of their search.

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:55.360
Our hideout

00:27:55.360 --> 00:27:56.720
hit their gun.

00:27:57.600 --> 00:27:58.600
No way.

00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.160
Not many people know the cave in the grass mountain.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:05.080
As far as I know, there was a mountain village down the mountain.

00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:06.480
It's the best place to hide people.

00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:07.120
Police Brigade.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.560
We won't let this go.

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.920
They will soon find that area.

00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.360
I was thoughtless.

00:28:16.360 --> 00:28:17.520
Mr. Ye,

00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:18.720
Don't blame yourself.

00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:20.720
You are familiar with the village.

00:28:20.720 --> 00:28:22.080
Think about it.

00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:24.280
Is there a better place to hide?

00:28:24.840 --> 00:28:26.560
Apart from Mount Hudang,

00:28:27.360 --> 00:28:29.200
that is the mountain in the north.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.160
But it's a long way.

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:35.920
Now the Japanese are investigating.

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:36.480
I'm afraid...

00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.960
There's an old Chinese saying.

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.360
"Hidden in the City."

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.640
The livelier it is, the safer it is.

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.160
The less vigilant they are,

00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:44.880
Think about it.

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:46.240
It looks lively

00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:47.480
But the soldiers on the island

00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:48.920
would never expect to search there.

00:28:57.760 --> 00:28:58.920
What are you doing?

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.360
There is such a place.

00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:09.880
Ju.

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:13.640
Ju!

00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:16.800
Why are you here?

00:29:17.480 --> 00:29:18.840
The snacks I made today

00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:19.880
are all your favorite.

00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.640
I'll get you some.

00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:25.240
You're late.

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:30.040
I don't think it's just snacks.

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:31.720
What is it this time?

00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:34.320
Do you know

00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:36.120
what's going on in the library?

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.640
Why do you ask about the library?

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:41.480
My dad asked me to find something.

00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.080
They are all Japanese now.

00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:45.520
That's why I'm here to ask you.

00:29:45.560 --> 00:29:46.600
What's going on?

00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:51.960
Tell me.

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.760
Are you going to cause trouble again?

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:54.840
Oh.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.520
Don't worry. The Japanese can't catch me.

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:03.360
I usually go there during the day.

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.840
They seem to rest at night.

00:30:08.360 --> 00:30:09.120
What about the backyard?

00:30:09.120 --> 00:30:09.960
The woodshed in the backyard.

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.280
The Japanese seem to be in the front yard.

00:30:14.120 --> 00:30:15.480
There seems to be no one in the woodshed.

00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000
Who's outside?

00:30:18.480 --> 00:30:19.160
Mr. Tang.

00:30:19.200 --> 00:30:19.720
I'm leaving.

00:30:19.920 --> 00:30:20.560
Eat it while it's hot.

00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:21.480
Don't make trouble.

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:21.800
Don't worry.

00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:21.880
Mr. Wang,

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.720
Please support us.

00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:24.720
Sure.

00:31:24.800 --> 00:31:25.520
Let's have a drink.

00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:28.080
Good evening.

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:29.480
I've prepared a song for you.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.360
Rose, Rose, I love you.

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:31.720
I hope you like it.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:41.480
Rose. Rose is the most delicate.

00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:45.840
Rose is the most beautiful.

00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:50.040
The long summer blooms on the branches.

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:53.520
Rose, Rose, I love you.

00:31:53.520 --> 00:31:53.960
Sir.

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:54.800
Enjoy.

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:00.920
Please enjoy.

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:03.520
Sir.

00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.760
I want to know

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:08.640
about this girl here.

00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:11.640
Well...

00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:14.640
Go ahead.

00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:15.480
Okay.

00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:22.840
Look carefully.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:24.320
Say it clearly.

00:32:25.160 --> 00:32:25.600
Sir.

00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:29.480
This girl doesn't belong here.

00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:32.720
She's only been here once or twice.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:34.760
One or two.

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:37.120
But everything shows that

00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.800
this girl

00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:40.320
a dancer here.

00:32:44.640 --> 00:32:45.640
Coming.

00:32:47.640 --> 00:32:49.160
Someone went to my room today.

00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.000
They're all professional.

00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:52.560
They didn't lose anything.

00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.640
I guess the Japanese are checking the situation.

00:32:57.760 --> 00:32:59.480
Have you reported to station 21?

00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:04.640
I've been here for more than four years.

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:06.600
It can't be wrong.

00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:07.640
One or two at most.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.480
Who does she have more contact with?

00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:15.920
Don't look that way.

00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.280
I think you're being targeted.

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:22.320
It's leaking.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:24.520
Are they investigating Miss Ye?

00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:28.320
They are in danger.

00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:29.200
We have to block them.

00:33:30.520 --> 00:33:30.640
Okay.

00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:33.840
Follow those two newcomers.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.000
I'll take care of this.

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:38.960
Go.

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:51.360
That one.

00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:00.320
What's going on?

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:01.160
Excuse me.

00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:08.320
Two more.

00:34:08.719 --> 00:34:09.199
Got it.

00:35:35.200 --> 00:35:36.040
The two brothers

00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.240
The two brothers in the dance hall

00:35:37.240 --> 00:35:38.800
were killed by a container.

00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:41.080
What did you say?

00:35:41.720 --> 00:35:42.600
Who did this?

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:44.640
I don't know if it was an accident or an accident.

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:45.920
I've sent someone

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:47.160
the owner of the warehouse.

00:35:47.680 --> 00:35:48.040
But

00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:50.760
we haven't found out his background yet.

00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:52.480
It was the delivery time.

00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:53.200
So,

00:35:53.200 --> 00:35:54.880
they might have come to the wrong place

00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:56.240
at the wrong time.

00:35:56.920 --> 00:35:58.120
What coincidence?

00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:02.480
Guktae Ballroom is really strange.

00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:05.480
We have many enemies in Shanghai.

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:07.800
We don't know who did it yet.

00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:08.760
Of course,

00:36:08.760 --> 00:36:10.880
we can't rule out the dance hall.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.560
Send someone to watch.

00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:15.840
at the dance hall.

00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.840
Report to me if anything happens.

00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:21.200
Send a telegram to Airlines 6.

00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:22.960
to explain the situation.

00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:37.840
Sir.

00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:49.480
IShang Apartment sent someone to the dance hall of Guotai.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:50.320
The people who investigated Ye Biying

00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:54.600
didn't come back.

00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:56.920
There are indeed some problems.

00:36:57.560 --> 00:36:58.000
Right?

00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:01.520
they found out something

00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:03.640
They were killed.

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:06.600
We just sent a telegram.

00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:07.560
Then something happened.

00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:11.040
It seems that place is very sensitive.

00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:13.920
The biggest possibility is what they found.

00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:16.480
Send another telegram.

00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:17.520
Please send someone

00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.560
to continue the investigation.

00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.920
This woman has a big problem.

00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:23.800
Let's focus on Tan Jiawan.

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:26.320
From now on,

00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:27.640
send more men.

00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:29.760
I need to know her daily movements.

00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:32.360
Irigami.

00:37:32.480 --> 00:37:32.800
Yes.

00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:35.920
Check the nurse named Tang as soon as possible.

00:37:39.040 --> 00:37:40.120
I'm very willing to help.

00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:41.480
Irigami.

00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:44.000
Don't go too far.

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:47.480
Of course.

00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.920
The gate of the library is right

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:56.920
a second-floor attic.

00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:59.040
The attic is where they receive guests.

00:37:59.640 --> 00:38:01.680
There were many ghosts in the yard during the day.

00:38:01.880 --> 00:38:02.880
They queued up here.

00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.320
The stairs are full of people.

00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.480
So it can only be quiet at night.

00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:08.040
Where is the secret room?

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.200
In the woodshed behind the academy.

00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.320
Academy?

00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:13.760
This used to be an academy.

00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:15.480
My father invested

00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:16.640
to build a school

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.280
for the children on the island.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.280
The secret room inside is also big.

00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:22.480
It's for kids to avoid robbers

00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:23.240
to avoid the typhoon.

00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:25.680
Who else knows

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:26.800
knows this place?

00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:28.520
Not many.

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:29.000
Don't worry.

00:38:30.800 --> 00:38:31.080
Oh.

00:38:31.360 --> 00:38:32.760
I've seen this woodshed

00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.000
It's full of

00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.320
the tables and chairs used in school.

00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.760
There are spider webs on the wall.

00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:39.920
I don't think anyone has been there.

00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:42.000
So I think the secret room is also safe.

00:38:42.080 --> 00:38:43.000
Except the gate,

00:38:43.200 --> 00:38:44.320
where else can we get in?

00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:45.680
Here.

00:38:46.120 --> 00:38:46.600
There's a hole.

00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.520
We can enter the wood room through this hole.

00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:49.960
But

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.000
we can see this house directly.

00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:53.680
So we can't move during the day.

00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:56.600
Dad is smart.

00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:58.160
This is the best place.

00:39:00.720 --> 00:39:01.920
Oshimahao can't find Americans.

00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:03.120
I won't let this slide.

00:39:03.520 --> 00:39:04.920
That's why

00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:08.360
The key is

00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:09.520
to the library.

00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:11.000
I can't go during the day.

00:39:11.200 --> 00:39:12.040
We can only act at night.

00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.480
What should we do now?

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:16.480
This is the Navy Base.

00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:18.560
We need to find a Navy uniform for the Major.

00:39:19.280 --> 00:39:20.080
Where are we going?

00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:24.120
The library.

00:39:56.880 --> 00:39:57.880
This is the Navy base.

00:39:58.600 --> 00:39:59.880
He can't go anywhere

00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:00.720
he can't go anywhere.

00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:38.560
Colonel.

00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:42.120
The officer serves on Sunday.

00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:43.960
It’s him.

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.040
who reported you for nothing?

00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:52.680
How dare you report anyone?

00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:54.240
Are you tired of living?

00:40:55.640 --> 00:40:56.200
I'm sorry.

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:58.160
Please forgive me.

00:40:59.160 --> 00:40:59.840
What are you looking at?

00:40:59.840 --> 00:41:00.480
Turn around.

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.320
Don't you want to vent your anger?

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:06.840
I'll leave it to you.

00:41:11.920 --> 00:41:12.240
Tell me.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:13.720
Why did you report me?

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.160
Sorry, Miss.

00:41:16.600 --> 00:41:17.280
It's because...

00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:18.760
I accidentally saw it.

00:41:18.760 --> 00:41:19.240
A gun.

00:41:20.640 --> 00:41:21.680
If you see a gun, report me.

00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:22.880
Are you blind?

00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:24.600
Tell me.

00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:25.680
If you report me,

00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:27.040
How much did the Police Brigade give you?

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.360
No.

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:30.720
Are you trying to harm me?

00:41:46.800 --> 00:41:47.640
You want to frame me, right?

00:41:48.560 --> 00:41:49.480
Who ordered you?

00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:51.880
I won't tell you.

00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:54.280
Do you know what this place is?

00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:55.880
This is where kids study.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:57.080
You made it like this.

00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.880
You're disgusting.

00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.200
Disgusting.

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:00.960
I'm sorry.

00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:02.800
Get out of here!

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:04.120
I'll kill you!

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:05.280
I'll kill you!

00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:11.200
If this happens again,

00:42:12.120 --> 00:42:13.560
I'll shoot you to death.

00:42:27.760 --> 00:42:28.560
Let go of me!

00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:31.080
Let go of me!
