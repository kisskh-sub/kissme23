00:02:19.493 --> 00:02:20.750
if i m am lucky

00:02:21.756 --> 00:02:23.906

00:02:27.725 --> 00:02:29.589
try to think of something
during the operation

00:02:30.010 --> 00:02:31.113
to stay awak

00:02:34.653 --> 00:02:35.660
like what?

00:02:36.335 --> 00:02:37.382
anything

00:02:39.033 --> 00:02:40.057
anything

00:02:40.772 --> 00:02:42.238
that's a non answer

00:02:42.563 --> 00:02:44.031
you might as well tell me not to ask

00:02:45.317 --> 00:02:47.517
for people in this operating room

00:02:48.309 --> 00:02:50.394
other than the tumor in my brain

00:02:50.966 --> 00:02:51.973
anything else

00:02:52.728 --> 00:02:54.315
is not wrote mentioning

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:55.355
it's ready

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.394

the result come back fine

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:55.240
as for the visions you've been seeing

00:03:55.264 --> 00:03:56.351
be it memory

00:03:56.446 --> 00:03:57.566
or premonition

00:03:57.756 --> 00:03:59.745
as long as they don't affect your life now

00:03:59.786 --> 00:04:00.793
don't mind them

00:04:00.904 --> 00:04:02.244
two years since the surgery

00:04:02.595 --> 00:04:04.436
I've heard such words a million times

00:04:05.325 --> 00:04:07.339
yet, it won't make the
hallucinations go away

00:04:08.067 --> 00:04:09.916
nor can it change my life

00:04:12.718 --> 00:04:13.757
guess I'm done here

00:04:15.242 --> 00:04:16.303
I'll wait outside

00:04:16.477 --> 00:04:17.492
what the...

00:04:17.517 --> 00:04:18.517
he's just...

00:04:18.542 --> 00:04:19.542
it's alright

00:04:19.629 --> 00:04:20.700
kids his age

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:22.636
even without the disease

00:04:22.708 --> 00:04:23.882
would act rebellious

00:04:24.302 --> 00:04:26.246
he should hang out with
his friends more often

00:04:26.303 --> 00:04:28.128
that's the thing, he has no friends

00:04:28.417 --> 00:04:29.557
now that he's suspended

00:04:29.645 --> 00:04:31.601
he doesn't even talk to his old classmates

00:04:32.038 --> 00:04:33.838
are you in Xiao Wu's group?

00:04:33.941 --> 00:04:34.941
yeah

00:04:34.966 --> 00:04:36.442
Xiao Wu is such a nice guy

00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:38.012
he comes visit us all the time

00:04:38.496 --> 00:04:40.535
still, it'd be easier to
make a fish climb a tree

00:04:40.678 --> 00:04:42.178
than to get that kid to do activities

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.740
kid

00:04:43.765 --> 00:04:44.766
come here

00:04:44.791 --> 00:04:45.791
food's ready

00:04:46.138 --> 00:04:47.145
sit straight

00:04:47.479 --> 00:04:48.624
here, open your mouth

00:04:49.203 --> 00:04:50.203
there you go

00:04:50.228 --> 00:04:51.228
good girl

00:04:51.425 --> 00:04:52.632
daddy, you have some too

00:04:52.862 --> 00:04:55.338
the nurses lady said you don't eat enough

00:04:55.648 --> 00:04:57.168
what does she know?

00:04:57.462 --> 00:04:58.462
here

00:04:59.034 --> 00:05:00.993
actually, I just ate

00:05:01.755 --> 00:05:03.144
beef stew with rice

00:05:03.899 --> 00:05:06.025
I want beef stew too

00:05:06.476 --> 00:05:07.769
tell you what, after the checkup

00:05:07.794 --> 00:05:09.056
I'll take you to dinner tonight

00:05:09.081 --> 00:05:10.081
how does that sound?

00:05:10.106 --> 00:05:11.106
great

00:05:11.131 --> 00:05:12.682
ok, now
take a bit bite

00:05:17.403 --> 00:05:18.403
hi there

00:05:19.379 --> 00:05:20.579
receipt, please

00:05:21.871 --> 00:05:23.497
five more yuan for the overtime

00:05:24.162 --> 00:05:25.605
it's just five minutes, kiddo

00:05:25.645 --> 00:05:26.731
and i don't need no receipt

00:05:26.756 --> 00:05:27.771
it's still overtime

00:05:27.883 --> 00:05:29.057
it's not like I haven't tried

00:05:29.082 --> 00:05:30.374
but my car before me was drawing

00:05:30.399 --> 00:05:31.406
tell it the computer

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:32.799
now you're just
being unreasonable

00:05:32.824 --> 00:05:35.029
why should I pay the
price for someone else's slacking?

00:05:35.077 --> 00:05:36.077
meet my mom

00:05:36.323 --> 00:05:39.410
اan accountant who gave up
her career to take care of me

00:05:40.132 --> 00:05:42.019
and has spent half of
her lifetime saving money

00:05:42.044 --> 00:05:43.136
i'm not out of cash

00:05:43.161 --> 00:05:44.161
see?

00:05:44.186 --> 00:05:45.208
pay with your phone then

00:05:51.347 --> 00:05:52.809
there's no signal here

00:05:52.849 --> 00:05:53.849
no signal

00:05:53.874 --> 00:05:54.874
see?
it works fine

00:05:54.899 --> 00:05:55.939
no
why you...

00:05:56.932 --> 00:05:58.094
it doesn't

00:05:58.657 --> 00:05:59.657
never mind

00:05:59.682 --> 00:06:00.682
just go

00:06:00.707 --> 00:06:01.707
thank you

00:06:05.658 --> 00:06:07.039
how about that for mommy huh?

00:06:07.594 --> 00:06:09.403
you've wasted a good 3 minutes
and 30 seconds

00:06:09.708 --> 00:06:10.708
bravo

00:06:12.354 --> 00:06:13.874
thirty days a month

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:15.640
167 hours of worktime

00:06:15.665 --> 00:06:16.942
that's 10020 minutes in total

00:06:17.545 --> 00:06:18.910
i make 5500 a month

00:06:18.935 --> 00:06:20.480
that's 54 cents per minute

00:06:20.505 --> 00:06:23.994
for three and half minutes. it's 1.89 yuan

00:06:24.637 --> 00:06:26.740
and i just made five

00:06:29.385 --> 00:06:30.693
i'm a cancer patient, hello?

00:06:30.718 --> 00:06:32.932
how many three and a half minutes
do you think i have?

00:06:32.957 --> 00:06:34.210
WERE, you were a cancer patient

00:06:35.741 --> 00:06:37.259
didn't you hear what the doctor said?

00:06:37.284 --> 00:06:38.904
the recurrence rate is extremely low

00:06:43.219 --> 00:06:44.223
Yihang,food's ready

00:06:44.248 --> 00:06:45.248
-come on
-sure

00:06:59.142 --> 00:07:00.148
this is my dad

00:07:00.616 --> 00:07:02.751
an average office worker in
an average company

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:05.814
he picked up sculpting since i got sick

00:07:06.585 --> 00:07:07.836
his works, let's just say

00:07:07.875 --> 00:07:10.757
swing violently between master pieces
and car crash scenes

00:07:11.375 --> 00:07:14.669
trying to match the genius of
mother nature all by himself

00:07:20.149 --> 00:07:21.997
one turnip costs three yuan now
you know that?

00:07:22.482 --> 00:07:23.713
the turnip may cost just three

00:07:23.738 --> 00:07:25.508
but the time and effort i put in it

00:07:25.549 --> 00:07:28.008
are worth way more than that

00:07:28.452 --> 00:07:29.929
plus the aesthetics and thought

00:07:29.954 --> 00:07:31.692
it's called studying the nature of things

00:07:31.717 --> 00:07:32.984
and what exactly did you learn?

00:07:34.413 --> 00:07:36.539
that carrots contain
less water than turnips

00:07:36.833 --> 00:07:38.553
and the fibers are too rough to carve with

00:07:38.736 --> 00:07:39.981
enough of this nonsense

00:07:40.482 --> 00:07:41.513
if only our son were

00:07:41.545 --> 00:07:42.982
half as talkative as you are

00:07:49.136 --> 00:07:50.142
i'm done

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.270
wait

00:07:51.669 --> 00:07:53.474
did you hear what the doctor said today?

00:07:53.591 --> 00:07:55.204
stop playing on your phone all the time

00:07:55.229 --> 00:07:56.639
go out and make some friends

00:07:59.833 --> 00:08:00.833
hi

00:08:00.865 --> 00:08:02.032
my name's Wei Yihang

00:08:02.547 --> 00:08:03.547
that's good

00:08:03.670 --> 00:08:04.670
and then?

00:08:05.181 --> 00:08:07.402
do you want to see my brain tumor biopsy?

00:08:15.068 --> 00:08:16.093
take this for me

00:08:16.996 --> 00:08:18.004
Xiao Wu is here

00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:19.037
Mrs.Wei, watch out

00:08:24.742 --> 00:08:25.742
Wu Xiaomei

00:08:26.074 --> 00:08:28.281
he owns a wig shop across
the tumor hospital

00:08:28.931 --> 00:08:30.599
and a support group for cancer patients

00:08:30.678 --> 00:08:32.810
he is the ultimate chicken-soup-for
the-soul believer

00:08:33.175 --> 00:08:34.722
and a self-claimed friend of mine

00:08:34.747 --> 00:08:36.986
and, in secret
my mom's number one spy

00:08:37.011 --> 00:08:38.051
don't mind me

00:08:39.712 --> 00:08:40.714
go make some tea

00:08:43.023 --> 00:08:44.658
you didn't reply to my WeChat messages

00:08:46.019 --> 00:08:47.429
it's A-Kou's memorial service

00:08:48.041 --> 00:08:49.041
you must go

00:08:49.805 --> 00:08:50.829
did you wash your hands?

00:08:54.930 --> 00:08:55.930
A-Kou

00:08:55.955 --> 00:08:56.963
you knew her

00:08:57.404 --> 00:08:58.404
the one who

00:08:58.429 --> 00:08:59.881
bought that big wavy wig at my shop?

00:09:01.159 --> 00:09:02.279
the cosplayer?

00:09:02.819 --> 00:09:03.859
we had a deal

00:09:04.016 --> 00:09:05.493
she didn't want it to be too serious

00:09:05.747 --> 00:09:07.120
so it's going to be a cos party

00:09:07.604 --> 00:09:08.804
and a fancy one

00:09:09.833 --> 00:09:11.344
i know nothing about cosplay

00:09:12.042 --> 00:09:13.062
i'll get you wig

00:09:13.269 --> 00:09:14.309
jut put it on

00:09:14.761 --> 00:09:15.975
and play along

00:09:17.918 --> 00:09:19.255
- alright?
- he'll go

00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:20.280
absolutely

00:09:20.763 --> 00:09:21.763
never mind him

00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.113
come here and have some tea

00:09:24.763 --> 00:09:25.763
Xiao Wu

00:09:25.788 --> 00:09:26.850
tell me something

00:09:26.958 --> 00:09:28.255
how did it happen with the girl?

00:09:30.097 --> 00:09:31.097
it spread

00:09:33.073 --> 00:09:34.714
she suffered a lot, that one, didn't she?

00:09:34.867 --> 00:09:35.867
she sure did

00:09:38.635 --> 00:09:39.635
i thought

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:41.212
it was removed

00:09:41.237 --> 00:09:43.204
xiao wu just said, it spread

00:09:52.329 --> 00:09:53.407
memories

00:09:53.432 --> 00:09:54.686
or fantasies

00:09:55.478 --> 00:09:56.660
past

00:09:56.685 --> 00:09:58.049
or the future

00:09:58.597 --> 00:10:00.763
i can always see the images

00:10:01.557 --> 00:10:04.473
they told me it's
just hallucination induced by the surgery

00:10:04.989 --> 00:10:06.654
but i'm certain that

00:10:06.679 --> 00:10:08.956
something important must be waiting for me

00:10:09.542 --> 00:10:12.003
there is place i need to be

00:10:12.956 --> 00:10:15.126
it's just, before i can prove any of that

00:10:15.309 --> 00:10:16.444
i have to try and

00:10:17.729 --> 00:10:19.087
be normal

00:10:29.220 --> 00:10:31.013

it's not what you think

00:16:52.085 --> 00:16:53.093
i've been there

00:16:53.434 --> 00:16:54.434

00:17:07.581 --> 00:17:08.581

bitter and puckery

00:17:10.490 --> 00:17:11.891
that's it for today

00:17:13.069 --> 00:17:14.740
thank you guys

00:17:16.502 --> 00:17:17.716
tomorrow at the group session

00:17:17.750 --> 00:17:19.219
Mr. Zhang Hesong will give a lecture

00:17:19.536 --> 00:17:22.060
which i begged him to do with a dozen IMs

00:17:22.750 --> 00:17:24.536
so please don't be late

00:17:32.108 --> 00:17:33.108
boring

00:17:56.417 --> 00:17:57.581
i once said

00:17:59.081 --> 00:18:00.081
a life

00:18:00.106 --> 00:18:01.859
full of different flavors

00:18:02.741 --> 00:18:05.040
is what makes us fearless

00:18:06.943 --> 00:18:08.341
many people have told me that

00:18:08.943 --> 00:18:09.944
look who's here

00:18:09.969 --> 00:18:11.278
first activity, i suppose?

00:18:11.357 --> 00:18:12.357
let's go

00:18:12.702 --> 00:18:14.106
and every time i hear that

00:18:14.214 --> 00:18:15.214
i feel awkward

00:18:15.463 --> 00:18:17.051
surely i don't deserve such compliment

00:18:17.432 --> 00:18:19.820
i just love to come here
and share with everyone

00:18:20.045 --> 00:18:22.142
my take on the wisdom of life

00:18:22.569 --> 00:18:23.569
meanwhile

00:18:23.594 --> 00:18:26.128
i'm sure i'll also learn something

00:18:26.250 --> 00:18:27.372
from the stories you share

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:31.570
flavor number one

00:18:32.087 --> 00:18:33.087
sweet

00:18:33.562 --> 00:18:34.564
- i'll go
- please do

00:18:37.405 --> 00:18:38.406
i'm Yang

00:18:38.864 --> 00:18:40.070
and i've been on chemo forever

00:18:41.083 --> 00:18:42.427
if there's one thing i've learned

00:18:43.017 --> 00:18:44.118
in years of hospitalization

00:18:44.412 --> 00:18:45.570
it is my poker skill

00:18:45.957 --> 00:18:46.968
which has become awesome

00:18:48.095 --> 00:18:49.095
what i got

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:51.168
is a malignant bone tumor

00:18:51.386 --> 00:18:53.572
also known as bone cancer

00:18:53.778 --> 00:18:54.778
i heard that

00:18:54.803 --> 00:18:56.525
out of every hundred breast cencer patients

00:18:56.557 --> 00:18:57.862
one is male

00:18:58.211 --> 00:18:59.227
and i was the one

00:19:00.803 --> 00:19:01.811
the calligraply

00:19:01.836 --> 00:19:02.838
anyone interested

00:19:02.863 --> 00:19:03.868
in keeping it?

00:19:04.329 --> 00:19:05.345
for just one hundred yuan

00:19:05.734 --> 00:19:06.908
you'll also get

00:19:06.933 --> 00:19:09.615
a book with my autograph

00:19:09.775 --> 00:19:11.776
i'll take the calligraphy

00:19:12.181 --> 00:19:13.181
there you go

00:19:16.966 --> 00:19:17.966
thank you

00:19:17.991 --> 00:19:19.704
i love the quote on the back cover

00:19:19.729 --> 00:19:20.729
which one?

00:19:20.754 --> 00:19:22.252
always hope for a miracle

00:19:23.189 --> 00:19:25.724
while learning to live in peace
with the cancer

00:19:26.153 --> 00:19:27.247
bravo

00:19:28.255 --> 00:19:29.255
everything

00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:30.541
will defintely

00:19:30.796 --> 00:19:31.796
get better

00:19:32.408 --> 00:19:33.421
in your life

00:19:33.446 --> 00:19:34.812
fantastic

00:19:35.853 --> 00:19:37.241
young man, i've been watching you

00:19:37.921 --> 00:19:39.408
you have something to say, don't you?

00:19:40.439 --> 00:19:41.837
let's give him a round of applause

00:19:48.557 --> 00:19:50.025
no one has spoken on "sour" yet

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:51.810
step forward

00:19:56.579 --> 00:19:58.626
you guys don't seriously
believe in this, do you?

00:19:59.878 --> 00:20:02.645
you think he really cares
about the "flavors" of your life?

00:20:04.327 --> 00:20:06.007
hope for a miracle...

00:20:06.967 --> 00:20:08.487
there is no miracle

00:20:11.917 --> 00:20:13.277
to me the only miracle would be

00:20:13.563 --> 00:20:15.503
to wake up and find that none
of this exists

00:20:15.915 --> 00:20:17.788
that i never had a tumor

00:20:18.472 --> 00:20:20.480
so my family don't have
to live a thrifty life

00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:23.408
or i don't toss and turn in bed
all night because of the pain

00:20:23.436 --> 00:20:24.436
son

00:20:24.969 --> 00:20:26.499
this is a group for cancer patients

00:20:26.752 --> 00:20:28.396
we're supposed to encourage each other

00:20:28.435 --> 00:20:30.270
why you had to come and
say things like that?

00:20:30.602 --> 00:20:33.113
if encouraging each other could kill cancer

00:20:33.644 --> 00:20:35.224
i'd be the first to sign up

00:20:36.136 --> 00:20:37.803
and where did you even find this guy

00:20:38.216 --> 00:20:39.565
who is clearly a fraud

00:20:44.564 --> 00:20:45.770
this is outrageous

00:20:46.151 --> 00:20:48.085
i just want to look healthier

00:20:48.161 --> 00:20:49.161
is that wrong?

00:20:49.479 --> 00:20:51.212
i just want to look normal

00:20:51.263 --> 00:20:52.383
is that wrong?

00:20:53.315 --> 00:20:54.515
pain is private

00:20:54.976 --> 00:20:56.287
no need to show it to everybody

00:20:56.637 --> 00:20:58.374
let alone pretending to be normal

00:21:02.361 --> 00:21:03.361
Wei Yihang

00:21:03.654 --> 00:21:04.656
so, for you, cancer

00:21:04.681 --> 00:21:06.714
is nothing but an excuse to act crazy?

00:21:06.936 --> 00:21:08.708
as little as you care
about others' feelings

00:21:08.733 --> 00:21:10.458
you certainly made an effort to look normal

00:21:10.458 --> 00:21:12.458
why don't you live up to your words

00:21:12.585 --> 00:21:13.984
and take off thet outfit?

00:21:14.111 --> 00:21:15.845
now you're just trying to picka fight

00:21:15.971 --> 00:21:17.241
i dare you to do it

00:21:19.299 --> 00:21:20.299
guys, guys

00:21:20.616 --> 00:21:21.897
Yihang didn't mean any of that

00:21:21.930 --> 00:21:23.105
he's just a kid

00:21:23.177 --> 00:21:24.591
Mr. Zhang
why don't you carry on?

00:21:24.670 --> 00:21:25.678
go

00:21:30.626 --> 00:21:31.626
No, No, No

00:21:35.443 --> 00:21:36.443
are you done?

00:21:55.974 --> 00:21:56.982
should i continue?

00:22:16.820 --> 00:22:17.820
welcome home

00:22:17.983 --> 00:22:19.047
how was it?

00:22:21.974 --> 00:22:23.014
watch the pan

00:22:27.336 --> 00:22:28.336
Mrs

00:22:28.361 --> 00:22:31.100
hey you, stop pinching it or
i might as well give it to you for free

00:22:31.125 --> 00:22:32.770
i have to, look how rotten it is

00:22:33.088 --> 00:22:34.162
and these should be free

00:22:34.224 --> 00:22:35.630
you're selling rotten vegetables

00:22:35.829 --> 00:22:37.480
here
weight it

00:22:45.207 --> 00:22:46.636
- hello?
- Wei Yihang?

00:22:47.630 --> 00:22:49.204
how come you didn't show up today?

00:22:49.925 --> 00:22:50.928
who is this?

00:22:51.044 --> 00:22:52.044
it's me, Ma Xiaoyuan

00:22:54.050 --> 00:22:55.170
do i know you?

00:22:55.232 --> 00:22:57.227
the girl whoasked you
to take off your clothes?

00:23:00.726 --> 00:23:01.743
what do you want?

00:23:02.107 --> 00:23:03.107
the thing is

00:23:03.132 --> 00:23:05.536
a friend of mine was at
Master Zhang's lecture the other day

00:23:05.561 --> 00:23:07.190
he heard your speech
and was intrigued

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.113
they're making this documentary on cancer

00:23:09.138 --> 00:23:11.530
_ he was wondering if you'd do an interview
_ not interested

00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:13.014
please, do me a favor

00:23:13.331 --> 00:23:15.738
don't blow off big opportunities
because of our stupid fight

00:23:16.069 --> 00:23:17.963
this documentary could really
make a difference

00:23:17.988 --> 00:23:18.988
hold on

00:23:19.043 --> 00:23:22.111
it was not just a fight
call it whatever you like

00:23:22.608 --> 00:23:24.922
i'll meet you at your place
tomorrow at three

00:23:26.577 --> 00:23:28.378
i friended you on WeChat
accept it

00:23:29.037 --> 00:23:30.259
but I haven't told you....

00:23:30.819 --> 00:23:31.819
hello?

00:23:56.110 --> 00:23:57.118
no one

00:23:57.289 --> 00:23:59.185
is an island

00:23:59.656 --> 00:24:00.799
the illness

00:24:00.883 --> 00:24:03.545
may have kept us further apart

00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.127
but sharing and mutual help

00:24:06.271 --> 00:24:09.059
are what connect us

00:24:10.086 --> 00:24:11.466
we must learn to

00:24:11.628 --> 00:24:13.565
live in place with the cancer

00:24:13.868 --> 00:24:15.020
excuse me

00:24:15.084 --> 00:24:16.084
can we stop?

00:24:26.471 --> 00:24:27.471
don't be nervous

00:24:27.739 --> 00:24:28.739
no pressure

00:24:28.886 --> 00:24:30.158
just speak your mind

00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:32.360
that's what i did

00:24:33.375 --> 00:24:35.055
that's what everyone says

00:24:35.284 --> 00:24:36.942
just repeat your speech

00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:38.665
at the session the other day

00:24:41.875 --> 00:24:42.875
i see

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:44.986
no wonder you came to me

00:24:45.869 --> 00:24:47.680
I am a negative example

00:24:48.045 --> 00:24:49.338
negative schmegative

00:24:49.694 --> 00:24:52.243
different voices should be heard from
cancer fighters

00:24:52.918 --> 00:24:53.933
I'm not fighter

00:24:54.375 --> 00:24:55.375
no voice

00:24:55.725 --> 00:24:56.725
ask them to leave

00:25:01.396 --> 00:25:02.658
I know you like this

00:25:02.953 --> 00:25:05.261
this morning I went to a Troy shop
and bought it for you

00:25:12.238 --> 00:25:13.436
come on, help me out here

00:25:14.030 --> 00:25:15.118
Ma Xiaoyuan

00:25:16.071 --> 00:25:17.652
are you freaking kidding me?

00:25:42.924 --> 00:25:45.014
now, think of this as a token of our
implacable feud

00:25:45.039 --> 00:25:46.802
drink it up and I'll help you

00:25:49.458 --> 00:25:50.820
you watched my live streaming

00:25:53.208 --> 00:25:54.408
not on purpose

00:25:54.774 --> 00:25:56.043
and you followed me on Weibo

00:25:57.028 --> 00:25:58.028
I ...

00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:01.103
that's how you knew i invited Master Zhang

00:26:10.187 --> 00:26:11.209
Lao Sun

00:26:11.463 --> 00:26:12.463
let's go

00:26:12.488 --> 00:26:13.488
Okey

00:26:14.104 --> 00:26:15.907
sorry for the trouble, Mrs Wei

00:26:15.978 --> 00:26:17.260
it's ok, no trouble

00:26:17.319 --> 00:26:18.434
you're done filming?

00:26:48.616 --> 00:26:51.161
check out my stream

00:27:07.412 --> 00:27:09.409
logged on yet?

00:27:09.900 --> 00:27:10.900
yep

00:27:16.748 --> 00:27:17.748
ketchup

00:27:19.849 --> 00:27:20.849
yogurt

00:27:22.212 --> 00:27:23.212
leek flower

00:27:25.062 --> 00:27:26.102
white vinegar

00:27:27.352 --> 00:27:28.370
vintage vinegar

00:27:30.458 --> 00:27:32.192
i did something dumb today

00:27:32.714 --> 00:27:34.571
i neglected the feeling of a fellow member

00:27:34.968 --> 00:27:36.547
and it's only fair that i get punished

00:27:36.572 --> 00:27:37.572
this implacable feud

00:27:37.595 --> 00:27:38.595
cheers

00:28:01.755 --> 00:28:03.400
I'm gonna go puke a little
bye everyone

00:28:06.899 --> 00:28:08.690
you alright?

00:28:09.581 --> 00:28:11.621
still mad?

00:28:14.998 --> 00:28:17.045
uh huh

00:28:21.194 --> 00:28:23.475
dinner tomorrow? my treat

00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.882
hi, may I speak to Ma Xiaoyuan?

00:28:46.972 --> 00:28:48.368
excuse me, may i ask

00:28:48.748 --> 00:28:50.330
if Ma Xiaoyuan's home?

00:28:51.491 --> 00:28:52.675
Xu Dong

00:28:54.341 --> 00:28:55.341
you moved

00:28:55.366 --> 00:28:56.366
i didn't, boss

00:28:56.422 --> 00:28:58.116
you go paint those two car doors later

00:28:58.141 --> 00:28:59.141
not me

00:28:59.166 --> 00:29:00.584
i really didn't move, boss

00:29:00.743 --> 00:29:01.943
everyone saw it

00:29:01.958 --> 00:29:03.071
Guangzi
did he move?

00:29:03.119 --> 00:29:04.753
yes
I totally saw it

00:29:04.906 --> 00:29:05.906
you're the man, boss

00:29:05.931 --> 00:29:07.051
you did
you definitely moved

00:29:07.844 --> 00:29:09.989
don't take a bit if you can't lose

00:29:10.985 --> 00:29:12.425
did you set me up?

00:29:12.525 --> 00:29:13.525
you guys

00:29:13.642 --> 00:29:14.642
cut it out

00:29:14.975 --> 00:29:16.601
all you do is fooling around

00:29:16.689 --> 00:29:17.696
go do some work

00:29:17.721 --> 00:29:19.701
the olders are not getting
handled by themselves

00:29:21.765 --> 00:29:23.045
you still smoke?

00:29:24.586 --> 00:29:25.713
first one today

00:29:32.969 --> 00:29:33.969
Lao Ma

00:29:34.309 --> 00:29:36.309
when are you going to grow up?

00:29:38.043 --> 00:29:39.566
wait here, I'll go take a shower

00:29:46.075 --> 00:29:47.392
go wait in my office

00:29:50.098 --> 00:29:52.713
how did you two know each other?

00:29:54.437 --> 00:29:55.637
we're both sick

00:29:58.105 --> 00:29:59.232
what do you have?

00:30:00.083 --> 00:30:01.946
something's wrong with my brain

00:30:02.718 --> 00:30:03.970
that's no big deal

00:30:04.576 --> 00:30:07.005
are you Ma Xiaoyuan's dad?

00:30:07.536 --> 00:30:08.536
what?

00:30:08.561 --> 00:30:09.928
do i not look like a dad?

00:30:11.406 --> 00:30:12.406
you do

00:30:14.125 --> 00:30:16.392
so, what do you think of Xiaoyuan?

00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000
I think

00:30:20.750 --> 00:30:21.750
she's nice

00:30:24.321 --> 00:30:25.321
good

00:30:25.346 --> 00:30:27.028
you're a terrible liar

00:30:27.708 --> 00:30:28.966
I got nothing to worry then

00:30:29.769 --> 00:30:30.769
go

00:30:31.328 --> 00:30:32.848
put this up outside

00:30:37.303 --> 00:30:38.870
with what?

00:30:42.013 --> 00:30:43.373
check your pocket

00:30:51.522 --> 00:30:52.522
magic

00:30:59.833 --> 00:31:00.833
Wei Yihang

00:31:00.858 --> 00:31:01.858
up here

00:31:14.986 --> 00:31:16.232
sit wherever you like

00:31:27.747 --> 00:31:30.478
your hair's not falling off?

00:31:31.555 --> 00:31:32.801
it's been more than ten years

00:31:32.826 --> 00:31:34.142
they've grown back

00:31:35.269 --> 00:31:36.936
so, you're fine now?

00:31:38.803 --> 00:31:41.144
my head hurts a little when it's cloudy

00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:42.941
and that's about it

00:31:43.484 --> 00:31:45.313
get myself checked on a
regular basis, though

00:31:49.872 --> 00:31:53.136
actually I don't believe
Master Zhang is that great

00:31:53.890 --> 00:31:55.851
but could it really be so bad to

00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.640
give people some hope?

00:31:58.674 --> 00:31:59.966
to alleviate the pain

00:32:00.092 --> 00:32:01.355
they'd even take morphine shots

00:32:01.566 --> 00:32:04.005
what's wrong with getting
some spiritual comfort?

00:32:05.277 --> 00:32:06.557
the way i see it

00:32:06.962 --> 00:32:10.412
whoever talks about the
truths of life everyday

00:32:10.989 --> 00:32:12.428
must be a liar

00:32:14.083 --> 00:32:15.753
Zhang is not what you think he is

00:32:16.015 --> 00:32:17.242
he's not a liar

00:32:17.450 --> 00:32:18.717
he's miserable man himself

00:32:19.083 --> 00:32:20.510
forget it, enough about him

00:32:25.201 --> 00:32:26.201
let's go

00:32:56.468 --> 00:32:58.672
that's the best one. give me
if you're not gonna eat it

00:33:00.727 --> 00:33:02.269
sir, two soda here

00:33:03.443 --> 00:33:04.468
Okey dokey

00:33:21.175 --> 00:33:22.175
well

00:33:23.212 --> 00:33:25.132
my mom said these types of
food cause cancer

00:33:25.426 --> 00:33:26.949
don't you already have it?

00:33:29.104 --> 00:33:30.852
nothing in this world

00:33:31.122 --> 00:33:32.844
is better than some beer with barbecue

00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:34.280
come on

00:33:34.305 --> 00:33:35.701
let's fight cancer with cancer

00:33:42.792 --> 00:33:44.339
where exactly are we going?

00:33:44.496 --> 00:33:46.061
I don't even see any street lamp ahead

00:33:46.403 --> 00:33:47.936
you'll know when we're there

00:33:52.688 --> 00:33:55.101
inside those walls is the wildlife park

00:33:55.337 --> 00:33:56.982
my dad and I came here often

00:33:58.486 --> 00:33:59.690
what about your mom?

00:33:59.746 --> 00:34:01.186
I hardly remember

00:34:01.394 --> 00:34:02.458
she died young

00:34:02.664 --> 00:34:04.490
thirty percent of cancer is inherited

00:34:04.552 --> 00:34:05.751
don't you know that?

00:34:11.091 --> 00:34:13.491
we can't see squat here at this hour

00:34:14.194 --> 00:34:15.314
we can listen

00:34:20.527 --> 00:34:22.424
they are inside, calm down

00:34:23.147 --> 00:34:24.178
I am calm

00:34:24.962 --> 00:34:25.962
it's chilly

00:34:31.667 --> 00:34:32.667
what is it?

00:34:33.319 --> 00:34:34.319
Zebra

00:34:35.341 --> 00:34:36.719
this is what zebra sounds like?

00:34:37.426 --> 00:34:39.235
no idea, I took a guess

00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:44.060
birds

00:34:44.085 --> 00:34:45.108
those are monkeys

00:34:45.402 --> 00:34:46.797
it's way past monkeys' bedtime now

00:34:46.822 --> 00:34:47.822
what about birds?

00:34:50.019 --> 00:34:51.019
a husky

00:34:51.313 --> 00:34:52.434
dude

00:34:52.479 --> 00:34:53.479
that's a wolf

00:34:54.910 --> 00:34:55.910
I know

00:34:56.343 --> 00:34:57.807
I was just messing with you

00:35:06.039 --> 00:35:07.039
sorry

00:35:07.093 --> 00:35:08.372
I had too much skewers

00:35:11.125 --> 00:35:12.405
can you do this?

00:35:18.792 --> 00:35:19.792
like this

00:35:27.936 --> 00:35:28.936
and this

00:35:41.368 --> 00:35:42.368
you know?

00:35:42.393 --> 00:35:43.393
I heard that

00:35:43.604 --> 00:35:45.240
after craniotomy

00:35:45.265 --> 00:35:47.247
some people can suddenly
speak several languages

00:35:47.272 --> 00:35:48.541
and all i can do this

00:35:49.391 --> 00:35:50.671
what can you do?

00:35:54.730 --> 00:35:56.611
i can see the future

00:36:05.167 --> 00:36:06.687
come on, seriously?

00:36:11.041 --> 00:36:13.456
ever since the craniotomy

00:36:14.574 --> 00:36:16.441
I kept dreaming of this lake

00:36:17.163 --> 00:36:18.363
and by the lake

00:36:19.069 --> 00:36:20.269
there is a girl

00:36:21.417 --> 00:36:23.803
I'd like to see her face clearly

00:36:24.504 --> 00:36:26.184
but the sun is so bright

00:36:26.528 --> 00:36:28.005
that my vision is compromised

00:36:28.188 --> 00:36:29.868
what you just described

00:36:30.401 --> 00:36:31.899
isn't necessarily the future

00:36:33.289 --> 00:36:34.583
it could be...

00:36:34.607 --> 00:36:35.972
don't tell me it's hallucinations

00:36:36.667 --> 00:36:38.353
maybe it's a parallel universe

00:36:40.543 --> 00:36:41.686
do you believe that

00:36:41.708 --> 00:36:42.789
somewhere out there

00:36:42.814 --> 00:36:45.099
there's a version of you that
never got sick?

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.376
and then he went to school
like a normal kid

00:36:47.607 --> 00:36:48.607
he graduated

00:36:48.905 --> 00:36:50.404
and became a little adventure

00:36:55.888 --> 00:36:57.700
how do you know i like adventures?

00:36:58.625 --> 00:36:59.835
climbers' Manual?

00:36:59.970 --> 00:37:01.090
outdoor knots?

00:37:01.335 --> 00:37:03.232
don't you have those on your table?

00:37:03.962 --> 00:37:05.722
i can't go out anyway

00:37:06.397 --> 00:37:07.761
I just read it for fun

00:37:08.690 --> 00:37:10.490
after I got sick, I figured

00:37:11.904 --> 00:37:13.412
now that I'm dying

00:37:14.569 --> 00:37:16.751
I might as well experience
something different

00:37:16.932 --> 00:37:18.612
please, you're not dying

00:37:18.625 --> 00:37:20.558
you're such a negative person

00:37:22.155 --> 00:37:23.435
always have been

00:37:23.588 --> 00:37:25.614
i never study hard

00:37:25.767 --> 00:37:27.313
or do the chores

00:37:28.208 --> 00:37:29.942
I even get tired of eating

00:37:30.819 --> 00:37:33.019
I'm always sleepy while I'm awake

00:37:34.704 --> 00:37:36.554
and I never got one of those
little red flower

00:37:36.579 --> 00:37:39.118
in the kindergarten
later in school

00:37:39.221 --> 00:37:41.028
I never won any thing, either

00:37:43.688 --> 00:37:46.742
what kind of pathetic kid
never even won a little red flower?

00:37:56.488 --> 00:37:58.221
I don't think that matters

00:38:15.406 --> 00:38:16.422
hey

00:38:17.750 --> 00:38:19.097
next time it's my treat

00:38:23.341 --> 00:38:26.047
keep going and turn right

00:38:31.266 --> 00:38:33.616
don't worry
I'll text you when I get home

00:38:46.190 --> 00:38:47.196
he's here

00:38:47.221 --> 00:38:48.221
scram

00:39:02.375 --> 00:39:03.575
are you hungry?

00:39:04.299 --> 00:39:05.613
can I get you anything to eat?

00:39:08.053 --> 00:39:09.053
I'm good

00:39:13.167 --> 00:39:14.900
our son

00:39:22.993 --> 00:39:24.445
I have a meeting in the morning

00:39:24.470 --> 00:39:25.470
we should rest now

00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:26.620
right

00:39:28.421 --> 00:39:29.919
we should rest now

00:40:10.301 --> 00:40:12.045
did you read that article I sent you?

00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:14.541
now there's a new top 10
ranking of anti cancer vegetable

00:40:22.132 --> 00:40:25.017
I didn't know the vegetables
are so competitive

00:40:25.318 --> 00:40:26.518
shut your mouth

00:40:26.605 --> 00:40:28.343
go print it out and put it on the fridge

00:40:29.510 --> 00:40:30.725
so I can cook, accordingly

00:40:34.605 --> 00:40:35.962
Ma Xiaoyuan: free this
afternoon?

00:40:35.987 --> 00:40:37.351
there's something
I'd like to meet

00:40:37.557 --> 00:40:38.851
I'm going out

00:40:58.944 --> 00:41:00.304
want another bet?

00:41:00.459 --> 00:41:01.459
fifty kuai

00:41:02.083 --> 00:41:04.285
I bet he's going out
with that girl again tomorrow

00:41:06.227 --> 00:41:07.227
I'll take it

00:41:09.167 --> 00:41:10.167
come here

00:41:10.545 --> 00:41:12.225
weibo ID: go_f_urself

00:41:12.496 --> 00:41:13.782
I'm Ma Xiaoyuan

00:41:14.156 --> 00:41:15.981
this is Wei Yihang, the boy
I told you about

00:41:16.037 --> 00:41:17.037
hi

00:41:17.529 --> 00:41:18.560
I'm Wu Xiaoliang

00:41:18.583 --> 00:41:20.830
also know as Adventurer_Wu on weibo

00:41:20.923 --> 00:41:21.947
he's famous

00:41:22.032 --> 00:41:23.572
got hundreds of thousands of followers

00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:24.610
I know

00:41:24.635 --> 00:41:25.835
i saw his vlogs

00:41:26.458 --> 00:41:28.211
this one is so persistent

00:41:28.377 --> 00:41:30.406
she sent me dozens of messages

00:41:31.538 --> 00:41:33.251
I learned a bit about your situation

00:41:33.656 --> 00:41:35.164
so, you love outdoor sports

00:41:35.227 --> 00:41:36.267
for how long?

00:41:37.167 --> 00:41:38.541
I wouldn't say love

00:41:38.589 --> 00:41:40.564
just like checking them out
every once in while

00:41:41.334 --> 00:41:42.525
where have you been?

00:41:44.208 --> 00:41:45.955
I've been to nowhere

00:41:46.630 --> 00:41:47.785
I'm sick

00:41:47.921 --> 00:41:48.921
can't travel

00:41:49.063 --> 00:41:50.761
xiao Wu has been to everywhere

00:41:50.864 --> 00:41:53.436
he crossed the no man zone of
lake Baikal alone

00:41:53.777 --> 00:41:55.876
he claimed Mount Everest
without supplemental oxygen

00:41:55.901 --> 00:41:57.923
- also
- yeah,people on the internet made those up

00:41:58.833 --> 00:42:01.357
but I have been to some pretty cool places

00:42:01.667 --> 00:42:02.999
what would you like to know

00:42:03.063 --> 00:42:04.341
or find interesting?

00:42:04.428 --> 00:42:05.611
just ask

00:42:07.079 --> 00:42:08.723
I would love to share with you

00:42:12.917 --> 00:42:14.597
he may be a little shy

00:42:17.057 --> 00:42:18.057
I'm not

00:42:18.871 --> 00:42:19.932
he just needs some time

00:42:22.587 --> 00:42:24.496
you should like you know me so well

00:42:25.028 --> 00:42:26.562
we've only met a few days ago

00:42:29.287 --> 00:42:31.269
I actually know people like you

00:42:32.174 --> 00:42:33.714
always longing to see the world

00:42:33.739 --> 00:42:35.419
but can't go anywhere

00:42:35.706 --> 00:42:37.079
if i were you

00:42:37.720 --> 00:42:39.672
i don't think I can survive a day

00:42:40.997 --> 00:42:42.410
come on, I'll friend you on WeChat

00:42:42.435 --> 00:42:43.435
sure

00:42:44.958 --> 00:42:46.235
show me your QR code

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:48.425
do you work out every day?

00:42:48.936 --> 00:42:50.456
cardio and strength

00:42:50.568 --> 00:42:51.989
just trying to say in good shape

00:42:53.322 --> 00:42:54.322
ah

00:42:55.417 --> 00:42:57.097
can I have a go at that?

00:42:57.649 --> 00:42:59.513
be my guest
I'll take some weight off for you

00:42:59.657 --> 00:43:01.029
no need, keep it

00:43:01.283 --> 00:43:02.371
what are you doing?

00:43:02.856 --> 00:43:04.079
what do you mean?

00:43:13.812 --> 00:43:14.939
maybe I should take some of

00:43:15.035 --> 00:43:16.035
stop

00:43:17.019 --> 00:43:18.019
it's okay

00:43:29.516 --> 00:43:30.682
what are you trying to prove?

00:43:30.690 --> 00:43:32.507
i could ask you the same thing

00:43:32.803 --> 00:43:34.690
you keep hooking me up
with all these strangers

00:43:34.715 --> 00:43:36.106
do you enjoy that?

00:43:36.407 --> 00:43:37.414
you're too negative

00:43:37.439 --> 00:43:38.885
i just want you to be happy

00:43:39.417 --> 00:43:40.417
really?

00:43:41.307 --> 00:43:43.299
are you sure you're not doing
this for yourself?

00:43:43.887 --> 00:43:45.950
xiao Wu has been to so many places

00:43:46.093 --> 00:43:47.989
climbed the Everest without
supplemental oxygen

00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.001
your smile was so big

00:43:49.026 --> 00:43:50.371
i could literally see that hole
behind your teeth

00:43:50.396 --> 00:43:51.770
Wei Yihang
do you know how many...

00:43:51.795 --> 00:43:53.604
message I sent him in the
middle of the night

00:43:53.629 --> 00:43:54.986
to get him to meet you in person?

00:43:55.072 --> 00:43:56.619
if only I knew how ungrateful you'd be

00:43:57.264 --> 00:43:58.264
right

00:43:58.289 --> 00:43:59.490
thanks for reminding me

00:44:00.493 --> 00:44:03.324
do you like hitting on
guys via instant messaging?

00:44:08.542 --> 00:44:09.561
i see

00:44:11.325 --> 00:44:12.664
what was that supposed to mean?

00:44:12.917 --> 00:44:14.019
what do you see?

00:44:15.704 --> 00:44:16.704
i just do

00:44:18.204 --> 00:44:19.463
finish that sentence

00:44:19.545 --> 00:44:20.733
don't keep me hanging

00:44:23.564 --> 00:44:24.684
you're jealous

00:44:30.147 --> 00:44:31.962
is that so obvious?

00:45:19.659 --> 00:45:21.325
still nothing at this hour?

00:45:22.167 --> 00:45:23.825
it's not gonna happen today

00:45:38.194 --> 00:45:39.995
I'm going out
don't wait up

00:45:50.569 --> 00:45:52.482
what scheme are you cooking up this time?

00:45:52.584 --> 00:45:53.783
I was thinking

00:45:53.823 --> 00:45:55.757
maybe we can't leave the city

00:45:55.986 --> 00:45:57.983
but we can still experience
something different

00:45:59.034 --> 00:46:00.947
this is from an online travel blog

00:46:01.027 --> 00:46:02.391
we can follow their exact route

00:46:02.431 --> 00:46:03.526
well, not exactly

00:46:04.057 --> 00:46:05.155
first stop today

00:46:05.275 --> 00:46:06.967
the Gansbaai Beach in South Africa

00:46:11.832 --> 00:46:12.832
dude

00:46:13.201 --> 00:46:14.321
this is stupid

00:46:14.719 --> 00:46:16.399
stupid is for grownup

00:46:17.197 --> 00:46:18.948
we kid only care for fun

00:46:23.401 --> 00:46:24.720
quit pitying yourself

00:46:24.751 --> 00:46:26.031
and try to fell it

00:46:26.309 --> 00:46:27.383
at night, Gansbaai

00:46:27.501 --> 00:46:29.748
looks no different than
other beautiful beaches

00:46:30.169 --> 00:46:32.169
Gentle breeze mixed with
salty scent of the ocean

00:46:32.431 --> 00:46:34.184
seagulls soaring in circles up above

00:46:34.359 --> 00:46:35.859
waves crashing against the reef

00:46:36.106 --> 00:46:38.734
bits of water hitting you in the face

00:46:38.805 --> 00:46:40.788
while immersed in this gorgeous scenery

00:46:40.874 --> 00:46:41.874
please don't forget

00:46:41.899 --> 00:46:44.252
you're now sharing this beach
with the great white sharks

00:46:51.012 --> 00:46:52.551
this time it's the North Pole

00:46:52.932 --> 00:46:53.932
nope

00:46:54.186 --> 00:46:55.424
it's the Antarctica

00:46:56.926 --> 00:46:57.927
what's the difference

00:46:57.952 --> 00:46:58.952
really

00:46:59.562 --> 00:47:00.562
behold

00:47:05.031 --> 00:47:06.951
you're floating in
the belly button of the earth

00:47:06.976 --> 00:47:07.976
the Dead Sea

00:47:08.001 --> 00:47:09.150
the familiar scene of sunset

00:47:09.175 --> 00:47:11.018
now seems to have an exotic vibe

00:47:11.066 --> 00:47:12.393
within its fading light

00:47:12.418 --> 00:47:13.838
your weary soul shall find comfort

00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:16.060
hurry up

00:47:16.262 --> 00:47:18.343
inside a karst cave underneath
the Himalayas

00:47:19.250 --> 00:47:21.222
on a stalactites formed
tens of millennium ago

00:47:21.560 --> 00:47:23.396
the crispy sounds of dripping water

00:47:33.810 --> 00:47:35.410
it never snows there

00:47:36.542 --> 00:47:37.902
nor is there wind

00:47:38.350 --> 00:47:40.377
the place has stayed
the same for eons of time

00:47:43.651 --> 00:47:45.928
strolling on a footpath in
the Grand Canyon of Colorado

00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:48.071
the Canyon Effect would make you feel like

00:47:48.096 --> 00:47:50.706
a kid that can take off at any moment

00:47:51.335 --> 00:47:53.589
now, if you scream into the wind

00:47:53.686 --> 00:47:56.467
it was send your voice
all the way to outer space

00:48:11.042 --> 00:48:13.005
those who have never come
to the Sahara Desert

00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:15.579
may not understand how sweet water can be

00:48:18.144 --> 00:48:19.708
don't you think sand here in the Sahara

00:48:19.733 --> 00:48:20.970
smell like sewage water?

00:48:21.581 --> 00:48:22.835
what's your problem, man?

00:48:23.152 --> 00:48:24.155
yeah?
and I guess...

00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:26.552
the wind in the canyon smells
like Yu Shiang Shredded Pork

00:48:28.047 --> 00:48:29.222
if we are doing this then

00:48:29.881 --> 00:48:31.073
the glacier cave last time

00:48:31.098 --> 00:48:32.105
smelled like urine

00:48:32.130 --> 00:48:33.138
didn't you smell it?

00:48:33.163 --> 00:48:34.163
that's enough

00:48:34.237 --> 00:48:35.277
your turn to narrate

00:48:38.420 --> 00:48:39.525
what am I supposed to say?

00:48:39.581 --> 00:48:42.126
the carbon dioxide and particles

00:48:42.207 --> 00:48:44.011
in the Martian atmosphere absorb red light

00:48:44.667 --> 00:48:47.995
that's why when seen from
Mars the sun isn't red...

00:48:48.393 --> 00:48:49.433
if we keep going like this

00:48:49.458 --> 00:48:50.989
we're about to leave the solar system

00:48:51.593 --> 00:48:52.950
...but blue

00:48:58.495 --> 00:49:01.423
now we're at the highest
waterfall of the world

00:49:01.448 --> 00:49:03.364
is Salto Angel in Venezuela

00:49:03.442 --> 00:49:05.134
in the thundering noise, you fell secluded

00:49:05.159 --> 00:49:06.255
away from civilization

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:08.366
a rainbow occurs over the mist

00:49:08.478 --> 00:49:12.700
it's as if you were that old man from up

00:50:06.780 --> 00:50:08.976
do you ever wonder
what you'll look like old?

00:50:09.802 --> 00:50:10.802
no

00:50:11.016 --> 00:50:12.984
not sure if I'd live long enough
to grow old

00:50:14.208 --> 00:50:15.488
here we go again

00:50:21.635 --> 00:50:22.635
come on

00:50:23.889 --> 00:50:24.889
what?

00:50:24.914 --> 00:50:26.589
let me show you what being old is like

00:50:28.706 --> 00:50:29.706
hurry

00:51:00.542 --> 00:51:02.247
dancing in the crowd

00:51:02.684 --> 00:51:05.833
I feel the joy
of being normal for the first time

00:51:08.548 --> 00:51:10.182
growing old like everyone else

00:51:11.055 --> 00:51:13.347
no longer seems a distant dream

00:51:29.082 --> 00:51:30.650
you have to try some of this tofu jelly

00:51:31.174 --> 00:51:32.785
I've been coming here since I was little

00:52:07.442 --> 00:52:08.482
it's the lake

00:52:09.164 --> 00:52:10.918
the one you saw in in the future is this?

00:52:11.336 --> 00:52:12.588
do you know where this lake is?

00:52:12.613 --> 00:52:13.691
no idea

00:52:13.811 --> 00:52:15.771
had this made at the Xerox place

00:52:16.208 --> 00:52:17.328
can we keep it?

00:52:17.384 --> 00:52:18.678
I'll get you a new one

00:52:18.717 --> 00:52:20.027
no need

00:52:20.369 --> 00:52:22.186
I'm quitting when the lease expires anyway

00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.430
it'd be useless then

00:52:23.803 --> 00:52:24.803
how come you're quitting?

00:52:25.067 --> 00:52:26.275
I'm going back to my home town

00:52:26.402 --> 00:52:28.332
my kids have been at home
for a couple years now

00:52:28.357 --> 00:52:29.364
I need to look after them

00:52:32.428 --> 00:52:34.976
Wei Yihang

00:52:56.886 --> 00:52:58.370
the natural of this gray spot here

00:52:58.958 --> 00:53:00.638
is yet to be determined

00:53:00.910 --> 00:53:03.640
we'll wait till the results come back

00:53:04.157 --> 00:53:05.640
before drawing any conclusions

00:53:05.784 --> 00:53:07.140
I thought it was stabilized

00:53:07.188 --> 00:53:08.188
how on earth...

00:53:08.418 --> 00:53:09.880
when will the results come back??

00:53:09.935 --> 00:53:12.285
reoccurrence is an inevitable phase

00:53:12.619 --> 00:53:14.219
in cancer treatment

00:53:15.524 --> 00:53:16.753
but you mustn't worry too much

00:53:16.833 --> 00:53:19.158
even if there's a problem, it won't be..

00:53:19.543 --> 00:53:20.543
mom

00:53:20.583 --> 00:53:21.924
can I have some money?

00:53:22.885 --> 00:53:23.885
how much?

00:53:25.321 --> 00:53:26.321
about ten grand

00:53:28.027 --> 00:53:29.463
what are you gonna use it for?

00:53:29.946 --> 00:53:30.955
what will you do?

00:53:32.918 --> 00:53:34.258
I want to go hiking

00:53:34.424 --> 00:53:35.614
and I need some gear for that

00:53:37.843 --> 00:53:39.870
going hiking in your current condition?

00:53:42.151 --> 00:53:43.162
it'll be suicide

00:53:43.187 --> 00:53:44.306
forget I said anything then

00:53:44.770 --> 00:53:46.264
I didn't say no, did I?

00:53:46.416 --> 00:53:47.421
what I meant was

00:53:47.446 --> 00:53:48.840
with you situation now
save it

00:53:49.052 --> 00:53:50.361
I don't want to hear it

00:54:06.679 --> 00:54:08.249
kind madam, please have mercy

00:54:09.447 --> 00:54:10.807
is your kid sick?

00:54:11.259 --> 00:54:12.740
is he sick?

00:54:18.188 --> 00:54:19.630
at least you're not sick or disabled

00:54:19.655 --> 00:54:22.126
why don't you get a real job so
you can support your child?

00:54:23.149 --> 00:54:24.206
can't you do that?

00:54:28.647 --> 00:54:29.936
what the hell is this?

00:54:46.134 --> 00:54:48.498
life always finds a way to me that

00:54:49.684 --> 00:54:51.364
besides pain and pity

00:54:51.932 --> 00:54:53.353
I deserve nothing

00:54:55.548 --> 00:54:57.135
that neither adventures nor hope

00:54:57.552 --> 00:54:59.072
are within my reach

00:55:04.933 --> 00:55:08.788
happy birthday to you

00:55:09.553 --> 00:55:13.188
happy birthday granny
wish you all the best

00:55:14.696 --> 00:55:16.430
look how sweet Chenchen is

00:55:17.568 --> 00:55:18.613
the big one is for Yihang

00:55:18.660 --> 00:55:19.672
it's enough for everyone

00:55:19.697 --> 00:55:20.809
he can help himself

00:55:21.140 --> 00:55:22.140
I'll cut it

00:55:22.190 --> 00:55:23.190
great

00:55:27.557 --> 00:55:28.853
I want to go pee pee

00:55:29.462 --> 00:55:31.089
- take him
- it's OK, Yihang

00:55:31.162 --> 00:55:32.365
take Chenchen to the bathroom

00:55:32.471 --> 00:55:33.471
hurry

00:55:34.724 --> 00:55:35.749
follow your cousin

00:55:37.078 --> 00:55:38.110
come on, let's eat

00:55:44.798 --> 00:55:45.798
brother

00:55:46.147 --> 00:55:47.599
you need to take care of yourself

00:55:49.530 --> 00:55:51.363
I'm fine
it's the same old thing

00:55:51.926 --> 00:55:53.762
maybe I'll ask Lao Huang
to arrange something

00:55:53.787 --> 00:55:54.827
a gastroscopy

00:55:56.010 --> 00:55:57.736
no need, it's only gastric ulcer

00:55:57.822 --> 00:55:58.862
I'm fine, mom

00:56:00.884 --> 00:56:01.889
sister in law

00:56:01.914 --> 00:56:03.194
when will the result come back?

00:56:03.433 --> 00:56:04.473
in a few days

00:56:05.549 --> 00:56:06.549
cousin

00:56:06.583 --> 00:56:07.583
son

00:56:07.925 --> 00:56:10.091
you just make sure
he gets all the treatments to needs

00:56:10.328 --> 00:56:11.625
if you need more money

00:56:11.652 --> 00:56:13.096
I can always sell my house

00:56:13.458 --> 00:56:14.688
and move a nursing home

00:56:15.174 --> 00:56:16.176
it'll be great

00:56:16.201 --> 00:56:17.644
I get to live with my girls

00:56:17.762 --> 00:56:18.769
from the old neighborhood

00:56:19.059 --> 00:56:20.634
what are you thinking about, mom?

00:56:21.196 --> 00:56:22.849
if someone had to sell a house it'd be us

00:56:22.874 --> 00:56:23.874
it's not your problem...

00:56:24.437 --> 00:56:25.442
your house

00:56:25.515 --> 00:56:27.277
you mean the one Yihang's grandpa left you?

00:56:27.820 --> 00:56:29.008
it's company property

00:56:29.312 --> 00:56:30.388
how are you gonna sell it?

00:56:31.208 --> 00:56:32.211
then I'll sell mine

00:56:32.555 --> 00:56:33.964
you can't go live in a nursing home

00:56:34.292 --> 00:56:35.589
if they still need more money...

00:56:35.644 --> 00:56:37.057
then sis
you should ship in too

00:56:37.772 --> 00:56:38.777
we're a family

00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:40.728
we'll makes sure the kid get treated

00:56:40.847 --> 00:56:42.024
even if it means we go broke

00:56:42.241 --> 00:56:43.241
that's right

00:56:43.266 --> 00:56:44.266
here

00:56:44.292 --> 00:56:45.292
brother

00:56:45.937 --> 00:56:47.351
brother

00:56:47.450 --> 00:56:48.455
what are you doing?

00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:49.480
he'll see

00:56:49.765 --> 00:56:51.034
it's OK

00:56:52.801 --> 00:56:53.801
brother

00:56:54.803 --> 00:56:56.483
no worries, we got you

00:56:57.640 --> 00:56:58.645
please don't do this

00:57:24.761 --> 00:57:25.769
Wei Yihang

00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:35.990
you're not answering your phone

00:57:36.258 --> 00:57:37.590
or replying to my WeChat messages

00:57:37.615 --> 00:57:39.182
I figured you must've been sick as hell

00:57:40.829 --> 00:57:41.829
I'm alright

00:57:42.172 --> 00:57:43.197
what's going on?

00:57:44.513 --> 00:57:45.529
nothing

00:57:46.032 --> 00:57:47.212
what's with the attitude?

00:57:47.582 --> 00:57:49.418
would it kill you to say more
than two words?

00:57:52.812 --> 00:57:54.572
thanks for coming

00:57:54.749 --> 00:57:56.093
so long

00:58:01.348 --> 00:58:02.348
I know

00:58:02.390 --> 00:58:04.073
waiting for the result can be excruciating

00:58:04.272 --> 00:58:05.506
you're under a lot of pressure

00:58:06.062 --> 00:58:08.102
you know what?
I'll introduce you to to my friend

00:58:08.195 --> 00:58:09.306
he's a therapist

00:58:09.399 --> 00:58:10.399
stop

00:58:12.625 --> 00:58:14.170
you're hooking me up with people again

00:58:15.326 --> 00:58:16.842
I'm a nutcase
I know that

00:58:18.018 --> 00:58:19.932
but your obsessive need to
control others' life

00:58:19.957 --> 00:58:21.193
is not exactly normal behavior

00:58:22.721 --> 00:58:23.724
maybe both of us

00:58:24.197 --> 00:58:25.877
need some kind of therapy

00:58:26.284 --> 00:58:27.570
we can catch up when we're cured

00:58:29.375 --> 00:58:31.055
who says I want catch up?

00:58:41.631 --> 00:58:43.400
I'll sing a song for Lingling

00:58:43.647 --> 00:58:45.327
hope she recovers soon

00:58:45.333 --> 00:58:46.333
great

00:58:48.930 --> 00:58:53.033
🎶farewell comrade

00:58:53.338 --> 00:58:56.906
as you embark on this journey

00:58:57.690 --> 00:59:01.634
not a word but tears falling down my face

00:59:02.071 --> 00:59:05.888
and the sound of camel bells byvmy ears 🎶

00:59:05.928 --> 00:59:07.021
what are you thinking?

00:59:10.839 --> 00:59:12.085
Ma Xiaoyuan isn't here?

00:59:12.728 --> 00:59:14.228
she hasn't been around much lately

00:59:15.726 --> 00:59:16.726
actually

00:59:17.899 --> 00:59:19.091
I've never had cancer

00:59:20.478 --> 00:59:21.702
it was my wife

00:59:23.258 --> 00:59:25.597
we can here seeking treatment

00:59:27.438 --> 00:59:29.905
and we opened this wig shop to get by

00:59:31.083 --> 00:59:32.763
my wife was an optimist

00:59:33.968 --> 00:59:35.648
and she had helped many

00:59:36.547 --> 00:59:38.126
that's how this group came to be

00:59:40.070 --> 00:59:41.658
then she passed

00:59:43.330 --> 00:59:44.850
and I took it over

00:59:46.212 --> 00:59:48.101
all these years dealing with

00:59:48.157 --> 00:59:50.529
people who were barely surviving

00:59:51.639 --> 00:59:53.202
had taught me one thing

00:59:54.313 --> 00:59:55.916
anyone with cancer or no cancer

00:59:56.829 --> 00:59:58.210
guts or no guts

01:00:00.810 --> 01:00:02.317
you have got to at least try

01:00:03.333 --> 01:00:05.685
this negative attitude just won't cut it

01:00:38.684 --> 01:00:42.692
sorry, the subscriber you've
dialed can not be contacted right now

01:01:58.188 --> 01:01:59.505
Ma Xiaoyuan

01:02:02.807 --> 01:02:04.382
Ma Xiaoyuan

01:02:07.057 --> 01:02:08.604
Ma Xiaoyuan

01:02:11.669 --> 01:02:13.247
Ma Xiao...

01:02:15.899 --> 01:02:17.671
what are you doing at this hour?

01:02:19.656 --> 01:02:20.985
have you been drinking?

01:02:21.679 --> 01:02:23.237
come on, don't stand in the rain

01:02:28.158 --> 01:02:29.268
you...

01:02:30.291 --> 01:02:31.954
why did you back me?

01:02:33.313 --> 01:02:35.927
I thought we agreed to see each other
only after we're both cured

01:02:35.952 --> 01:02:37.638
- and that's not gonna happen for me
- stop

01:02:38.423 --> 01:02:39.494
not another word

01:02:39.519 --> 01:02:41.840
best let me speak first
before the alcohol wears off

01:02:43.299 --> 01:02:44.299
Ma Xiaoyuan

01:02:45.706 --> 01:02:46.837
you know...

01:02:47.353 --> 01:02:49.257
I always keep to the
side of the road as I walk

01:02:50.032 --> 01:02:51.435
and sit the back end

01:02:51.460 --> 01:02:53.563
every time I take a bus

01:02:56.255 --> 01:02:59.181
and i always choose the
corner table in a restaurant

01:02:59.926 --> 01:03:02.659
because I hate making contact with people

01:03:03.319 --> 01:03:05.412
I'm afraid of being noticed

01:03:07.033 --> 01:03:08.372
you wanna know why?

01:03:09.047 --> 01:03:10.047
because...

01:03:11.339 --> 01:03:15.879
I'm afraid that I'd die right after

01:03:16.941 --> 01:03:18.861
I open myself up to someone

01:03:24.208 --> 01:03:26.148
I fear letting her go

01:03:26.218 --> 01:03:27.974
and vice versa

01:03:29.353 --> 01:03:31.436
then you showed up

01:03:32.448 --> 01:03:33.864
and my so called principles

01:03:33.889 --> 01:03:36.280
like all my pain in the
ass negative energies

01:03:36.358 --> 01:03:37.458
just got blown away

01:03:40.057 --> 01:03:41.788
now, every morning I open my eyes

01:03:41.813 --> 01:03:44.343
your face is the first image
that pops into my head

01:03:45.355 --> 01:03:46.396
Every night

01:03:46.456 --> 01:03:47.460
lying on my bed

01:03:47.485 --> 01:03:50.516
I can't help but listening to
all your voice message again

01:03:50.645 --> 01:03:51.999
before falling asleep

01:03:52.832 --> 01:03:55.486
I amplified every selfie
you posted on WeChat

01:03:55.556 --> 01:03:57.262
till each pixel is visible

01:03:57.302 --> 01:03:58.656
and printed in my mind

01:04:00.432 --> 01:04:01.689
it's like

01:04:01.803 --> 01:04:04.077
reciting a paragraph from textbook

01:04:04.150 --> 01:04:06.071
I memorize everything
you ever said to me so well

01:04:06.096 --> 01:04:07.740
That I know them backwards

01:04:10.132 --> 01:04:11.466
till one day

01:04:12.825 --> 01:04:14.325
I suddenly realized that

01:04:15.465 --> 01:04:18.475
I've forgotten something really important

01:04:18.554 --> 01:04:20.954
but I couldn't remember what it was

01:04:22.798 --> 01:04:24.281
and then that day

01:04:25.875 --> 01:04:27.207
when I fainted

01:04:28.706 --> 01:04:30.228
I remembered it

01:04:34.500 --> 01:04:37.867
that I am a cancer patient

01:04:41.427 --> 01:04:42.427
me

01:04:42.835 --> 01:04:45.067
a cancer patient

01:04:46.583 --> 01:04:48.742
I'm constantly reminded that

01:04:50.873 --> 01:04:54.010
I may die anytime

01:04:54.070 --> 01:04:56.670
so, what right do I have to play normal

01:05:01.887 --> 01:05:03.632
God hates me so much that

01:05:03.682 --> 01:05:05.671
every time I start to feel something nice

01:05:05.696 --> 01:05:08.374
my life immediately gets
switched to head mode

01:05:08.464 --> 01:05:10.319
whom do you reckon God likes then?

01:05:20.524 --> 01:05:21.947
see that old lady ever there?

01:05:22.652 --> 01:05:25.434
she used to love bragging to everyone
about how her grandson grew fast

01:05:25.633 --> 01:05:27.651
and just when he's old
enough to go to kindergarten

01:05:27.761 --> 01:05:29.441
the boy was kidnapped

01:05:30.816 --> 01:05:32.755
for three years she never
stopped looking for him

01:05:32.810 --> 01:05:34.993
she taught herself to use
the internet and make videos

01:05:35.018 --> 01:05:37.143
every time it rains she
waits by the side of the road

01:05:37.168 --> 01:05:39.449
so she can replace the missing
person posters on the poles

01:05:39.474 --> 01:05:40.506
with new ones

01:05:43.798 --> 01:05:44.799
and that's Xiao Zhang

01:05:45.206 --> 01:05:46.843
he's just three years older than you

01:05:47.319 --> 01:05:49.452
and he delivers food to
half the people on the street

01:05:49.809 --> 01:05:50.999
he was born deaf and mute

01:05:51.049 --> 01:05:52.671
so he can only
communicate with customers

01:05:52.696 --> 01:05:54.562
using a voice message
someone recommend for him

01:05:54.729 --> 01:05:56.659
still, he gets bad reviews all the time

01:05:56.937 --> 01:05:58.346
and has been assaulted by drunkards

01:05:59.308 --> 01:06:01.094
you think God likes them?

01:06:01.709 --> 01:06:03.586
yet they never gave up

01:06:03.656 --> 01:06:04.727
and you?

01:06:04.806 --> 01:06:06.274
you keep saying

01:06:07.822 --> 01:06:09.216
how fate doesn't treat you fairly

01:06:09.241 --> 01:06:10.962
and how it's hard for others to let you go?

01:06:11.309 --> 01:06:12.884
who the heck do you think you are?

01:06:18.133 --> 01:06:20.511
I've been taking handfuls of
meds every day since I was five

01:06:21.553 --> 01:06:22.922
and i already knew back then

01:06:23.548 --> 01:06:24.571
that even being alive

01:06:24.699 --> 01:06:26.366
wasn't something you can take for granted

01:06:26.943 --> 01:06:28.951
you think that cynical
attitude of yours is badass?

01:06:29.329 --> 01:06:30.333
let me tell you

01:06:30.491 --> 01:06:32.188
you're not a badass
you're a coward

01:06:32.213 --> 01:06:34.224
-Ma Xiaoyuan
-what, you're gonna disprove me again?

01:06:34.249 --> 01:06:35.374
I like you

01:06:39.422 --> 01:06:40.486
I mean...

01:06:42.213 --> 01:06:44.415
what I'm trying to say is...
I've learned how to do this

01:06:46.463 --> 01:06:47.463
this

01:06:48.199 --> 01:06:49.239
and this, too

01:07:52.692 --> 01:07:53.793
you're Xiaoyuan's father

01:07:54.090 --> 01:07:55.800
and you're Yihang's mom?
you must be Mr. Ma

01:07:55.825 --> 01:07:57.684
we're so sorry for everything
that's okay

01:07:57.950 --> 01:07:58.950
here's the thing

01:07:59.528 --> 01:08:02.099
so, I broke my arm, and when
I got back from the hospital

01:08:02.189 --> 01:08:04.153
I saw from distance
in the pouring rain that

01:08:04.193 --> 01:08:05.227
there were two people

01:08:05.577 --> 01:08:06.577
hugging each other

01:08:06.953 --> 01:08:08.131
I took a good look

01:08:08.917 --> 01:08:10.599
and they turned out to be our kids

01:08:11.155 --> 01:08:13.064
it's not that oppose to
young love or anything

01:08:13.262 --> 01:08:15.705
it's just, why couldn't they talk inside?

01:08:16.053 --> 01:08:17.414
they both had their heads cut once

01:08:17.708 --> 01:08:18.959
it's so easy to catch cold

01:08:18.984 --> 01:08:20.596
getting soaked like that
was it worth it?

01:08:21.150 --> 01:08:22.150
what are you looking at?

01:08:22.579 --> 01:08:24.956
no more complaining about
headache during rainy days are we?

01:08:26.520 --> 01:08:27.858
I heard you drank alcohol?

01:08:27.963 --> 01:08:29.882
could you at least give
us a heads up next time?

01:08:29.922 --> 01:08:31.648
next time? there's not gonna be a next time

01:08:31.673 --> 01:08:34.398
of course there won't be a next time
you should know better than that

01:08:34.423 --> 01:08:35.995
sorry for the trouble
we do apologize

01:08:36.065 --> 01:08:37.065
well then...

01:08:37.097 --> 01:08:38.121
here, you smoke?

01:08:42.067 --> 01:08:43.079
you two, stay here

01:08:43.104 --> 01:08:44.971
and think about what you did

01:08:46.290 --> 01:08:47.290
man

01:08:47.315 --> 01:08:49.190
this is a huge garage you got here

01:08:49.289 --> 01:08:51.179
it's not that huge
this is all we got

01:08:51.301 --> 01:08:52.305
we fix cars here

01:08:52.330 --> 01:08:53.552
and she sleeps up there

01:08:54.307 --> 01:08:55.953
I'll deal with you when we get home

01:08:55.978 --> 01:08:58.672
why don't I give you
guys a tour in the office?

01:08:59.039 --> 01:09:00.589
such a huge place

01:09:27.934 --> 01:09:28.974
what is this?

01:09:29.194 --> 01:09:30.196
a little red flower

01:09:31.912 --> 01:09:33.827
for taking the initiative
for the first time

01:10:08.295 --> 01:10:09.295
hey

01:10:09.542 --> 01:10:10.980
I think I know where the lake is

01:10:11.313 --> 01:10:13.503
I'm telling you, I'm totally a genius

01:10:13.885 --> 01:10:15.333
so I asked the guy at the restaurant

01:10:15.358 --> 01:10:16.634
where he had the menus printed

01:10:17.015 --> 01:10:18.452
then, at the Xerox place

01:10:18.477 --> 01:10:20.290
I found the original picture
of that backdrop

01:10:20.438 --> 01:10:22.656
and it has a digital watermark
left by the photographer

01:10:22.776 --> 01:10:25.085
then you found his Weibo account

01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:26.451
and sent him messages

01:10:26.689 --> 01:10:27.689
exactly

01:10:27.944 --> 01:10:28.944
the lake

01:10:28.969 --> 01:10:30.009
is in Qinghai

01:10:30.412 --> 01:10:31.436
did you IM him too?

01:10:33.427 --> 01:10:35.897
I used an image recognition app, duh?

01:10:36.104 --> 01:10:37.625
how come you aren't more excited than?

01:10:37.843 --> 01:10:38.848
don't you wanna go?

01:10:39.181 --> 01:10:40.301
of course I do

01:10:40.750 --> 01:10:42.419
but what if my mom won't give me money?

01:10:43.269 --> 01:10:45.063
we should get the money on our own

01:10:45.317 --> 01:10:46.888
better earring some than begging for it

01:10:50.053 --> 01:10:53.259
100 percent handmade
novelty watch for children

01:10:53.569 --> 01:10:54.929
buy now price, 80

01:10:59.458 --> 01:11:01.110
there's no way this thing's worth 80

01:11:01.682 --> 01:11:03.185
i wove this myself, hello?

01:11:08.692 --> 01:11:10.614
in that case, my dad's sculpture

01:11:10.717 --> 01:11:12.994
the ugly ass postmodernism rooster

01:11:13.081 --> 01:11:14.518
will be worth no less than

01:11:14.678 --> 01:11:15.718
three hundred

01:11:22.652 --> 01:11:23.652
this?

01:11:24.099 --> 01:11:25.099
350 at least

01:11:28.042 --> 01:11:29.322
you're so greedy

01:11:29.684 --> 01:11:31.168
I'm not forcing anyone to buy, am I?

01:11:31.193 --> 01:11:32.739
just waiting for them to take the bait

01:11:47.298 --> 01:11:48.505
what day is today?

01:11:48.981 --> 01:11:50.529
Sunday, what?

01:11:53.458 --> 01:11:54.458
nothing

01:12:10.897 --> 01:12:12.269
you mom's asleep?
she is

01:12:16.682 --> 01:12:17.682
dad

01:12:17.958 --> 01:12:18.958
what?

01:12:21.436 --> 01:12:23.228
I thought you didn't have to work today

01:12:25.942 --> 01:12:28.142
there was a meeting type of thing

01:12:28.623 --> 01:12:29.623
a wrap up

01:12:30.764 --> 01:12:32.510
that lasted for the entire afternoon

01:12:35.328 --> 01:12:37.008
not even a dinner break

01:12:37.598 --> 01:12:38.599
I'm starving

01:12:39.901 --> 01:12:40.908
it so happens that

01:12:41.131 --> 01:12:42.599
i just made some noodles

01:12:42.805 --> 01:12:44.361
with two eggs

01:12:45.202 --> 01:12:46.356
it's okay, you can have that

01:12:46.484 --> 01:12:47.842
I'll make one myself later

01:12:48.144 --> 01:12:49.294
I don't fell like eating

01:12:49.549 --> 01:12:51.240
lost my appetite soon as i cooked it

01:12:51.605 --> 01:12:52.613
it's all yours

01:12:53.550 --> 01:12:54.835
I'll go get you some pickles

01:12:56.561 --> 01:12:57.561
ok, then

01:12:58.583 --> 01:12:59.639
if you wanna eat later

01:12:59.663 --> 01:13:00.664
I'll cook for you

01:13:00.688 --> 01:13:01.688
give me that

01:13:22.675 --> 01:13:23.920
let me put this on you

01:13:23.945 --> 01:13:25.333
nice and tight

01:13:26.027 --> 01:13:27.891
- it's so pretty now
- isn't that pretty?

01:13:27.960 --> 01:13:28.960
wait, here's

01:13:29.036 --> 01:13:30.117
an extra strand of hair

01:13:30.189 --> 01:13:31.595
let me just cut it real quick

01:13:31.667 --> 01:13:32.667
almost done

01:13:34.558 --> 01:13:35.558
all right

01:13:36.916 --> 01:13:37.964
does it took good or what?

01:13:37.989 --> 01:13:38.989
does it took good

01:13:39.684 --> 01:13:40.772
it certainly does

01:13:40.797 --> 01:13:41.797
Gorgeous
come on

01:13:43.393 --> 01:13:44.938
thank you, uncle

01:13:45.026 --> 01:13:46.034
you're welcome

01:13:46.201 --> 01:13:47.201
thanks man

01:13:47.938 --> 01:13:49.986
let's go

01:13:51.955 --> 01:13:53.004
what are you doing here?

01:13:53.712 --> 01:13:54.759
for a recheck?

01:13:55.173 --> 01:13:56.360
no
just passing through

01:13:56.795 --> 01:13:58.455
by the way, I want to ask you something

01:13:59.225 --> 01:14:00.225
is that so?

01:14:00.590 --> 01:14:01.590
what is it?

01:14:02.199 --> 01:14:03.684
that thing you posted on WeChat

01:14:03.733 --> 01:14:05.875
the medicine trial volunteer program
how do I sign up?

01:14:07.423 --> 01:14:08.423
actually

01:14:08.566 --> 01:14:10.406
it was posted by a friend who is a
pharmaceutical sales representative

01:14:10.457 --> 01:14:11.659
i just forwarded it as a favor

01:14:11.684 --> 01:14:12.757
why are you interested?

01:14:13.194 --> 01:14:14.892
I'm just asking for a friend

01:14:15.559 --> 01:14:16.559
a friend

01:14:17.083 --> 01:14:18.528
actually
i wouldn't call him a friend

01:14:18.568 --> 01:14:20.172
just some dude i met in this online game

01:14:20.753 --> 01:14:21.926
will the volunteers get paid?

01:14:22.196 --> 01:14:23.307
sure, every time

01:14:23.338 --> 01:14:24.966
however
there's screening process

01:14:25.046 --> 01:14:27.616
i think the trial is for some
kind of psychoactive drug

01:14:29.934 --> 01:14:31.410
my guy is a perfect candidate then

01:14:31.624 --> 01:14:33.799
I've always suspected there's
something wrong with him

01:14:33.824 --> 01:14:35.386
he never takes the buffs while jungling

01:14:35.411 --> 01:14:36.920
all he does is running around ganking

01:14:36.945 --> 01:14:38.510
that's why he's so useless in late game

01:14:38.535 --> 01:14:40.540
i didn't understand a word you said
you know what?

01:14:40.565 --> 01:14:41.882
I'll get a business card for you

01:14:46.891 --> 01:14:49.051
no, they're testing side effects
of psychoactive drugs

01:14:49.076 --> 01:14:51.179
- no looking for actual mental patients
- i know

01:14:52.905 --> 01:14:53.944
how about

01:14:53.969 --> 01:14:56.423
i take a picture and send it to him
then he can go ask himself

01:14:56.448 --> 01:14:57.448
sure

01:14:57.519 --> 01:14:58.519
thanks

01:15:12.434 --> 01:15:14.086
Goji berry and broccoli

01:15:14.547 --> 01:15:15.876
can be a hot couple

01:15:19.543 --> 01:15:21.712
do you have something you wanna tell us?

01:15:31.305 --> 01:15:32.608
i was going to

01:15:33.386 --> 01:15:35.135
but maybe i should wait till later

01:15:37.707 --> 01:15:38.707
i eh

01:15:39.263 --> 01:15:40.637
found the lake

01:15:40.678 --> 01:15:41.838
i saw during my surgery

01:15:43.061 --> 01:15:44.943
and I going there with Ma Xiaoyuan

01:15:46.583 --> 01:15:47.810
how are you gonna afford that?

01:15:48.319 --> 01:15:49.760
i sold some of my

01:15:49.785 --> 01:15:51.277
limited edition toys on a website

01:15:51.690 --> 01:15:53.499
Ma Xiaoyuan managed to get some money, too

01:15:54.634 --> 01:15:55.699
it should be enough

01:16:04.069 --> 01:16:05.093
that's bullshit

01:16:13.290 --> 01:16:15.132
who gave you the right to go
through my stuff?

01:16:15.561 --> 01:16:16.801
if i hadn't found this

01:16:16.833 --> 01:16:19.287
you'd have turned yourself into a lunatic

01:16:21.436 --> 01:16:22.761
wu Xiaomei told you, didn't he?

01:16:25.095 --> 01:16:26.095
good

01:16:27.763 --> 01:16:28.763
just perfect

01:16:39.196 --> 01:16:40.846
you don't have to stare at me like that

01:16:41.551 --> 01:16:42.831
I'm an adult now

01:16:43.553 --> 01:16:44.912
I can responsible for my behavior

01:16:45.682 --> 01:16:46.874
I know what I'm doing

01:16:53.192 --> 01:16:54.552
if you need money

01:16:55.050 --> 01:16:56.416
you could've just asked

01:16:56.694 --> 01:16:58.829
you can't abuse yourself like that

01:17:00.692 --> 01:17:02.882
I've been a burden to you long enough

01:17:04.177 --> 01:17:05.692
this time I just want to do something

01:17:05.717 --> 01:17:06.993
for myself in my way

01:17:07.065 --> 01:17:08.065
can't i?

01:17:08.178 --> 01:17:09.178
what way?

01:17:09.646 --> 01:17:10.646
Wei Yihang

01:17:11.251 --> 01:17:12.253
let me tell you something

01:17:12.278 --> 01:17:14.540
your body doesn't just belong to you

01:17:14.699 --> 01:17:16.683
it belongs to us, too

01:17:18.190 --> 01:17:19.436
dad, take a look around

01:17:22.016 --> 01:17:23.190
ever since i got sick

01:17:23.215 --> 01:17:25.304
have we even bought one new thing?

01:17:32.049 --> 01:17:33.992
the table can barely stand

01:17:35.049 --> 01:17:36.334
and your phone

01:17:37.429 --> 01:17:39.374
the cracks on the screen are beyond fixing

01:17:40.177 --> 01:17:41.224
when you both get off work

01:17:41.249 --> 01:17:43.382
one goes pinching leaves off
vegetables in the market

01:17:43.407 --> 01:17:45.241
and the other works as a Uber
driver secretly

01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:47.783
this family hasn't always been this way

01:17:48.673 --> 01:17:50.254
and I don't want to see you like this

01:17:51.024 --> 01:17:52.176
no need to worry about us

01:17:52.550 --> 01:17:54.690
- we are happy with the way things are
- well, I'm not

01:17:57.599 --> 01:17:59.607
I don't want you to lose sleep
over stomach ache

01:17:59.632 --> 01:18:01.053
and still wouldn't do a gastroscopy

01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:03.524
and mom, she goes on and on with people

01:18:03.564 --> 01:18:04.962
so she can save a few more nickels

01:18:05.923 --> 01:18:07.990
and there's grandma, at her age

01:18:08.298 --> 01:18:09.305
she has to sell her house

01:18:09.330 --> 01:18:11.155
so I'd have treatment for
God knows how long?

01:18:13.052 --> 01:18:15.005
the things you did to save me

01:18:15.030 --> 01:18:16.865
only make me feel like a burden

01:18:16.897 --> 01:18:18.627
and I'm not grateful at all

01:18:19.757 --> 01:18:21.235
I would kill myself

01:18:21.275 --> 01:18:22.721
if I don't get out of this life soon

01:19:16.763 --> 01:19:19.025
now that you've let it of your system

01:19:19.827 --> 01:19:20.851
its time to go home

01:19:22.311 --> 01:19:23.991
I'll crash here tonight

01:19:24.675 --> 01:19:26.611
then you'd better go
downstairs and tell you dad

01:19:26.817 --> 01:19:27.817
no way

01:19:28.413 --> 01:19:29.539
then you can't stay

01:19:29.928 --> 01:19:30.928
move

01:19:33.307 --> 01:19:34.307
get up

01:19:37.807 --> 01:19:39.555
you think i wanna stay here with you?

01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:41.541
if you didn't tell them

01:19:41.565 --> 01:19:42.861
none of this would have happened

01:19:43.139 --> 01:19:44.775
and you don't get why i told them?

01:19:46.712 --> 01:19:48.549
have you ever thought of me
as a real friend?

01:19:49.167 --> 01:19:50.450
we're not even friends

01:19:50.475 --> 01:19:51.648
what are you blaming me for?

01:19:52.057 --> 01:19:53.057
ha?

01:19:53.083 --> 01:19:54.083
sure

01:19:54.426 --> 01:19:55.912
we're not even friends

01:19:57.542 --> 01:19:59.674
but it never stops you from
interfering with my life

01:19:59.936 --> 01:20:01.753
only because I'm friends with your parents

01:20:03.571 --> 01:20:05.491
you think I go to your house for you?

01:20:06.037 --> 01:20:07.491
I feel sorry for them

01:20:08.428 --> 01:20:10.562
long before you joined the group

01:20:11.024 --> 01:20:12.704
they've come many times

01:20:13.561 --> 01:20:15.378
they were afraid people might
treat you badly

01:20:15.768 --> 01:20:17.331
so they went around talking to everyone

01:20:17.356 --> 01:20:18.839
telling them what a great kid you are

01:20:18.942 --> 01:20:20.372
wherever you offended someone there

01:20:20.453 --> 01:20:22.596
they were the ones who had to go apologize

01:20:22.763 --> 01:20:24.450
and it was only out of sympathy for them

01:20:24.475 --> 01:20:25.736
that we tolerated your behavior

01:20:27.417 --> 01:20:29.097
I know what it feels like

01:20:29.836 --> 01:20:31.113
to see your loved ones get sick

01:20:32.958 --> 01:20:34.061
it's hard for you, true

01:20:35.188 --> 01:20:37.057
but it's even harder for the
people around you

01:20:58.307 --> 01:20:59.617
son, you can stay here tonight

01:20:59.642 --> 01:21:01.220
if you want

01:21:01.299 --> 01:21:02.903
i bought your pills

01:21:08.526 --> 01:21:09.763
the small one

01:21:10.208 --> 01:21:11.628
and the one with the red cap

01:21:11.780 --> 01:21:13.025
remember to take them together

01:21:13.050 --> 01:21:14.430
two capsules at a time

01:21:15.426 --> 01:21:16.946
wait for 30 minutes

01:21:17.677 --> 01:21:19.376
then the big one

01:21:20.043 --> 01:21:22.306
this is new, you might forget

01:21:22.942 --> 01:21:23.942
dad

01:21:33.048 --> 01:21:34.048
i eh...

01:21:35.397 --> 01:21:37.611
never laid a finger on you
since you were little

01:21:39.436 --> 01:21:40.436
now that I'm old

01:21:42.274 --> 01:21:43.634
i figured why not

01:21:47.546 --> 01:21:48.976
ever since you got sick

01:21:52.008 --> 01:21:53.008
I just

01:21:55.836 --> 01:21:57.101
couldn't bear to hear that word

01:21:57.459 --> 01:21:58.459
death

01:22:25.006 --> 01:22:26.291
I made about ten thousand

01:22:26.506 --> 01:22:28.016
driving uber on the side

01:22:28.770 --> 01:22:30.217
it should be enough for your trip

01:22:30.797 --> 01:22:31.837
I'm not going

01:22:34.948 --> 01:22:37.331
you should get this stomach thing treated

01:22:40.208 --> 01:22:42.331
we have a checkup coming up next week
employee benefit

01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:44.619
I've made appointment for a gastroscopy

01:22:44.929 --> 01:22:46.177
so, you don't have to worry

01:22:46.883 --> 01:22:47.883
you...

01:22:48.328 --> 01:22:50.664
should do something kids your age do

01:22:50.689 --> 01:22:52.323
go out and see the world

01:22:52.776 --> 01:22:53.776
however

01:22:54.442 --> 01:22:55.882
when you can leave

01:22:56.537 --> 01:22:58.286
is up to the doctor

01:23:00.660 --> 01:23:01.660
deal?

01:23:09.200 --> 01:23:11.216
the result have shown

01:23:11.692 --> 01:23:13.857
no obvious sign of reoccurrence

01:23:14.690 --> 01:23:15.706
keep taking medication

01:23:15.731 --> 01:23:17.079
and he can travel as long as

01:23:17.294 --> 01:23:18.309
it's not too tiring

01:23:19.881 --> 01:23:20.970
thank you, doctor Liu

01:23:20.995 --> 01:23:21.995
you heard that, son?

01:23:22.273 --> 01:23:23.273
i did

01:23:23.313 --> 01:23:24.313
no problem

01:23:24.445 --> 01:23:25.445
no that

01:23:25.548 --> 01:23:26.953
the siren

01:23:27.318 --> 01:23:29.709
the train is around to set off
for the distance

01:24:25.282 --> 01:24:27.781
look
why are the sheep marked?

01:24:30.309 --> 01:24:32.296
sheep are gregarious animal

01:24:32.702 --> 01:24:34.769
if they don't mark them

01:24:34.956 --> 01:24:38.333
they wouldn't know which ones are theirs
when they are all together

01:25:00.550 --> 01:25:02.025
i haven't asked you yet

01:25:04.819 --> 01:25:06.438
the girl you saw by the lake

01:25:06.463 --> 01:25:07.463
was it me?

01:25:09.026 --> 01:25:10.026
yeah

01:25:10.050 --> 01:25:11.170
are you sure?

01:25:11.910 --> 01:25:12.954
if I hadn't met you

01:25:12.979 --> 01:25:14.924
i wouldn't even know where is the lake

01:25:18.383 --> 01:25:19.532
now that you know

01:25:19.557 --> 01:25:21.168
you could go with anyone you want

01:25:22.923 --> 01:25:23.923
unlikely

01:25:30.881 --> 01:25:31.881
I'm tired

01:25:33.325 --> 01:25:34.396
let me nap for a bit

01:26:52.631 --> 01:26:54.376
Ma Xiaoyuan fainted a abruptly

01:26:55.344 --> 01:26:57.940
and our trip to Qinghai ended
in the same fashion

01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:00.472
after going through countless places

01:27:00.956 --> 01:27:03.273
the train finally stopped at a
strange platform

01:27:04.673 --> 01:27:07.407
it was til Xiaoyuan was put in an ambulance
did i suddenly realized

01:27:08.552 --> 01:27:10.855
that could the closest we ever
got to the future

01:27:12.918 --> 01:27:14.386
as for what the future holds

01:27:15.561 --> 01:27:16.601
i do not know

01:27:17.506 --> 01:27:18.825
and I don't want to, either

01:27:29.107 --> 01:27:30.368
you stay with her

01:27:31.542 --> 01:27:33.275
I'll manage here by myself

01:27:33.801 --> 01:27:35.969
Mr. Ma, the guys who's always joking around

01:27:36.970 --> 01:27:39.103
who's always acting like a child

01:27:39.827 --> 01:27:40.867
Seems to have

01:27:41.057 --> 01:27:43.001
turned into a tortured father overnight

01:27:57.180 --> 01:27:58.680
there's a hard drive on the desk

01:28:00.427 --> 01:28:02.760
that has all my pictures growing up

01:28:03.704 --> 01:28:05.381
have them developed when you get a chance

01:28:06.549 --> 01:28:08.491
so my dad would have
something to remember me by

01:28:21.303 --> 01:28:22.903
we took a short trip

01:28:23.450 --> 01:28:25.096
and you came back more negative than I am

01:28:26.858 --> 01:28:28.533
all you need is some treatment

01:28:29.938 --> 01:28:30.938
together

01:28:31.017 --> 01:28:32.716
we're gonna kick cancer's ass

01:28:35.645 --> 01:28:36.645
I'm tired

01:28:38.311 --> 01:28:39.319
you should leave

01:28:41.563 --> 01:28:42.825
look at you

01:28:44.508 --> 01:28:47.372
where was all that cockiness
from when you were trying to lecture me?

01:28:48.079 --> 01:28:49.946
why are you such a wuss now?

01:29:05.321 --> 01:29:06.321
Wei Yihang

01:29:07.790 --> 01:29:09.186
come visit me no more

01:29:10.430 --> 01:29:12.335
I'm getting my head shaved
in a couple of days

01:29:12.811 --> 01:29:14.011
it'll b hideous

01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:19.881
others may not get it
but you do, right?

01:29:22.338 --> 01:29:23.489
this spot

01:29:23.703 --> 01:29:24.903
is inoperable

01:29:25.697 --> 01:29:26.817
did it spread?

01:29:27.679 --> 01:29:29.123
insufficient intracranial space

01:29:29.822 --> 01:29:31.179
- Doctor. lin
- not now

01:29:32.592 --> 01:29:35.188
cancer can grow really fast
on young patients

01:29:36.633 --> 01:29:37.656
then what happened?

01:29:38.403 --> 01:29:39.997
still too soon to tell

01:29:40.133 --> 01:29:41.843
there are other treatments to consider

01:29:44.042 --> 01:29:45.811
she has been fine all these years

01:29:45.833 --> 01:29:47.311
how come you didn't find it earlier?

01:29:49.411 --> 01:29:51.474
didn't she get checked on a regular basis

01:29:52.173 --> 01:29:54.276
yeah, result from last time
didn't come back so well

01:29:54.301 --> 01:29:55.427
did she not tell you?

01:30:00.885 --> 01:30:02.924
Doctor Lin
my mom's result just came back,

01:30:02.949 --> 01:30:04.241
could you take look first?

01:30:04.266 --> 01:30:05.946
what is the fucking rush?

01:30:06.802 --> 01:30:08.214
can't wait to go to hell?

01:30:33.010 --> 01:30:34.050
what's wrong?

01:30:34.573 --> 01:30:35.851
ran out of ink again?

01:30:36.716 --> 01:30:38.156
let me take a look

01:30:49.185 --> 01:30:50.185
it's working

01:31:03.507 --> 01:31:04.507
the doctor told me that

01:31:05.803 --> 01:31:06.993
kids in your condition

01:31:07.018 --> 01:31:08.698
are always good looking

01:31:09.319 --> 01:31:10.439
don't know why

01:31:12.692 --> 01:31:14.120
when you were this little

01:31:14.462 --> 01:31:15.851
everything scared you

01:31:17.089 --> 01:31:18.769
a woman wearing lipstick

01:31:19.659 --> 01:31:21.095
a hallway with dim light

01:31:22.913 --> 01:31:25.095
even flying catkins from
willow trees made you cry

01:31:28.188 --> 01:31:29.378
got that from dad, i guess

01:31:29.807 --> 01:31:30.808
I used to be scared too

01:31:32.778 --> 01:31:34.398
I was afraid to the dark

01:31:35.292 --> 01:31:36.292
and cold

01:31:36.583 --> 01:31:37.583
and bugs

01:31:39.375 --> 01:31:40.479
but since I had you

01:31:40.504 --> 01:31:42.904
i became fearless, nothing scares me

01:31:45.321 --> 01:31:46.681
well, not exactly

01:31:49.557 --> 01:31:50.757
after I had you

01:31:51.550 --> 01:31:52.644
I was scared of more things

01:31:54.203 --> 01:31:55.410
that you would get sick

01:31:55.926 --> 01:31:57.235
or get bullied

01:31:58.566 --> 01:32:00.478
or get yourself into trouble

01:32:03.288 --> 01:32:04.853
and I did all those things

01:32:05.076 --> 01:32:06.250
nonsense

01:32:07.147 --> 01:32:09.575
no one has a perfect life

01:32:12.222 --> 01:32:14.626
giving birth to a child and watching him

01:32:15.659 --> 01:32:17.150
grow into a man with his own thoughts

01:32:19.270 --> 01:32:21.018
is a feeling that's so... how do I put it?

01:32:23.931 --> 01:32:26.496
like what you kids always say
after beating a video game

01:32:26.687 --> 01:32:27.687
dope

01:32:32.800 --> 01:32:34.600
what are you afraid of now?

01:32:39.774 --> 01:32:40.837
losing you

01:32:45.083 --> 01:32:46.817
how did we even get here?

01:32:47.192 --> 01:32:48.724
that's enough talk for today

01:33:02.673 --> 01:33:03.673
I'm fine

01:33:04.980 --> 01:33:06.472
what are you afraid of then, son?

01:33:11.686 --> 01:33:12.924
me...

01:33:15.083 --> 01:33:17.033
I'm afraid of being called mama's boy

01:33:17.359 --> 01:33:18.359
no

01:33:20.430 --> 01:33:21.861
you're afraid of losing her

01:33:32.557 --> 01:33:33.557
mom

01:33:37.048 --> 01:33:38.293
hypothetically speaking

01:33:39.436 --> 01:33:41.116
what would you and dad do

01:33:43.458 --> 01:33:44.458
if I'm gone?

01:33:53.559 --> 01:33:55.091
I'll go take a look at the laundry

01:34:02.851 --> 01:34:03.993
I used to believe

01:34:05.333 --> 01:34:07.462
I'd be the one to go first

01:34:08.637 --> 01:34:09.888
it never occurred to me that

01:34:11.040 --> 01:34:13.230
one day I'd be so afraid of losing someone

01:34:28.042 --> 01:34:29.519
how's Xiaoyuan going?

01:34:31.813 --> 01:34:32.813
frustrated

01:34:33.710 --> 01:34:34.750
extremely

01:34:35.559 --> 01:34:37.708
i tried to visit her
but she wouldn't even see me

01:34:41.216 --> 01:34:42.692
remember what I told you?

01:34:44.454 --> 01:34:45.563
this support group

01:34:45.875 --> 01:34:47.055
was my wife's idea

01:34:49.250 --> 01:34:51.111
she had helped so many

01:34:51.750 --> 01:34:52.888
but nobody knew that

01:34:55.173 --> 01:34:56.355
she took her own life

01:35:01.340 --> 01:35:03.319
she did, in that storage room downstairs

01:35:06.581 --> 01:35:07.901
when I found her

01:35:08.557 --> 01:35:09.900
it was too late

01:35:11.829 --> 01:35:13.509
she had suffered so much

01:35:15.628 --> 01:35:16.988
pain and miseries

01:35:20.448 --> 01:35:22.144
yet every single day she'd lead the chant

01:35:22.876 --> 01:35:24.581
" I'm not afraid of this illness "

01:35:25.645 --> 01:35:27.165
" I can defeat it "

01:35:29.549 --> 01:35:31.144
then she of all people gave up

01:35:34.581 --> 01:35:35.850
i was a fool

01:35:36.950 --> 01:35:38.220
i got so busy running business

01:35:39.708 --> 01:35:41.141
to make the money for her treatment

01:35:43.070 --> 01:35:45.270
that i left the diagnosis at home

01:35:51.097 --> 01:35:52.781
and she saw it

01:36:00.448 --> 01:36:02.226
people assumed i took ever the group

01:36:03.333 --> 01:36:04.634
out of compassion in general

01:36:05.024 --> 01:36:06.063
only i know that

01:36:06.579 --> 01:36:07.674
it's because of the guilt

01:36:10.555 --> 01:36:12.513
what I'm trying to tell you is this

01:36:13.419 --> 01:36:14.783
even the most optimistic ones

01:36:16.292 --> 01:36:17.972
can lose their senses

01:36:20.437 --> 01:36:21.477
stay with her

01:36:23.000 --> 01:36:24.119
otherwise you'll regret it

01:36:26.137 --> 01:36:27.446
alright, let's eat, I'll shut up

01:36:34.267 --> 01:36:35.767
while I got everyone here

01:36:35.833 --> 01:36:37.561
I have an announcement to make

01:36:38.167 --> 01:36:40.100
this dinner today is actually

01:36:40.514 --> 01:36:42.194
my way of saying goodbye

01:36:45.028 --> 01:36:46.440
I've been out for years

01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:50.609
it's time for me to go home
and be with my parents

01:36:51.427 --> 01:36:53.220
wait
you mean

01:36:53.762 --> 01:36:55.675
today is a going away party?

01:36:56.708 --> 01:36:58.484
the group will still be here when I'm not

01:37:03.036 --> 01:37:05.043
why can't your parents come live with you?

01:37:05.131 --> 01:37:06.131
that's right

01:37:06.156 --> 01:37:07.202
just bring them here

01:37:09.313 --> 01:37:11.811
it's been so long since
Xiao Wu's wife passed

01:37:11.851 --> 01:37:13.851
he should start a new life now

01:37:14.311 --> 01:37:15.811
that's enough
guys, quiet down, please

01:37:15.930 --> 01:37:17.739
we've had so much time through the years

01:37:18.256 --> 01:37:20.134
together we're the fire

01:37:20.349 --> 01:37:21.603
and apart we are the stars

01:37:21.667 --> 01:37:23.801
remember what we had and
keep up the good work

01:37:24.583 --> 01:37:25.583
come on

01:37:25.675 --> 01:37:26.753
let's have one last go

01:37:31.855 --> 01:37:33.085
I'm not afraid of the illness

01:37:36.561 --> 01:37:38.035
I can defeat it

01:37:40.559 --> 01:37:41.900
I'm not afraid of the illness

01:37:44.313 --> 01:37:45.721
I'm not afraid of the illness

01:37:45.928 --> 01:37:48.531
i can defeat it

01:37:48.769 --> 01:37:51.923
I'm not afraid of the illness

01:37:52.201 --> 01:37:55.121
i can defeat it

01:37:55.424 --> 01:37:58.224
I'm not afraid of the illness

01:37:58.367 --> 01:38:01.169
i can defeat it

01:38:01.360 --> 01:38:04.101
I'm not afraid of the illness

01:38:04.355 --> 01:38:07.660
i can defeat it

01:38:07.803 --> 01:38:10.838
I'm not afraid of the illness

01:38:10.966 --> 01:38:14.000
I can defeat it

01:38:15.159 --> 01:38:17.384
are we really not afraid?

01:38:17.869 --> 01:38:19.861
can we really defeat it?

01:38:20.361 --> 01:38:21.892
despite the doubts deep down

01:38:23.067 --> 01:38:24.472
i had to chant with them

01:38:25.345 --> 01:38:26.545
for Ma Xiaoyuan

01:38:27.367 --> 01:38:28.487
and for myself

01:39:31.565 --> 01:39:32.986
sir, hi
your food

01:39:35.423 --> 01:39:36.503
but I didn't order anything

01:39:36.536 --> 01:39:37.821
the order says

01:39:37.884 --> 01:39:40.526
one stewed beef with rice
delivered to the dad who sits at the curb

01:39:40.551 --> 01:39:41.769
in front of the tumor hospital

01:39:41.816 --> 01:39:44.167
looks like your daughter ordered it for you
you take a look

01:41:33.436 --> 01:41:34.436
son

01:41:34.555 --> 01:41:36.587
remember what you asked me the other day?

01:41:36.674 --> 01:41:38.693
I've discussed it many times with your dad

01:41:38.883 --> 01:41:40.836
but we couldn't bring ourselves to

01:41:40.958 --> 01:41:42.238
say it your face

01:41:42.519 --> 01:41:44.794
so we figured
why don't we make a video?

01:41:44.842 --> 01:41:46.461
it was actually my idea

01:41:46.509 --> 01:41:47.509
don't change the subject

01:41:48.263 --> 01:41:50.390
so, hypothetically speaking

01:41:50.461 --> 01:41:51.470
if you're gone

01:41:51.557 --> 01:41:52.565
knock on wood

01:41:52.590 --> 01:41:53.590
Okey

01:41:53.786 --> 01:41:55.462
if hypothetically you're gone...

01:41:56.025 --> 01:41:57.153
and it happens to be weekend

01:41:57.178 --> 01:41:58.193
your mom and I

01:41:58.218 --> 01:42:01.522
have filmed our activities of the day

01:42:02.171 --> 01:42:03.591
please enjoy

01:42:07.361 --> 01:42:08.633
10 A.M

01:42:08.856 --> 01:42:10.691
after we had breakfast

01:42:11.557 --> 01:42:13.457
you dad got me iced coffee

01:42:14.370 --> 01:42:15.554
now we're at a movie

01:42:15.872 --> 01:42:16.872
let me show you

01:42:17.309 --> 01:42:19.763
it's a horror flick
look how scared your dad is

01:42:24.968 --> 01:42:26.388
I'll show you

01:42:27.928 --> 01:42:30.209
what you mom reads everyday

01:42:33.869 --> 01:42:36.043
the Ultimate Way to Health

01:42:38.607 --> 01:42:41.407
useful Tips for Recovering Cancer Patients

01:42:41.959 --> 01:42:45.142
i think she's one article away
to becoming a Healthcare expert

01:42:45.936 --> 01:42:49.072
even the movies she saw are
about fighting cancer

01:42:50.214 --> 01:42:51.214
see?

01:42:51.944 --> 01:42:53.304
Go Away Mr. Tumor

01:42:54.204 --> 01:42:55.204
Jiang

01:42:57.673 --> 01:42:59.251
it's three o'clock in the afternoon

01:42:59.830 --> 01:43:02.097
and you mom has dragged me to this

01:43:02.342 --> 01:43:04.834
support group for families of
cancer patients

01:43:05.866 --> 01:43:06.961
see your mom there?

01:43:07.310 --> 01:43:08.584
chatting with people

01:43:09.426 --> 01:43:11.188
all these families

01:43:11.355 --> 01:43:12.881
are in the similar situations as ours

01:43:13.160 --> 01:43:15.185
you mom told them how we should

01:43:15.233 --> 01:43:16.542
stick together for comfort

01:43:17.424 --> 01:43:19.357
the thing is I'm totally fine

01:43:19.401 --> 01:43:20.694
what do I need comfort for?

01:43:21.012 --> 01:43:22.012
Wei Jiang

01:43:22.052 --> 01:43:23.052
coming

01:43:32.065 --> 01:43:33.425
son, you see him?

01:43:33.851 --> 01:43:35.131
look at your dad

01:43:35.290 --> 01:43:36.362
he thinks I'm clumsy

01:43:36.679 --> 01:43:38.567
so he went and
find himself a new dance partner

01:43:38.592 --> 01:43:39.592
leaving me all alone

01:43:39.617 --> 01:43:41.734
like I'd enjoy dancing with him
in the first place

01:43:46.080 --> 01:43:47.271
right, keep dancing with her

01:43:49.057 --> 01:43:50.989
listen
don't film us at first

01:43:51.438 --> 01:43:52.648
point the camera at that light

01:43:52.673 --> 01:43:54.596
wait till it's green
then turn around and film us

01:43:54.811 --> 01:43:55.811
no problem

01:44:00.454 --> 01:44:01.454
it's green

01:44:24.641 --> 01:44:26.256
did you get it?
yeah

01:44:26.376 --> 01:44:27.376
thank you

01:44:28.097 --> 01:44:29.288
your mom insisted we ate this

01:44:32.924 --> 01:44:34.656
is it even edible?

01:44:34.927 --> 01:44:36.024
this is like torture

01:44:36.477 --> 01:44:37.757
mild spicy, mild

01:44:38.310 --> 01:44:39.918
it'd have been medium if Yihang was here

01:44:39.943 --> 01:44:41.061
could yourself lucky

01:44:43.022 --> 01:44:44.022
waiter

01:44:44.047 --> 01:44:45.183
get me a plate of ice

01:44:45.533 --> 01:44:46.536
not ice, vinegar

01:44:46.568 --> 01:44:48.977
it can neutralize the spiciness
bring us some vinegar, please

01:44:55.069 --> 01:44:56.069
everyone in life

01:44:56.811 --> 01:44:58.091
experiences losses

01:44:59.437 --> 01:45:01.117
which we're all afraid of

01:45:02.583 --> 01:45:03.827
yet when it happens

01:45:03.852 --> 01:45:05.697
the most powerful weapon we have against it

01:45:07.929 --> 01:45:09.625
is to live each movement to the fullest

01:45:10.459 --> 01:45:11.793
every second counts

01:45:13.450 --> 01:45:15.012
that's how it is with me and your dad

01:45:16.193 --> 01:45:17.280
and that's how it should be

01:45:18.144 --> 01:45:19.155
with you and Xiaoyuan

01:45:22.598 --> 01:45:24.386
this is our last stop

01:45:29.306 --> 01:45:31.121
a perfect end to a perfect day

01:45:33.463 --> 01:45:34.712
did you not wash your feet?

01:45:35.179 --> 01:45:37.403
go wash them already like i told you

01:45:37.681 --> 01:45:39.446
you don't think Yihang you got smell feet?

01:45:39.655 --> 01:45:40.655
Harry up

01:45:59.581 --> 01:46:02.567
mom, you guys totally SLAY

01:46:36.792 --> 01:46:38.107
why did you shave your head?

01:46:38.315 --> 01:46:39.386
are you insane?

01:47:05.075 --> 01:47:06.781
from the Breakup Potion

01:47:06.851 --> 01:47:08.031
to the implacable feud

01:47:08.467 --> 01:47:09.534
from the barbecue stand

01:47:09.589 --> 01:47:11.109
to the Qinghai trip

01:47:11.295 --> 01:47:12.858
here are everything we've ever drunk

01:47:13.210 --> 01:47:15.268
i call this one the Potion of No Return

01:47:16.271 --> 01:47:17.311
i drink it up

01:47:17.563 --> 01:47:18.840
and you'll be mine forever

01:48:01.500 --> 01:48:02.527
what are you doing?

01:48:04.442 --> 01:48:05.865
from now on

01:48:07.056 --> 01:48:08.470
I'll sleep by your side every night

01:48:09.055 --> 01:48:10.665
what tuity fruity soap opera is this?

01:48:11.062 --> 01:48:12.966
whatever works for ya

01:48:13.728 --> 01:48:14.754
get out of my face now

01:48:15.211 --> 01:48:16.211
you're such a baby

01:48:26.546 --> 01:48:27.546
I'm staying

01:48:28.700 --> 01:48:29.729
good night

01:48:40.450 --> 01:48:42.917
did you not feel well before we left?

01:48:46.571 --> 01:48:47.581
felt dizzy a few times

01:48:50.161 --> 01:48:51.539
why didn't you say something then?

01:48:52.282 --> 01:48:54.942
you signed up for that drug trial thing
without telling me, either

01:48:55.587 --> 01:48:56.971
I was afraid that if I did

01:48:57.005 --> 01:48:58.315
you wouldn't have come with me

01:48:59.523 --> 01:49:00.733
and I was afraid that if I did

01:49:00.758 --> 01:49:02.174
you wouldn't have taken me with you

01:49:03.196 --> 01:49:04.203
i wanted so much

01:49:04.228 --> 01:49:06.038
to be the person with you by the lake

01:49:08.427 --> 01:49:09.427
too bad...

01:49:10.550 --> 01:49:11.550
i can't

01:49:13.206 --> 01:49:14.486
there is no me in your future

01:49:24.375 --> 01:49:26.140
you're already in it

01:49:30.069 --> 01:49:32.591
we would walk across that
beach with the great white sharks

01:49:34.040 --> 01:49:36.034
we would float together on the Dead Sea

01:49:37.375 --> 01:49:39.240
and we would visit
penguins in the Antarctica

01:49:41.601 --> 01:49:43.401
we'd go to school together

01:49:44.567 --> 01:49:45.607
then graduate

01:49:46.423 --> 01:49:47.423
get married

01:49:48.570 --> 01:49:49.607
and have children

01:49:52.095 --> 01:49:53.328
then, when we were old

01:49:53.362 --> 01:49:54.362
we'd dance in the square

01:49:55.817 --> 01:49:56.859
I've seen all these things

01:49:57.354 --> 01:49:59.034
i just didn't tell you

01:50:00.576 --> 01:50:01.576
liar

01:50:03.322 --> 01:50:05.348
those were the stupid things we did

01:50:05.864 --> 01:50:06.916
it's not the future

01:50:08.932 --> 01:50:10.612
stupid is for grownups

01:50:11.515 --> 01:50:13.684
we kids only care if we
can make them come true

01:50:15.796 --> 01:50:16.796
just wait

01:50:17.347 --> 01:50:18.347
soon

01:50:18.675 --> 01:50:20.583
I'll travel around the world with you

01:50:27.706 --> 01:50:29.440
what if we get separated?

01:50:45.193 --> 01:50:46.322
in that case

01:50:46.823 --> 01:50:47.980
you'll raise your arm

01:50:48.005 --> 01:50:49.037
standing in the crowd

01:50:49.672 --> 01:50:51.365
that way when i see this little red flower

01:50:51.390 --> 01:50:52.857
I'll come find your in no time

01:51:00.433 --> 01:51:01.679
this is some ugly drawing

01:51:09.665 --> 01:51:11.345
take me to somewhere now

01:51:27.883 --> 01:51:28.883
what are you doing?

01:51:30.073 --> 01:51:31.273
are you scared?

01:51:33.280 --> 01:51:34.605
why would I b scared?

01:51:45.433 --> 01:51:48.292
i I heard that when you die
you'll see something so bright

01:51:48.346 --> 01:51:49.768
and so warm

01:51:52.578 --> 01:51:54.302
I think it'd be kind of like what you saw

01:51:54.327 --> 01:51:56.217
during your surgery

01:52:12.803 --> 01:52:14.901
this part of the railway is abandoned

01:52:15.446 --> 01:52:17.322
so, we just lie like this forever?

01:52:19.576 --> 01:52:20.904
you shouldn't said it earlier

01:52:21.865 --> 01:52:24.361
now we're trying to get ourselves
killed on a abandoned railway

01:52:28.851 --> 01:52:30.234
can I ask you something?

01:52:31.154 --> 01:52:33.186
do you believe in parallel universes?

01:52:35.258 --> 01:52:36.471
i have some doubts

01:52:36.931 --> 01:52:38.013
I believe it

01:52:38.847 --> 01:52:41.317
somewhere there must
be a different version of you

01:52:41.635 --> 01:52:42.675
and one of me

01:52:43.209 --> 01:52:45.441
living a different version of life

01:52:45.466 --> 01:52:48.205
I don't think you get to decide
what parallel universes are like

01:52:48.912 --> 01:52:49.980
cut it

01:52:50.017 --> 01:52:51.092
I'm serious

01:52:51.131 --> 01:52:52.651
alright, keep going

01:53:13.758 --> 01:53:15.038
from that day on

01:53:15.553 --> 01:53:17.476
I had never left Ma Xiaoyuan's side

01:53:18.850 --> 01:53:19.850
until

01:53:21.145 --> 01:53:22.887
she disappeared from my future

01:53:41.341 --> 01:53:43.118
and ever since she was gone

01:53:43.302 --> 01:53:44.982
that lake in my vision

01:53:45.885 --> 01:53:47.131
has been running almost dry

01:54:41.384 --> 01:54:42.384
uncle

01:54:43.451 --> 01:54:44.451
look

01:54:49.468 --> 01:54:50.468
magic

01:54:55.032 --> 01:54:56.835
I heard this trick

01:54:57.502 --> 01:54:59.330
to make my daughter happy

01:55:02.276 --> 01:55:05.705
it'd be great if there really were

01:55:05.952 --> 01:55:07.009
magic in this world

01:55:09.065 --> 01:55:10.575
I'm handging the house over tomorrow

01:55:11.067 --> 01:55:12.610
why don't you go take a look upstairs

01:55:13.086 --> 01:55:14.766
keep anything you want

01:55:14.930 --> 01:55:16.272
something that reminds you of her

01:56:50.188 --> 01:56:51.696
one year later

01:56:51.831 --> 01:56:53.317
throughout Kafka's life

01:56:53.342 --> 01:56:55.273
he had been trying to explore

01:56:55.302 --> 01:56:57.618
the value and meaning of existence

01:56:57.678 --> 01:56:58.919
but even till the day he died

01:56:58.944 --> 01:57:01.462
he hadn't been able to come up

01:57:01.651 --> 01:57:04.451
with a satisfying conclusion to his quest

01:57:05.050 --> 01:57:06.650
that's it for today

01:57:06.758 --> 01:57:07.767
class dismissed

01:57:14.048 --> 01:57:15.048
Wei Yihang

01:57:15.430 --> 01:57:17.176
have you signed up for the summer camp?

01:57:17.201 --> 01:57:18.566
the deadline is this afternoon

01:57:18.685 --> 01:57:20.737
I'm not going
I've made my own plans

01:57:21.357 --> 01:57:22.357
thanks

01:58:04.315 --> 01:58:05.331
the lake is over there

01:58:05.529 --> 01:58:06.688
- Thanks
- be safe out there

01:58:06.784 --> 01:58:07.784
- take care
- see you

01:59:00.957 --> 01:59:01.957
Wei Yihang

01:59:26.631 --> 01:59:28.698
I've finally solved the mystery

01:59:29.724 --> 01:59:30.844
like you said

01:59:31.756 --> 01:59:34.083
those images I saw for a million times

01:59:34.346 --> 01:59:35.353
were not the future

01:59:36.139 --> 01:59:38.403
it was us in a parallel universe

01:59:39.761 --> 01:59:42.477
a world without pain and sadness

01:59:43.792 --> 01:59:44.792
over there

01:59:45.478 --> 01:59:46.789
Tao Hui and Wei Jiang

01:59:46.814 --> 01:59:48.681
have a perfectly healthy son

01:59:50.049 --> 01:59:52.084
and they don't have a worry in the world

01:59:52.886 --> 01:59:54.468
they could care less

01:59:54.532 --> 01:59:56.212
about the mundane world

01:59:57.531 --> 01:59:59.789
i told you,you can't let
customers put things on the cuff

01:59:59.814 --> 02:00:01.186
and yet you let Lao Li do it again

02:00:01.282 --> 02:00:02.875
he's my buddy

02:00:02.946 --> 02:00:04.494
Mr. and Mrs. Ma

02:00:04.692 --> 02:00:06.446
also have a perfectly healthy daughter

02:00:07.351 --> 02:00:09.398
they fight almost everyday

02:00:09.843 --> 02:00:13.120
so their daughter wears
her headset all the time

02:00:15.151 --> 02:00:16.999
the father siting in
the front of the hospital

02:00:17.302 --> 02:00:19.150
didn't lose her daughter

02:00:19.778 --> 02:00:23.035
they went and tried every delicious
treat to the world has to offer

02:00:25.305 --> 02:00:26.763
and the old lady waiting in the rain

02:00:27.184 --> 02:00:29.272
never lost her grandson

02:00:30.011 --> 02:00:31.660
it is her happiest moment of the day

02:00:31.685 --> 02:00:34.352
when she goes picking him up from school

02:00:35.330 --> 02:00:36.330
Hangu
Tanggu

02:00:36.512 --> 02:00:38.156
to Tianjin
in the southeast corner

02:00:38.211 --> 02:00:39.230
Dong Men Gong Yin Hao

02:00:39.342 --> 02:00:40.349
and there's Wu Xiaomei

02:00:40.556 --> 02:00:42.063
he's a stand up comedian

02:00:42.461 --> 02:00:44.018
everyday after practice

02:00:44.065 --> 02:00:45.073
his wife will make him

02:00:45.098 --> 02:00:46.306
a big bowl of

02:00:46.354 --> 02:00:48.052
white fungus soup with lotus seeds

02:00:48.068 --> 02:00:49.935
which is good for his throat

02:00:52.928 --> 02:00:55.745
there never was a support
group for cancer patients, either

02:00:56.357 --> 02:00:58.698
everyone is living a life of their dreams

02:00:59.646 --> 02:01:00.646
simple

02:01:00.932 --> 02:01:01.939
and be beautiful

02:01:02.083 --> 02:01:03.376
one early morn

02:01:03.853 --> 02:01:04.926
my sun did shine

02:01:05.069 --> 02:01:07.936
with all triumphant splendor on my brow

02:01:09.690 --> 02:01:11.050
as for you and me

02:01:11.852 --> 02:01:13.734
we are running through the infinity of time

02:01:14.576 --> 02:01:15.576
from now

02:01:15.840 --> 02:01:17.136
to eternity

02:01:18.057 --> 02:01:19.737
we cherish every instant

02:01:19.926 --> 02:01:21.229
we barely talk to each other

02:01:21.848 --> 02:01:23.144
but we are always smiling

02:01:24.176 --> 02:01:25.557
we jog

02:01:25.645 --> 02:01:26.645
and we leap

02:01:26.946 --> 02:01:28.680
living our lives care free

02:01:29.131 --> 02:01:30.594
and we're never be apart

02:01:31.428 --> 02:01:32.779
with no fear

02:01:32.859 --> 02:01:33.979
or disturbance

02:01:36.438 --> 02:01:37.446
FOREVER

02:01:38.256 --> 02:01:39.256
AND EVER.
