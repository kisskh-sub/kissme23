WEBVTT

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:10.060
Bitch.

00:00:11.270 --> 00:00:12.380
You've got some nerve.

00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:17.050
Daring to impersonate the chemist

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.620
and steal my business?

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:21.140
I really don't know anything.

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.460
I don't know anything.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:31.900
Don't know?

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:39.770
Do you really think

00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.370
I don't know about your things

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:42.620
with Wang Bo?

00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:45.260
He killed Chen Chuchuan,

00:00:45.640 --> 00:00:46.370
got Nuo Sha's

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:47.620
contact details,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.220
and gave them to you.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.330
And what do you do?

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:52.540
You pull

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:54.730
a sneak attack on me.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:56.730
My godfather said

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:59.090
you need a lesson.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.010
You love playing, huh?

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:04.490
Then enjoy it.

00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.330
No!

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:53.060
[Episode 20]

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:05.610
X5

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:07.850
has a positive effect

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:10.340
on inducing norepinephrine

00:03:10.630 --> 00:03:12.010
and serotonin.

00:03:12.470 --> 00:03:14.380
The experimental data is perfect,

00:03:14.630 --> 00:03:16.570
providing new ideas

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:17.850
for practical applications.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.500
X5?

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:21.260
Norepinephrine?

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.610
The depression rate

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.340
stands at

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:25.060
five percent.

00:03:25.310 --> 00:03:26.850
It has become a global

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:27.540
health crisis,

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:29.610
and it's getting worse.

00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:31.540
But I think

00:03:32.630 --> 00:03:33.260
depression

00:03:33.910 --> 00:03:34.730
is preventable

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:35.980
and treatable.

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:38.410
It just lacks policy attention

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.570
and social resources.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:41.260
My research shows

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.010
norepinephrine

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:45.380
is effective

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.260
against depression.

00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:49.940
Mr. Qi.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.100
Li Shuting's

00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:52.100
drug test results are in.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.980
He was on anti-manic meds.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.010
During this operation,

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.100
we found a drug lab

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.410
and research materials

00:04:14.630 --> 00:04:15.340
at the factory.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:16.490
We interrogated

00:04:16.510 --> 00:04:17.780
the people at the factory.

00:04:18.310 --> 00:04:19.580
The factory belongs to Zhengxi.

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:20.660
We all listen to him.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:21.980
We do whatever

00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:22.900
he tells us to do.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:24.580
He's the boss.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.700
Never goes out for work.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:27.980
Just researches

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.290
in the factory.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.410
Originally, we didn't know

00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:32.170
what he was doing.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:33.730
Later, we found out

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:34.930
it was drugs.

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.100
I don't know about chemists.

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:39.850
He makes us

00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.100
call him Mr. Feng.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.410
But we call him Old Poison in private.

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:44.610
He's venomous.

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:48.730
Aside from Chen Chuchuan and Feng Zhengxi,

00:04:51.070 --> 00:04:51.610
I don't know

00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.780
who else could supply it.

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:56.850
The items

00:04:56.870 --> 00:04:57.490
from the factory

00:04:57.510 --> 00:04:58.580
have been tested.

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:01.140
Same substance

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.660
in wine

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.730
as in Mr. Han's sample.

00:05:03.430 --> 00:05:05.170
The toxicology results are consistent.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:07.700
What they're making

00:05:08.070 --> 00:05:08.660
is the new drug

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:09.780
we've been looking for.

00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:11.930
Mr. Qi.

00:05:21.310 --> 00:05:22.370
I don't have much

00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:23.660
to report for now.

00:05:25.270 --> 00:05:26.540
Let's divide the tasks.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:27.980
Okay.

00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:41.170
Hi, Mr. Qi.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:42.580
Xiaoxi,

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:43.900
could you

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.730
check someone's entry

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:45.610
and exit records?

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:46.780
Sure.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:03.580
Mr. Qi,

00:06:04.070 --> 00:06:05.100
she's been in He City.

00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:06.050
No exit record.

00:06:48.310 --> 00:06:48.930
(Li Ming!)

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.220
This is your exam subject, right?

00:06:52.680 --> 00:06:54.220
Memorize the notes

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.540
in this book,

00:06:55.950 --> 00:06:56.700
and you'll pass.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:58.780
You're a real pal.

00:06:59.830 --> 00:07:00.730
Study hard.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.050
Don't fail again.

00:07:31.070 --> 00:07:31.540
What's up?

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:34.850
This notebook was found

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:35.900
at the factory.

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.250
Wu Yongchang left me this note

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:39.810
in college.

00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:41.460
Wu Yongchang?

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:43.170
Get an expert

00:07:43.510 --> 00:07:44.580
to verify the handwriting.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:49.050
Another strange thing.

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:53.220
This book

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:54.700
was left by my bedside

00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:55.780
three years ago

00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.140
when I was in a coma.

00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.410
But today at home,

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.490
I found it

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:01.410
and remembered

00:08:02.310 --> 00:08:03.460
I gave this to Li Ming

00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:04.610
back in college.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:20.930
What's this?

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.100
A chemical formula.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:54.100
It's confirmed

00:08:54.630 --> 00:08:56.250
that this is Li Ming's handwriting.

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:58.650
Probably he was the one who left

00:08:58.670 --> 00:08:59.300
the book.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:00.850
But now

00:09:00.870 --> 00:09:01.980
it's impossible to verify.

00:09:04.600 --> 00:09:05.340
Why did he

00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:06.770
send you a formula?

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:09.130
It must be

00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.820
what the drug ring

00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:11.980
has been searching for.

00:09:12.550 --> 00:09:13.610
They need

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:14.820
this molecular formula

00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:17.100
to produce the final drug.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:18.370
So they've

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:19.460
been experimenting

00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:20.610
on people.

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:23.820
Han Feng,

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:25.940
could you

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.130
give me the details

00:09:27.910 --> 00:09:28.700
about how you solved

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:29.700
the Raw Diamond case?

00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.420
The goods?

00:09:39.150 --> 00:09:40.220
(Soon after infiltrating)

00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.220
(Cha Kun's operation,)

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.940
(I ran into Li Ming)

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:43.940
(during a deal.)

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:48.250
And the money?

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:00.300
(An anonymous call)

00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.460
(came in)

00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.730
with the exact location

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:04.610
of the drug factory.

00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:09.770
Mr. Guan and I teamed up

00:10:09.790 --> 00:10:10.980
and took them all down.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.980
Thinking back,

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:14.130
it went rather well.

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:15.420
I still remember

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:16.250
Li Ming's expression.

00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.060
Police?

00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:20.180
You're setting me up!

00:10:34.630 --> 00:10:35.130
Go!

00:10:41.630 --> 00:10:43.610
(Li Ming died that day.)

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:48.060
Did you find out

00:10:48.750 --> 00:10:49.610
who made

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:50.530
that call?

00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:53.340
No.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.220
And Wu Yongchang?

00:10:57.120 --> 00:10:58.340
Has his handwriting

00:10:58.600 --> 00:10:59.460
been identified?

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:03.700
Yes.

00:11:04.390 --> 00:11:05.220
Your teacher

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:07.220
might be connected

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:07.940
to this case.

00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:09.890
Besides,

00:11:10.150 --> 00:11:11.220
Wang Bo has confessed

00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:12.890
to the drug ring's structure.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:15.420
Our drugs

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.650
all came from Feng Zhengxi's lab.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:19.250
Chen Chuchuan

00:11:19.510 --> 00:11:20.940
got his drugs from there too.

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:22.460
But he wasn't involved

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:23.530
in the trade.

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:25.530
His job

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.340
was finding lab rats.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:28.700
Lab rats?

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.490
Human guinea pigs.

00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:32.650
What role

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:33.890
Wu Yongchang plays

00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:35.980
remains unclear.

00:11:37.270 --> 00:11:39.300
I'll go to the school tomorrow

00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:41.370
to talk to Wu Yongchang.

00:11:41.790 --> 00:11:42.460
I'll go with you.

00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:43.420
No need.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.340
We should avoid alerting him.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.580
I'm just going

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:49.890
to feel him out.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:51.980
Alright.

00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:53.730
I'll report to Mr. Bai.

00:11:54.390 --> 00:11:54.980
Be careful.

00:11:55.630 --> 00:11:56.610
Stay in touch.

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:57.610
Yeah.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.300
Sizhe?

00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:30.370
Mr. Wu.

00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:37.940
The three of us

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:40.980
always see you as a father.

00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:44.180
Mr. Wu.

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:48.850
Can we

00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.130
talk honestly today,

00:12:51.670 --> 00:12:52.770
like family?

00:12:56.840 --> 00:12:57.370
Go ahead.

00:12:58.750 --> 00:12:59.460
Among the drugs

00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:01.250
Chen Chuchuan

00:13:01.270 --> 00:13:02.180
gave his patients,

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:03.610
some were

00:13:03.630 --> 00:13:05.100
experimental drugs.

00:13:05.670 --> 00:13:06.220
And

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.770
we confirmed

00:13:07.790 --> 00:13:08.820
your handwriting

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:10.730
in the research notes

00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:13.460
from the drug lab.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.100
My notes

00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:17.010
were misused?

00:13:17.750 --> 00:13:18.300
By whom?

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:20.530
Don't you know this?

00:13:21.030 --> 00:13:21.890
How would I know?

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:23.420
What about Mrs. Wu?

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.180
We checked it.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:28.890
She has never

00:13:28.910 --> 00:13:29.940
left the country.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:31.700
Where's she?

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:38.940
I'll take you somewhere.

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:40.770
Then you'll know.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:09.180
Yongchang.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:12.180
See who's here.

00:14:13.870 --> 00:14:14.820
Sizhe.

00:14:15.390 --> 00:14:17.060
Since Sizhe came to visit you,

00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:19.130
I'm taking you home today.

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:20.340
Good!

00:14:20.910 --> 00:14:21.700
Sizhe, go.

00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.130
Okay.

00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:22.940
Let's go.

00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:42.820
Mr. Wu,

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:44.890
how did Mrs. Wu

00:14:44.910 --> 00:14:46.130
develop depression?

00:14:48.390 --> 00:14:49.980
I'm not sure.

00:14:51.550 --> 00:14:52.850
One day I came home

00:14:53.480 --> 00:14:55.180
and found she had taken many sleeping pills.

00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:56.650
Guifen?

00:14:58.910 --> 00:14:59.490
Guifen?

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:03.490
An ambulance!

00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:04.980
I need an ambulance!

00:15:06.390 --> 00:15:07.700
She got many prescriptions,

00:15:08.790 --> 00:15:09.980
but none worked well.

00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:11.060
So from then on,

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:13.370
I tried to develop

00:15:13.670 --> 00:15:14.650
new medication.

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:16.730
I didn't mean to hide it,

00:15:18.480 --> 00:15:20.770
but private development

00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:21.980
is illegal.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:23.850
How could I tell you?

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:26.580
But

00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.610
I never produced drugs.

00:15:30.630 --> 00:15:31.250
It wrecks lives.

00:15:31.270 --> 00:15:32.420
I know that.

00:15:33.910 --> 00:15:34.490
Li Ming

00:15:35.750 --> 00:15:37.130
was killed by drugs.

00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:43.940
And Chen Chuchuan?

00:15:46.750 --> 00:15:47.770
How much do you know

00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:49.060
about Chen Chuchuan?

00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.130
Chuchuan...

00:15:53.670 --> 00:15:54.980
He also had depression.

00:15:55.790 --> 00:15:56.340
Chuchuan,

00:15:57.030 --> 00:15:58.060
I'm developing

00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:00.130
a drug for depression.

00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.770
Once it's ready,

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.340
I'm sure you'll be healed.

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:06.370
Don't give up on yourself,

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:06.980
okay?

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:11.530
Healers often can't

00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:14.060
heal themselves.

00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:15.890
Mr. Wu,

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.250
I can cure many,

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:21.890
but I can't

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:22.820
cure myself.

00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:23.890
I know.

00:16:27.910 --> 00:16:29.250
But I don't know

00:16:29.270 --> 00:16:30.730
how he got involved

00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:32.940
with drugs.

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:42.890
Mr. Wu.

00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:46.130
Are you still

00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:47.300
developing that drug?

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:48.610
No.

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:49.730
I gave up a long time ago.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.130
Has anyone suspicious

00:16:53.790 --> 00:16:54.940
contacted you recently?

00:16:54.960 --> 00:16:55.610
contacted you?

00:16:57.150 --> 00:16:58.300
Suspicious?

00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:01.370
Well... I think there was one.

00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:02.340
I don't know

00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:02.980
how he

00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.180
got the information.

00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.420
He said

00:17:06.510 --> 00:17:07.730
he wanted

00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.250
to give me a lab.

00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.090
How could I dare?

00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:12.180
Thinking about

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.220
what happened to Li Ming,

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:14.290
I was scared.

00:17:14.830 --> 00:17:16.010
So I turned him down.

00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:17.460
Mr. Wu,

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:19.380
what does he

00:17:19.400 --> 00:17:20.380
look like?

00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:23.420
Not fat.

00:17:24.030 --> 00:17:24.860
Bug-eyed.

00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:26.730
Slicked-back hair.

00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:29.660
Take a look.

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.980
Is it him?

00:17:35.310 --> 00:17:36.730
Yes. It's him!

00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:43.490
Looks like

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:45.180
Mr. Wu is a suspect.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.530
But his explanation

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.220
is reasonable.

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.290
(Feng Zhengxi contacted him.)

00:17:54.030 --> 00:17:54.660
I got the number

00:17:54.680 --> 00:17:55.660
Feng Zhengxi used

00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:56.460
to contact him.

00:17:57.160 --> 00:17:57.700
Go ahead.

00:18:06.480 --> 00:18:06.900
Xiaoxi.

00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:08.290
Check this number.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:08.900
Yes.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:10.290
If what he said

00:18:10.310 --> 00:18:11.570
is true,

00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:12.860
I'll send people to watch him

00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:14.250
to prevent Feng Zhengxi

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:15.460
from harming him.

00:18:15.750 --> 00:18:16.660
Has Su found

00:18:17.350 --> 00:18:18.730
any info on Feng Zhengxi?

00:18:19.270 --> 00:18:19.900
Su...

00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:22.330
How's it?

00:18:22.750 --> 00:18:23.290
Nothing found.

00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:24.770
I'll keep you posted.

00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:28.660
Mr. Han,

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:30.220
the number is disconnected.

00:18:34.510 --> 00:18:34.940
Su,

00:18:35.510 --> 00:18:37.140
look into the sanatorium
where Wu Yongchang's wife

00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:37.770
lives now.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:38.700
See if he's

00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.490
drugging his wife.

00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:40.250
Yes.

00:18:54.550 --> 00:18:55.530
Wu Yongchang is missing.

00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:28.330
We analyzed

00:19:28.350 --> 00:19:29.330
the blood samples

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.380
from Wu Yongchang's home.

00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.420
They are from

00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:33.180
Wu Yongchang and Lin Guifen.

00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:35.250
The kidnapper could be Feng Zhengxi.

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:37.290
But we can't

00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:38.420
locate him yet.

00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:40.900
Mobilize all units.

00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:43.010
Launch a manhunt for Feng Zhengxi immediately.

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.180
Based on the current
drug manufacturing logic

00:19:59.310 --> 00:20:00.940
and the molecular formula

00:20:00.960 --> 00:20:02.220
provided by Li Ming,

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.460
the drug ring

00:20:04.510 --> 00:20:05.250
is searching for

00:20:05.270 --> 00:20:06.180
this formula.

00:20:06.550 --> 00:20:07.700
Their goal

00:20:08.350 --> 00:20:09.290
is to manufacture

00:20:09.310 --> 00:20:10.530
the new drug.

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:11.420
Hence,

00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:12.530
if we show

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:13.860
the book with Li Ming's clue

00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:15.530
to the public

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:16.700
and claim

00:20:17.030 --> 00:20:18.290
it's a clue

00:20:18.550 --> 00:20:19.460
left by Mr. K

00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:20.290
in the Raw Diamond case,

00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:21.140
I guess

00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.220
it will attract

00:20:22.270 --> 00:20:23.380
the drug ring's attention.

00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.530
If they want the formula,

00:20:26.310 --> 00:20:27.570
they will make a move.

00:20:32.110 --> 00:20:32.570
Everyone,

00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.770
this is what we got

00:20:36.030 --> 00:20:38.250
from the Raw Diamond case.

00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:45.940
Besides these drugs,

00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.380
we seized

00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:48.810
the drug notes

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:50.730
of Mr. K.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.140
Mr. Bai,

00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.380
it's risky for Qi Sizhe

00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:51.490
to go solo.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:52.380
Right.

00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:53.290
Too dangerous.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:54.380
I don't agree.

00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:55.420
Mr. Han,

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:56.490
Mr. Cao,

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:57.530
Mr. Bai,

00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.730
what they want most

00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.460
is the chemical formula

00:22:01.480 --> 00:22:02.330
for this new drug.

00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:03.810
Therefore,

00:22:04.070 --> 00:22:05.490
before they get it,

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:06.770
they shouldn't harm me.

00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.090
What's more,

00:22:09.350 --> 00:22:10.530
this operation determines

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:11.530
whether we can soon

00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:12.810
get to the bottom

00:22:13.510 --> 00:22:14.570
of this case.

00:22:15.270 --> 00:22:16.660
That's why I volunteer.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.420
This matters greatly

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:19.940
to the team

00:22:20.590 --> 00:22:21.460
and to me.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:57.380
Han Feng.

00:22:57.590 --> 00:22:59.250
You follow Qi Sizhe.

00:22:59.640 --> 00:22:59.980
Got it.

00:23:00.510 --> 00:23:01.330
(Lixing, Yuanyang,)

00:23:01.550 --> 00:23:02.860
you two move parallel to his car

00:23:03.270 --> 00:23:05.220
from the east and west.

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.330
Be ready to flank him.

00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:07.570
Yes.

00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:24.140
Where's Mr. Wu?

00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:26.250
Don't move.

00:24:27.590 --> 00:24:28.010
Put it on.

00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:39.700
Turn right.

00:24:48.110 --> 00:24:48.530
Hurry up.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:52.420
Turn around.

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:54.770
Hands behind you.

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:15.050
Turn left ahead.

00:25:59.240 --> 00:25:59.730
Turn right.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:45.330
Su.

00:26:46.240 --> 00:26:47.140
Check every crossing.

00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:48.050
Get Xiaoxi on the cams.

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:48.860
Yes.

00:26:48.880 --> 00:26:49.530
Let's grill Wu Ya.

00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:54.860
Do you have a partner

00:26:54.880 --> 00:26:55.620
in He City?

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:58.090
Know him?

00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:00.460
Tell us.

00:27:11.310 --> 00:27:12.290
His name is Sen.

00:27:13.790 --> 00:27:15.180
He's Nuo Sha's most trusted man.

00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:17.420
We used the formula

00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:18.530
to lure the drug ring.

00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:19.980
Why did he come?

00:27:20.790 --> 00:27:21.530
Is he with Nuo Sha,

00:27:21.550 --> 00:27:22.530
or with the chemist?

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:25.420
How would I know?

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:26.490
You've had me

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:27.250
locked up here.

00:27:27.350 --> 00:27:27.810
Maybe Nuo Sha

00:27:27.830 --> 00:27:28.460
connected with

00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:29.250
the drug ring.

00:27:30.360 --> 00:27:30.860
Wu Ya,

00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.930
I'll give you one more chance.

00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:34.540
How to contact Sen?

00:27:34.790 --> 00:27:35.260
Answer us!

00:28:19.550 --> 00:28:20.250
He's here.

00:28:21.310 --> 00:28:22.180
(Give me two days.)

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:24.180
(When I get the formula,)

00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:25.010
(deal's on.)

00:29:48.270 --> 00:29:48.940
Shut up!

00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:51.090
(Stay quiet if you want drugs.)

00:29:51.550 --> 00:29:52.770
(Bunch of addicts.)

00:30:06.590 --> 00:30:07.090
Mr. Wu?

00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:08.460
Mr. Wu!

00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:10.490
Sizhe.

00:30:10.510 --> 00:30:11.050
Get up.

00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:15.330
They got you too?

00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:17.900
And Mrs. Wu?

00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:20.010
I don't know where she is.

00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:22.980
Sizhe,

00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:24.900
he's the man

00:30:25.030 --> 00:30:25.570
you're hunting.

00:30:28.640 --> 00:30:29.180
Come on.

00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:30.620
Making a movie?

00:30:31.440 --> 00:30:32.290
Well, continue.

00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:34.180
Let me see how touching it is.

00:30:36.480 --> 00:30:37.140
Feng Zhengxi,

00:30:38.350 --> 00:30:39.860
you've already got me.

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:41.180
Let my teacher go.

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:44.290
Let him go?

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:45.810
Don't be naive.

00:30:47.110 --> 00:30:48.380
If not for you,

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:50.010
my glass factory would be fine!

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:53.140
Feng Zhengxi!

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:56.980
Take it out on me!

00:30:57.790 --> 00:30:59.460
If you're really devoted,

00:30:59.830 --> 00:31:00.620
then give me

00:31:00.640 --> 00:31:01.940
Mr. K's diary.

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:03.460
Otherwise,

00:31:05.510 --> 00:31:06.010
I'll kill

00:31:06.030 --> 00:31:07.250
your teacher.

00:31:11.110 --> 00:31:11.770
Feng Zhengxi!

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:15.570
If you still want

00:31:15.590 --> 00:31:17.490
that formula,

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:19.570
don't act rashly.

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:36.460
Just kidding.

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:38.770
Your teacher

00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:40.050
is important to me.

00:31:40.590 --> 00:31:41.770
How would I harm him?

00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:46.660
But no guarantees

00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:48.010
about the guys out there.

00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:49.620
What do you want?

00:31:59.590 --> 00:32:00.090
Go!

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:05.570
Open up.

00:32:05.790 --> 00:32:07.290
Open up!

00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.010
Mr. Qi,

00:32:50.200 --> 00:32:51.700
give me the formula.

00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:53.420
Or else

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:56.090
the others will end up like her.

00:32:56.790 --> 00:32:57.490
Think about it.

00:33:05.350 --> 00:33:06.700
Even if you get Sen,

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:07.380
it's too late.

00:33:08.070 --> 00:33:09.180
They must have handed him

00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:10.420
over to the drug ring.

00:33:10.550 --> 00:33:10.980
Shut up.

00:33:11.550 --> 00:33:12.180
No tricks.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.900
Sen, here.

00:33:48.550 --> 00:33:50.140
I brought you a partner.

00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:52.530
He's one of us. Don't worry.

00:34:25.190 --> 00:34:25.650
Han Feng!

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:26.570
Stop!

00:34:29.670 --> 00:34:30.090
Move!

00:34:30.480 --> 00:34:30.900
Mr. Han.

00:34:32.030 --> 00:34:32.780
Are you okay?

00:34:33.440 --> 00:34:33.860
I'm fine.

00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:34.900
After Wu Ya!

00:34:35.280 --> 00:34:35.690
Okay.

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:43.570
Han Feng!

00:34:44.110 --> 00:34:44.650
Don't run!

00:35:17.110 --> 00:35:17.940
Sen!

00:35:18.710 --> 00:35:19.610
Help me!

00:35:20.630 --> 00:35:21.210
General...

00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:26.570
What do we do?

00:35:31.030 --> 00:35:31.940
Sen!

00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:34.690
What do we do now?

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:36.300
Save him!

00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:24.090
Move!

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:29.210
Stop!

00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:29.690
Freeze!

00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:30.690
- Stop! - Go!

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:31.380
- Get down! - Stop!

00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:32.900
Get down!

00:36:33.230 --> 00:36:33.690
Get down!

00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:42.420
Move them.

00:36:42.840 --> 00:36:43.170
Get up!

00:36:43.440 --> 00:36:43.820
Get up!

00:36:44.800 --> 00:36:45.090
Go!

00:36:45.150 --> 00:36:45.570
Go!

00:37:29.230 --> 00:37:29.900
Get over there!

00:37:58.840 --> 00:37:59.900
He killed my brother!

00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:00.860
I will

00:38:01.110 --> 00:38:01.940
avenge him.

00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:02.980
Your brother dealt drugs.

00:38:03.190 --> 00:38:04.340
I arrest every dealer I find!

00:38:04.920 --> 00:38:06.380
Do you really think I won't kill him?

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:07.090
Si Zhe!

00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:07.650
Mrs. Wu!

00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:08.380
Si Zhe!

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:09.780
Sorry! It's all my fault!

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:10.380
Mrs. Wu!

00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.130
After talks,

00:38:11.150 --> 00:38:13.420
Mr. Bai and I have approved

00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:14.460
Han Feng's undercover op.

00:38:14.630 --> 00:38:15.420
Nuo Sha?

00:38:15.630 --> 00:38:16.820
Old man.

00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:19.010
If the formula is correct,

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:20.340
there shouldn't be a problem.

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:21.260
Move now.

00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:22.610
Shut down the drug factory

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:23.740
as soon as possible.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.170
Bring Han Feng and Qi Sizhe

00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:26.610
back safely.

00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:28.490
Evacuate the hostages!

00:38:29.110 --> 00:38:29.570
Drop it!

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:30.690
Drop it!
