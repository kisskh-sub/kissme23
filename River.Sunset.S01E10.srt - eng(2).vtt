WEBVTT

00:01:46.840 --> 00:01:49.200
Biying, hurry up and eat.

00:01:53.879 --> 00:01:54.640
Dad.

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.039
Your return was supposed to be a happy occasion.

00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.400
Look at you.

00:02:36.759 --> 00:02:37.319
What you're wearing...

00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.400
I hardly recognize you.

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:42.759
This is all I can wear now.

00:02:49.639 --> 00:02:51.680
Ever since the Japanese occupied Sanzao Island,

00:02:52.719 --> 00:02:54.439
I often talk to your mother's photo.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:56.599
I tell her not to worry.

00:02:58.199 --> 00:03:00.000
I will hold on until you return.

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.960
To see you living a happy life.

00:03:04.759 --> 00:03:06.000
And now I've finally waited for you to come back.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.120
Yes, I'm back.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.400
But you come back with a Japanese man.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.280
And your actions...

00:03:18.599 --> 00:03:19.599
They confuse me greatly.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.280
Tell me honestly.

00:03:25.199 --> 00:03:27.240
What have you been doing all these years?

00:03:30.439 --> 00:03:31.759
I went to Shanghai.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.080
Weren't you up north?

00:03:34.759 --> 00:03:36.039
How did you end up in Shanghai?

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.840
Dad, please don't ask.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:41.439
You must believe your daughter acts on principle.

00:03:42.599 --> 00:03:43.879
Everything I do

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.000
is to allow more people

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000
to survive.

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.960
Do you have something you want to tell me?

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.080
Dad?

00:04:11.639 --> 00:04:13.759
Is the family hiding something from me?

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:28.240
Come on, let's eat.

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:32.879
I'm finished eating.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.120
I have something to attend to, I need to go out.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:51.759
Dad.

00:04:51.959 --> 00:04:53.240
I didn't say anything.

00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:58.079
I'm finished too.

00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:36.120
Hello?

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:37.920
What's the mission today?

00:05:38.079 --> 00:05:38.920
Reporting, Colonel.

00:05:39.199 --> 00:05:39.920
Today's mission is

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:42.240
to attack the Yuehan Line and Jiangcun Railway Bridge.

00:05:42.519 --> 00:05:42.839
Proceed.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:43.319
Yes, sir.

00:05:46.639 --> 00:05:47.600
According to the plan,

00:05:48.079 --> 00:05:50.040
Takeki must survey the island's

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:51.720
entire terrain

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:54.079
and the garrison's deployment today.

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.279
Meanwhile, Ye Biying

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:59.000
should also visit relatives and friends on the island,

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.639
secretly inquiring about the courier's whereabouts.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:05.000
But the sentry who appeared suddenly last night

00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000
has disrupted all these plans.

00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.639
Search this area again.

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:28.839
How can we not even find the body?

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:36.519
What is it?

00:06:38.279 --> 00:06:41.040
Is Colonel Takeki here?

00:06:41.040 --> 00:06:42.000
What?

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.199
Takeki?

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:45.040
Go, go, go! Step back!

00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.199
Miss Ye!

00:06:49.879 --> 00:06:50.759
You came at the right time.

00:06:50.759 --> 00:06:51.360
Ask him for me,

00:06:51.360 --> 00:06:52.680
is Colonel Takeki here?

00:06:52.839 --> 00:06:53.879
Alright.

00:06:56.279 --> 00:06:57.759
Excuse me.

00:06:57.759 --> 00:06:58.360
This Miss Ye

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.680
is the assistant Colonel Takeki brought to the island.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.519
She has business with Colonel Takeki.

00:07:00.519 --> 00:07:01.439
Is the Colonel at the airport barracks now?

00:07:02.759 --> 00:07:03.240
No.

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:05.920
He's not here? I...

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.639
Then ask him for me, where did he go?

00:07:08.959 --> 00:07:10.639
Where did he go?

00:07:10.639 --> 00:07:12.600
He said he was going out for a walk.

00:07:12.879 --> 00:07:14.399
He didn't say where.

00:07:14.879 --> 00:07:17.360
But the car headed towards Fortress Hill.

00:07:18.079 --> 00:07:18.759
Thank you.

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.600
He said Colonel Takeki

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.959
went towards Fortress Hill.

00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:23.360
Fortress Hill?

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:24.120
I...

00:08:00.399 --> 00:08:01.920
Takeki knows

00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:04.040
this is the rendezvous point

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.079
for the second evacuation plan arranged by Director Shen.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.040
But Director Shen doesn't know

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:13.079
there's also a concealed anti-aircraft gun post here.

00:08:14.800 --> 00:08:15.439
Colonel.

00:08:24.879 --> 00:08:25.560
Colonel.

00:08:29.319 --> 00:08:30.360
Bring the binoculars.

00:08:44.799 --> 00:08:45.639
How far is it from here to Macau, China?

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.399
Reporting, Colonel.

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:47.720
Thirteen nautical miles.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:48.840
That direction.

00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:50.519
At night, you can see the lights of Macau, China.

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:58.759
Good work.

00:08:59.039 --> 00:08:59.440
Yes, sir.

00:09:30.039 --> 00:09:31.080
What's wrong?

00:09:32.080 --> 00:09:33.320
Can you promise me one thing?

00:09:33.639 --> 00:09:33.879
Hmm?

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:35.360
No matter what happens,

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.200
you will definitely protect my family's safety.

00:09:38.919 --> 00:09:39.919
My father's,

00:09:39.919 --> 00:09:41.720
Nanny's, and my brother's.

00:09:44.799 --> 00:09:46.559
Even if it's just to let you work with peace of mind,

00:09:46.879 --> 00:09:48.600
I will definitely do this.

00:09:49.559 --> 00:09:50.480
You promise?

00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.799
I promise.

00:10:01.559 --> 00:10:03.919
This is a U.S. military portable, disposable

00:10:03.919 --> 00:10:05.360
morphine injector needle.

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:07.720
Produced by the U.S. military's Squibb company.

00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:08.600
A "Surette" needle.

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:10.120
Where was it found?

00:10:10.639 --> 00:10:11.399
At Nanny's old home.

00:10:14.399 --> 00:10:15.919
Can we speculate like this:

00:10:16.799 --> 00:10:18.679
Your nanny rescued that American pilot

00:10:18.679 --> 00:10:19.919
and hid him in her own home?

00:10:20.799 --> 00:10:21.720
That doesn't make sense either.

00:10:22.080 --> 00:10:23.279
With such a large-scale Japanese military search,

00:10:23.279 --> 00:10:24.080
they actually didn't find him?

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.600
It wasn't just my nanny, was it?

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.519
Let's go. We're going to your house now.

00:10:32.519 --> 00:10:33.360
I'll talk to your father.

00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.080
Wait.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.720
I haven't had a chance to tell you.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.960
This morning, my father took me to see the Mass Grave.

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.759
This morning, my father took me to see the Mass Grave.

00:10:39.919 --> 00:10:42.240
The Japanese army carried out a massacre on the island.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:44.120
Over ten thousand villagers died.

00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:45.039
Not just my father,

00:10:45.039 --> 00:10:46.080
Nanny, and my brother...

00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.240
they all hate Japanese soldiers to death.

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:48.440
Everyone in the whole village is.

00:10:48.879 --> 00:10:49.840
My father won't help us.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.559
You have me.

00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:20.080
Sasaki

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:23.720
That's the situation regarding the missing sentry.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.440
I heard, I heard.

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.440
Listen carefully.

00:11:26.440 --> 00:11:27.679
Immediately organize the police brigade

00:11:27.679 --> 00:11:30.320
and the garrison for a full-island search.

00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.200
But Captain, you're still...

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:31.919
Don't worry about me.

00:11:31.919 --> 00:11:33.559
I can't leave right now.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.320
Right now, only you can handle this.

00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:38.320
Take some men separately.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.559
The main task is not to find

00:11:39.559 --> 00:11:41.639
that missing soldier.

00:11:41.639 --> 00:11:42.840
What's important is to use this chance

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:44.399
to go to Ye Degong's house again

00:11:44.399 --> 00:11:45.879
and uncover the secret of that wall for me.

00:11:46.279 --> 00:11:48.519
If you really find a secret room,

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.559
or

00:11:49.559 --> 00:11:50.799
capture that American who landed on the island,

00:11:50.799 --> 00:11:52.399
send someone to notify me immediately.

00:11:52.399 --> 00:11:53.000
Yes.

00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:00.440
Begin the operation.

00:12:00.799 --> 00:12:01.279
Yes.

00:12:01.279 --> 00:12:02.360
First squad, with me!

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.279
About face!

00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:04.360
Double time!

00:12:23.679 --> 00:12:25.840
Takeki also hadn't anticipated

00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:27.480
obtaining a lead on the American messenger

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:29.960
so quickly.

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.960
And right in his own assistant's home.

00:12:33.639 --> 00:12:35.320
But he also knew well

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.960
that getting the Ye father and son to hand over the messenger

00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:43.440
would not be so simple.

00:13:29.919 --> 00:13:30.279
Hey.

00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:31.840
Don't take your clothes off at my doorstep.

00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:42.320
Not allowed.

00:13:42.919 --> 00:13:43.440
Fine.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.360
Don't let him in.

00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:57.639
It's fine.

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.000
I brought him.

00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.120
He needs to talk to Dad.

00:14:01.879 --> 00:14:02.679
Mr. Ye, hello.

00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:04.279
Takeki Ichiro.

00:14:04.559 --> 00:14:06.200
A pleasure to meet you.

00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:07.480
Go.

00:14:09.759 --> 00:14:10.519
The sentry is dead.

00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:17.039
I'll visit another day.

00:14:19.240 --> 00:14:20.000
Go back to sleep.

00:14:20.759 --> 00:14:22.039
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:24.720
Drop your weapon.

00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:33.559
Get out.

00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:37.240
Elder Ye.

00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:37.759
Dad.

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:42.279
We have something we'd like to discuss with you.

00:14:43.879 --> 00:14:44.679
Elder Ye.

00:14:44.679 --> 00:14:45.919
Yesterday was rushed.

00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:46.639
Today,

00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:48.000
I am formally paying my respects

00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.320
to the father of my assistant, Ye Biying.

00:14:49.879 --> 00:14:50.840
My name is Takeki Ichiro,

00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.600
an investigator from the Imperial Household Agency.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.600
I have nothing to say to you.

00:14:58.600 --> 00:14:59.320
Go back.

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:08.799
Elder Ye.

00:15:09.519 --> 00:15:11.440
I need to have a formal conversation with you.

00:15:11.879 --> 00:15:13.200
I hope you will give me the chance

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:15.200
to speak with you properly today.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.480
We have nothing to discuss.

00:15:18.360 --> 00:15:20.240
Please stop pestering my daughter.

00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:22.240
Cats and mice don't share a bed.

00:15:22.240 --> 00:15:23.440
Tigers and deer don't walk together.

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.320
There is nothing to talk about between you and me.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.320
Dad, I...

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:32.879
Between Biying and me,

00:15:32.879 --> 00:15:33.879
it's not what you imagine.

00:15:34.679 --> 00:15:35.559
I also assure you

00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:36.840
I have never done

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:38.200
anything to harm Chinese people.

00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:40.440
I have nothing to say to Japanese people.

00:15:43.519 --> 00:15:44.759
I can swear to you,

00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:47.320
and I would certainly not harm your daughter.

00:15:48.120 --> 00:15:48.679
Please believe me.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.279
But right now, you stand

00:15:51.279 --> 00:15:51.879
in the role of an aggressor

00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:54.360
on invaded land.

00:15:56.519 --> 00:15:57.639
Did I let you in?

00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:01.799
Get out.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:06.279
That uniform of yours cannot convince me.

00:16:08.279 --> 00:16:09.039
Get out.

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:22.200
Colonel.

00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:24.759
What are you doing here?

00:16:26.879 --> 00:16:30.399
We are ordered to search this place.

00:16:35.679 --> 00:16:36.919
Ever since I first arrived on the island,

00:16:37.679 --> 00:16:39.279
Commander Fujita has expressed to me

00:16:39.279 --> 00:16:40.360
his respect for Elder Ye.

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:42.360
If you can find anyone here,

00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.279
I'll shoot his entire family for you.

00:16:44.279 --> 00:16:45.519
But if you search and find nothing,

00:16:45.519 --> 00:16:46.960
I'll put a bullet in you myself.

00:16:47.279 --> 00:16:49.519
Or you can explain it personally to Commander Fujita.

00:16:52.039 --> 00:16:53.080
Get out.

00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:53.799
Yes.

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.440
Dad.

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:06.599
I'm sorry, Elder Ye.

00:17:06.920 --> 00:17:08.000
For disturbing you.

00:17:09.119 --> 00:17:10.519
Thank you for your help.

00:17:11.319 --> 00:17:12.839
For sparing us from harassment.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:15.799
But,

00:17:17.119 --> 00:17:18.960
regarding my daughter, I think

00:17:19.599 --> 00:17:21.079
there's no need for further discussion.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:21.960
Dad.

00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:23.240
He's not here to discuss me.

00:17:23.559 --> 00:17:24.119
Don't be so stubborn.

00:17:24.119 --> 00:17:24.480
Elder Ye.

00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:25.759
This is a matter of great importance.

00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:27.640
I hope you will give me a chance.

00:17:28.359 --> 00:17:29.920
Xia'er, see our guest out.

00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:33.079
Dad.

00:17:33.079 --> 00:17:33.839
Elder Ye.

00:17:37.079 --> 00:17:38.119
Elder Ye.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:48.480
Takeki Ichiro will visit another day.

00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:49.839
Goodbye.

00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:15.079
This is my assistant's home.

00:18:15.519 --> 00:18:16.240
From today onward,

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.440
without my order,

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:19.000
no one is to disturb them.

00:18:19.119 --> 00:18:19.759
Is that understood?

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:21.720
This puts me in a difficult position.

00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:23.359
Unless your superior

00:18:23.720 --> 00:18:24.559
has his approval,

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:25.920
have him come speak to me directly.

00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.079
Yes.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.839
Didn't go well?

00:19:04.359 --> 00:19:05.519
But I still gained something.

00:19:06.279 --> 00:19:07.440
I can now be almost certain

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:09.119
your father is connected to that American.

00:19:09.359 --> 00:19:10.599
That goes without saying.

00:19:10.759 --> 00:19:11.240
But the key point is,

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.519
are they in danger or not?

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:17.319
Inoue is currently locked in the brig.

00:19:17.319 --> 00:19:19.000
So the American is safe for now.

00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:20.720
Tonight, Lieutenant General Fujita

00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:21.960
has prepared a welcome banquet for us.

00:19:22.359 --> 00:19:23.720
If we attend as scheduled,

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:25.039
and you perform well,

00:19:25.039 --> 00:19:26.160
if you can handle it smoothly,

00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:27.839
your family will be safe for the time being.

00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:35.279
Is this even reliable? Darn it.

00:19:35.519 --> 00:19:37.759
So, to make this more reliable,

00:19:37.759 --> 00:19:39.680
while there's still time before the banquet,

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.359
I'm going to give you special training.

00:19:42.839 --> 00:19:43.880
Special training.

00:19:44.319 --> 00:19:45.480
More training?

00:19:46.519 --> 00:19:47.359
You people from the Military Statistics Bureau,

00:19:47.359 --> 00:19:49.440
always cramming at the last minute, huh?

00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:50.000
No, no, no.

00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:51.680
It's just last-minute cramming.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:54.759
How did it go?

00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:56.200
The search failed.

00:19:56.759 --> 00:19:57.599
Why?

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.839
The Colonel wouldn't let me search.

00:20:00.079 --> 00:20:00.359
At the time,

00:20:00.359 --> 00:20:00.880
Colonel Takeki was talking with that old man.

00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:01.519
They were arguing fiercely.

00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:04.880
What were they talking about?

00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:05.880
I don't know either.

00:20:07.519 --> 00:20:08.599
I see.

00:20:08.799 --> 00:20:11.480
You probably interrupted

00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:14.119
a negotiation between a prospective son-in-law and father-in-law.

00:20:14.119 --> 00:20:16.160
It seems Colonel Takeki

00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.880
really takes this Chinese woman seriously.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.039
He also said...

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:19.920
Said what?

00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.680
If there is a genuine need to search the Ye family,

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.359
my superior must first negotiate with him.

00:20:26.839 --> 00:20:29.119
What did you say?

00:20:29.519 --> 00:20:30.640
That jerk!

00:21:02.720 --> 00:21:03.839
Salute!

00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.000
This Colonel, relying on

00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:06.960
his little status from the Imperial Palace,

00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.759
looks down on everyone on this island.

00:21:09.559 --> 00:21:12.240
Can we really not deal with him?

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:14.640
I'm curious what kind of person could make

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.839
Battalion Commander Inoue, who always angers others,

00:21:16.839 --> 00:21:18.480
this angry himself.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:37.119
Long time no see.

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.279
What are you up to?

00:21:41.079 --> 00:21:41.920
Carrying out a mission.

00:21:44.559 --> 00:21:46.559
My eyes...

00:21:58.359 --> 00:22:00.599
I've finally waited for your return.

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:04.720
Don't cross this line.

00:22:08.559 --> 00:22:09.279
You stink!

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:12.440
How many days since you last bathed?

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.440
Sorry.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.359
Just talk to me from over there.

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.680
A sentry went missing yesterday.

00:22:29.839 --> 00:22:31.359
But that missing American

00:22:31.359 --> 00:22:32.799
still hasn't been found.

00:22:33.559 --> 00:22:35.880
Many strange things have happened recently.

00:22:37.559 --> 00:22:38.960
The woman brought by this Colonel

00:22:39.359 --> 00:22:41.119
is highly suspicious.

00:22:42.039 --> 00:22:45.680
That strange Colonel and his strange woman...

00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:49.160
Are those people a threat to us or not?

00:22:49.160 --> 00:22:51.279
We need further verification.

00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:52.839
This arrogant fellow,

00:22:52.839 --> 00:22:54.279
what is his purpose for coming to the island?

00:22:55.759 --> 00:22:57.519
He even stopped

00:22:57.519 --> 00:22:59.640
Sasaki's search of the Ye family.

00:23:00.079 --> 00:23:00.680
Furthermore,

00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:01.759
as soon as the American plane crashed,

00:23:02.039 --> 00:23:04.599
the Colonel and his woman arrived on the island right after.

00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.960
As soon as they arrived, people started dying.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.720
It's all too coincidental.

00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:11.519
I probed him about the death of the hidden sentry.

00:23:11.519 --> 00:23:13.119
He truly has no motive for the murder.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:20.160
It could also have been done by people from Macau, China.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:21.039
Additionally,

00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:22.720
as soon as that woman landed,

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.640
she was interrogated by us.

00:23:25.079 --> 00:23:26.160
But she was taken away by the Colonel not long after.

00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:27.880
But she was taken away by the Colonel not long after.

00:23:32.559 --> 00:23:33.680
I get the gist of the situation.

00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.559
Yell a little louder!

00:23:42.880 --> 00:23:43.640
Best if the people outside

00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:44.880
all know you're in special training.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.200
Let me tell you,

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.599
I don't like you like this.

00:23:56.599 --> 00:23:58.640
I don't like you like this either.

00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:02.440
Don't let the act become real, okay?

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.599
We're acting.

00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:08.640
Then what kind do you like?

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.720
I like interesting ones.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:12.960
How interesting?

00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:13.799
More interesting than you.

00:24:14.519 --> 00:24:17.319
I actually thought just now was quite interesting.

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:19.160
Remember this.

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.599
As a dance hall girl,

00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:21.880
first,

00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.319
she's long been accustomed to physical contact.

00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:25.839
Tonight at the banquet,

00:24:26.119 --> 00:24:27.880
Japanese officers will surely invite you to dance.

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:30.359
If you treat them like you treat me,

00:24:30.359 --> 00:24:31.240
we're both done for.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:10.640
What are you doing?

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:11.119
What are you looking at?

00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.039
What's up there?

00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.319
Why do you keep looking up?

00:25:13.519 --> 00:25:14.599
Can't you look at me?

00:25:16.599 --> 00:25:17.359
Look at me.

00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:19.000
Look at me.

00:25:19.559 --> 00:25:19.920
Second,

00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:21.680
as a dance hall girl,

00:25:22.079 --> 00:25:23.559
her gaze never flinches.

00:25:24.279 --> 00:25:24.680
Look at me.

00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:28.440
Whether we pass tonight smoothly

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:29.119
doesn't depend on me.

00:25:29.640 --> 00:25:30.680
It depends on you.

00:25:58.359 --> 00:25:59.359
What are you doing?

00:25:59.599 --> 00:26:00.440
Third point.

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:01.559
Remember this.

00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:02.640
A dance hall girl

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.519
has a thousand ways to refuse a client,

00:26:04.759 --> 00:26:05.720
not by using this kind.

00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:07.880
If you do this tonight,

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:08.559
we'll also be finished.

00:26:10.839 --> 00:26:11.799
Mr. Takeki,

00:26:11.799 --> 00:26:14.200
your hand is in the wrong place.

00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:14.880
No good.

00:26:15.279 --> 00:26:16.480
Mr. Takeki,

00:26:17.119 --> 00:26:18.319
please be merciful.

00:26:19.319 --> 00:26:19.839
Not right either.

00:26:24.680 --> 00:26:25.680
Mr. Takeki,

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:30.240
why is your hand in more of a hurry than your heart?

00:26:33.759 --> 00:26:36.680
Hmm, that's getting somewhere.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.519
Remember,

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.039
it's best to always keep smiling.

00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:47.880
A smile is your best cover.

00:26:59.319 --> 00:27:00.359
Your profession

00:27:01.440 --> 00:27:04.440
is as a taxi dancer in a Shanghai dance hall.

00:27:04.599 --> 00:27:05.000
Is that so?

00:27:07.519 --> 00:27:08.680
In times like these,

00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:10.359
that's not a bad profession.

00:27:11.839 --> 00:27:14.480
You work at the Cathay Dance Hall on Edward VII Avenue

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.920
as a taxi dancer.

00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:18.599
I've been to that dance hall.

00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:20.240
The lighting is good.

00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:21.839
It's just that

00:27:21.839 --> 00:27:25.359
the marble dance floor is a bit too slippery.

00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.759
On Medhurst Road.

00:27:32.039 --> 00:27:35.759
The Cathay Dance Hall is on Medhurst Road,

00:27:37.039 --> 00:27:38.799
not where you said.

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.759
And also,

00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.160
it has a sprung dance floor,

00:27:45.559 --> 00:27:47.200
not marble.

00:28:10.359 --> 00:28:12.240
Our ideal launch zone

00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:14.200
is located 400 miles east of Dong Jing.

00:28:14.759 --> 00:28:16.079
I propose that on the 19th,

00:28:16.079 --> 00:28:18.799
one plane takes off three hours before dusk.

00:28:19.119 --> 00:28:20.920
The other planes take off at dusk.

00:28:21.519 --> 00:28:23.079
After flying for two hours,

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.440
we will drop bombs on Dong Jing at night.

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:28.440
Before the Japanese wake up,

00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:30.000
we'll already be on our way to China.

00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:31.759
By the early morning of the 20th,

00:28:31.759 --> 00:28:33.359
we will land at Quzhou Airport.

00:28:33.559 --> 00:28:34.839
After refueling,

00:28:34.839 --> 00:28:36.359
we will continue flying to

00:28:36.359 --> 00:28:37.680
Chongqing, China's wartime capital.

00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.599
I've heard many legends about you, Doolittle.

00:28:41.359 --> 00:28:42.640
Everyone here knows

00:28:42.640 --> 00:28:43.319
Pearl Harbor

00:28:43.319 --> 00:28:45.680
was the greatest humiliation of my life.

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.279
Nothing would make me happier

00:28:47.279 --> 00:28:48.880
than attacking those darn Japanese.

00:28:50.359 --> 00:28:52.720
But this is a crazy plan.

00:28:53.160 --> 00:28:57.599
The Navy and Army have never cooperated like this.

00:28:58.519 --> 00:28:59.440
General,

00:28:59.920 --> 00:29:01.279
we are indeed doing what others dare not think.

00:29:01.279 --> 00:29:03.160
We are doing what others dare not imagine.

00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:06.440
I still have my doubts.

00:29:07.359 --> 00:29:11.079
Sir, that's my purpose here today.

00:29:11.319 --> 00:29:11.960
To dispel the Navy's

00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:14.039
doubts about our Army pilots' capabilities.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:18.039
Listen up, Jimmy.

00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:21.920
If your test flight succeeds today,

00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:24.240
within three days,

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.839
you load your planes onto the "Hornet".

00:29:27.039 --> 00:29:27.519
Then,

00:29:28.319 --> 00:29:30.440
on the morning of April 2nd,

00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.599
led by Captain Mitchell,

00:29:32.599 --> 00:29:34.279
the Hornet and Task Force 18

00:29:34.279 --> 00:29:35.559
will depart from Alameda.

00:29:36.559 --> 00:29:38.880
I will be on the Enterprise near Midway

00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:40.920
to rendezvous with you.

00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:42.440
Then, under my command,

00:29:42.799 --> 00:29:47.279
we merge into Task Force 16.

00:29:47.759 --> 00:29:49.000
Task Force 16

00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:50.839
includes the Hornet and the Enterprise,

00:29:50.839 --> 00:29:53.359
four cruisers, eight destroyers,

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:56.200
two submarines, and two oilers.

00:29:56.799 --> 00:30:00.440
It will take us 18 days to cross the Pacific.

00:30:00.839 --> 00:30:06.359
When we reach 400 nautical miles east of Japan,

00:30:06.359 --> 00:30:09.039
your B-25 bombers will take off.

00:30:09.799 --> 00:30:11.680
Once airborne,

00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.279
the task force will turn back to Hawaii.

00:30:14.279 --> 00:30:15.880
Then you're on your own.

00:30:18.079 --> 00:30:19.440
Sir, we are always ready.

00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:21.519
Let me emphasize one more point.

00:30:22.319 --> 00:30:23.519
This combined fleet

00:30:23.519 --> 00:30:26.680
is all the naval power left after Pearl Harbor.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:28.279
If we are discovered

00:30:28.279 --> 00:30:29.599
before reaching the launch point,

00:30:29.599 --> 00:30:31.559
the bombers will have to launch early,

00:30:31.559 --> 00:30:33.200
to Midway or Dong Jing.

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:35.000
This way, the Hornet's deck

00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.279
can be cleared for fighter planes

00:30:36.279 --> 00:30:39.279
My primary mission is to protect the ships.

00:30:40.119 --> 00:30:40.839
Understood, sir.

00:30:41.119 --> 00:30:42.200
One last thing.

00:30:43.319 --> 00:30:45.880
We will not have lights on at night.

00:30:47.599 --> 00:30:49.079
The deck will be pitch black.

00:30:49.079 --> 00:30:50.720
Take off after sunset.

00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:53.039
Sir, we are proceeding with the launch test.

00:30:53.039 --> 00:30:54.480
Sir, we are proceeding with the launch test.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:55.640
Jimmy, are you ready?

00:30:56.599 --> 00:30:57.200
Yes, sir.

00:30:59.039 --> 00:31:00.440
I'm excited

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:01.039
to see

00:31:01.039 --> 00:31:03.079
what you can do with that big bird.

00:31:03.559 --> 00:31:04.160
Jimmy,

00:31:05.039 --> 00:31:07.480
our mission depends on

00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:09.319
your success today.

00:31:09.319 --> 00:31:11.759
I certainly don't want to see you fail.

00:32:04.920 --> 00:32:06.079
The plane is on the deck.

00:32:06.079 --> 00:32:06.759
General,

00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:09.119
let's see what happens.

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:25.079
7701 ready.

00:32:25.839 --> 00:32:27.960
7701 cleared for takeoff.

00:32:28.279 --> 00:32:29.200
Roger.

00:32:33.039 --> 00:32:33.880
Lieutenant Cole,

00:32:34.839 --> 00:32:36.720
time to show your training results.

00:32:37.119 --> 00:32:37.599
Yes, sir.

00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:39.440
Flaps down.

00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:41.599
Full throttle.

00:32:44.519 --> 00:32:46.599
Tower to 7701.

00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:48.039
Go ahead.

00:32:48.559 --> 00:32:49.759
Prepare for takeoff.

00:32:50.599 --> 00:32:51.240
Copy.

00:32:51.359 --> 00:32:54.519
Ready, 7701 requesting takeoff.

00:32:55.759 --> 00:32:57.119
Cleared for takeoff. Good luck.

00:33:11.079 --> 00:33:11.279
Sir,

00:33:11.279 --> 00:33:12.200
we left at least

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.119
30 yards of deck unused.

00:33:13.119 --> 00:33:14.039
Unbelievable.

00:33:25.559 --> 00:33:26.880
Jimmy, congratulations.

00:33:27.559 --> 00:33:30.160
From now on, my fleet fully supports you.

00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:34.440
Thank you, General.

00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:36.680
Lieutenant Cole,

00:33:37.680 --> 00:33:38.440
take the plane back.

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:39.559
Yes, sir.

00:33:57.359 --> 00:33:58.119
Arnold here.

00:33:58.839 --> 00:33:59.799
Hap, it's George Marshall.

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:00.960
I just saw the footage of the B-25

00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.480
taking off from the Hornet.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.079
Doolittle did a great job.

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:06.480
I've always had faith, George.

00:34:06.759 --> 00:34:08.480
Has the President seen the footage?

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:11.480
He has, and he's very pleased.

00:34:11.679 --> 00:34:13.239
He just gave the final approval.

00:34:13.239 --> 00:34:15.000
Hap, any more questions?

00:34:17.079 --> 00:34:17.760
No.

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.239
Doolittle is the best.

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:22.199
Even though I don't want him to risk it,

00:34:23.079 --> 00:34:25.039
I believe he can complete the mission.

00:34:26.239 --> 00:34:27.719
Yes. Talk later.

00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.719
I will impress you.

00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:04.039
Looks good.

00:35:07.599 --> 00:35:10.280
Why does the Commandant

00:35:10.320 --> 00:35:13.599
always host this kind of Western banquet?

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:14.679
Perhaps the Commandant

00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:16.920
likes this Western banquet style.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:18.119
I see.

00:35:18.320 --> 00:35:19.239
Country bumpkins.

00:35:20.199 --> 00:35:21.800
When the Commandant was at the New York consulate,

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.440
he attended these kinds of parties.

00:35:23.639 --> 00:35:25.119
He ate this kind of food.

00:35:32.679 --> 00:35:34.519
Colonel, the Commandant is waiting for you.

00:35:45.920 --> 00:35:46.559
Colonel.

00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:47.920
Miss Ye.

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:50.199
Interpreter Luo.

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:51.559
Please wait a moment.

00:35:51.559 --> 00:35:52.920
I'll go ask the Commandant to come down.

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:54.599
Thank you for your trouble.

00:36:00.159 --> 00:36:00.760
What are you looking at?

00:36:02.199 --> 00:36:04.480
This is where I grew up.

00:36:05.119 --> 00:36:06.519
I know it all too well.

00:36:08.039 --> 00:36:09.360
The moment I stepped in,

00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:13.119
I felt the anger of my home being invaded.

00:36:15.079 --> 00:36:16.199
It's like my shoes

00:36:17.159 --> 00:36:18.199
are covered in dirt,

00:36:18.239 --> 00:36:19.440
not knowing where to step.

00:36:20.159 --> 00:36:21.920
I really want to set a fire,

00:36:22.119 --> 00:36:23.039
and burn this place down.

00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.559
Control your inner emotions.

00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.840
Only then can you drive out

00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:29.760
all that filth from your home.

00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.639
Since childhood, there have been countless banquets here.

00:36:34.639 --> 00:36:35.840
I never imagined

00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:39.079
that I would be wearing this outfit

00:36:39.719 --> 00:36:40.880
and coming to my own home

00:36:41.519 --> 00:36:43.199
to attend a Japanese banquet.

00:36:45.559 --> 00:36:46.320
Control yourself.

00:36:52.719 --> 00:36:56.920
How timely, our protagonist has arrived.

00:36:57.559 --> 00:36:58.119
Yes.

00:37:06.239 --> 00:37:07.920
Is that Miss Ye?

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:09.519
Commander.

00:37:10.159 --> 00:37:11.519
This is Miss Ye Biying.

00:37:13.599 --> 00:37:14.360
Miss Ye.

00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.039
I am Commander Fujita.

00:37:17.519 --> 00:37:19.960
Your father and I are friends.

00:37:24.519 --> 00:37:26.079
She is indeed beautiful.

00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.559
The Colonel has good taste.

00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.719
Your father and I are old friends.

00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:37.519
Although we differ in our views on the current situation,

00:37:37.599 --> 00:37:39.280
our hobbies are the same.

00:37:39.679 --> 00:37:41.079
Tea ceremony, history. I still respect him greatly.

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.920
We both served as diplomats.

00:37:44.199 --> 00:37:46.079
Your father was my senior.

00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:49.079
He was the one who let me live in this place.

00:37:49.559 --> 00:37:50.920
I am very grateful.

00:37:52.159 --> 00:37:53.079
I presume, Miss Ye,

00:37:53.559 --> 00:37:55.519
you are also very familiar with this place.

00:37:56.440 --> 00:37:58.840
You can make yourself at home.

00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:07.760
Let me introduce everyone.

00:38:09.159 --> 00:38:14.960
This is the Emperor's special envoy,

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:17.480
Colonel Takeki Ichiro.

00:38:17.760 --> 00:38:18.760
Yes.

00:38:19.239 --> 00:38:21.000
The Colonel is here

00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.440
to carry out a very important mission.

00:38:23.639 --> 00:38:27.440
If the Colonel requires cooperation from the unit commanders,

00:38:27.840 --> 00:38:28.519
you must provide your full support. Understood?

00:38:28.760 --> 00:38:29.559
Yes.

00:38:31.559 --> 00:38:33.079
Let me introduce them to you.

00:42:23.039 --> 00:42:24.440
Hey! What are you doing?

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:26.679
Wait a moment.
