00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.440
(Episode 16)

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:08.310
Maybe it's my age,
but I keep getting lost in old memories.

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:11.280
I'm even starting to like oldies
and pop songs from back in the day.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.320
Hwa Young, don't be silly.
You're not getting old.

00:00:15.520 --> 00:00:19.260
You're still the same cover girl
from our school days.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:25.600
Going up.

00:00:25.600 --> 00:00:28.330
(That Night of Music and Memories)

00:00:28.530 --> 00:00:31.000
(We invite you back to the good old days.)

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:35.040
Whether you know my heart
or just pretend not to

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.910
Time just keeps on slipping by

00:00:39.310 --> 00:00:42.550
Even when you brush right past me

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.250
And turn away, pretending not to see

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.950
My heart flows on like a river

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.330
- Are you a rainbow drifting away?
- What do you think? Fun, right?

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.430
I would run to you

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.530
I would soar through the sky

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.100
Dad, I'm going to run to the restroom
before Tae Pyung starts singing.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:04.540
- Okay.
- If you'd come

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.140
Into my heart

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:13.010
Gosh, I can't believe
a place like this exists.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.880
For once, he didn't get scammed.

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:20.350
I'm just so glad
he can sing his heart out here.

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.720
Are you okay?

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.360
That weak ankle of yours...

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.500
- You're not seriously hurt, are you?
- No, I'm fine.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.700
- Here, let me at least take your bag.
- Look at those two lovebirds.

00:01:36.870 --> 00:01:37.870
What?

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.170
- Shall we?
- Okay.

00:01:44.310 --> 00:01:47.180
I've been looking all over for you.
Where'd you run off to?

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:50.520
What are you talking about?
Can't I even use the restroom?

00:01:50.750 --> 00:01:53.280
I was just in the restroom. What is it?

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:55.950
- It's an emergency. Hurry, come with me.
- What?

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.730
For countless days

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:11.440
Though I tried with all my might

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:15.010
Nothing seemed to get any better

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.450
You hide your heart
afraid I might find out

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:28.690
All the many casual goodbyes around me

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.520
- Hey, Jang Mi!
- Tae Pyung! I heard your clothes ripped.

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:36.590
How did that happen?

00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:38.330
This is a disaster.
You have to fix it, quick.

00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.400
He was practicing his dance moves
and the seam just completely split open.

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:43.300
I'm on soon. What am I going to do?

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:45.640
I can't go on for my debut stage
in just a dress shirt.

00:02:45.700 --> 00:02:48.310
We're short on time,

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.670
but don't worry.

00:03:08.590 --> 00:03:11.200
Gosh, you've got everything in there.

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.400
So that's why
Tae Pyung told me to get you.

00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.140
Turn around.

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.670
Gosh, be careful.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:26.140
You're so high-maintenance.
What would you have done without this?

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.450
You're so glad I'm here, aren't you?

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:31.020
Hey, hold still. All done. There.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:33.020
We're out of time.

00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.490
All of my days

00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:53.670
Jang Mi said she went to the restroom.
Where did she go?

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.870
Tae Pyung should be on any minute now.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.080
Tae Pyung's coming on. Jang Mi...

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:05.020
Jang Mi's gone. What? My Jang Mi is gone.

00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:08.050
- Jang Mi!
- It's okay, Suk Hee. She will be back.

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.290
It's okay. Where is she?
What's taking her so long?

00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.830
- What is it? Do you know them?
- No.

00:04:21.130 --> 00:04:23.030
I'm just surprised to see
the owner of the side dish shop here.

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:25.900
So, what do you think, Professor?

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:29.040
It's a nice change of pace coming here,
isn't it?

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:31.740
Yes, it's wonderful.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.610
Actually, I...

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.080
Actually?

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:39.520
As long as I'm with you, Hwa Young,

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:41.590
I'd be happy anywhere.

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:43.760
You're such a flatterer.

00:04:44.890 --> 00:04:46.160
What? Isn't that...

00:04:46.390 --> 00:04:47.390
Jang Mi's gone.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:51.560
Suk Hee, it's okay.
Let's sit and wait for Jang Mi, all right?

00:04:51.730 --> 00:04:53.400
Yes, it's okay. There, there.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.570
Here, have some of this.

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.940
Let's have a snack while we wait.

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:02.070
Jang Mi's gone. Jang Mi!

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:03.570
- Jang Mi!
- Suk Hee!

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.110
Suk Hee!

00:05:05.110 --> 00:05:06.980
- Jang Mi!
- Suk Hee!

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.880
Tonight, performing at our bar...

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:12.150
is a hot new singer.

00:05:12.980 --> 00:05:16.420
Please welcome Tae Pyung! Come on out!

00:05:16.490 --> 00:05:19.390
Tae Pyung!

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.600
Hello, everyone!
The greatest ocean is the Pacific.

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:29.600
The greatest singer is Oh Tae Pyung.
And that's me!

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:45.420
Let's have a drink

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.650
Let's party until we drop,
let's have a drink

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:52.060
Tonight, you and I

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:55.490
We'll become one and go

00:05:55.590 --> 00:05:58.400
Let's have a drink

00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:03.100
Let's party until we drop,
let's have a drink

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.740
Look. The CEO of Dream Hotel is here.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:06.470
What? Where?

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.340
Over there. That glamorous woman.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:18.650
- Dad?
- What?

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:24.520
- It's nothing.
- A drink for a hangover, and for thirst

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.690
Because it's Friday night

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:30.130
Oh, Dad.

00:06:31.230 --> 00:06:32.230
Hey, Dad.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:36.930
What? What about Mom?

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.340
Suk Hee.

00:06:42.470 --> 00:06:44.740
Suk Hee. Oh, Suk Hee.

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.380
Mom!

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:49.280
Look, Jang Mi's here. It's Jang Mi.

00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.280
Jang Mi!

00:06:54.090 --> 00:06:56.650
I was so scared. I thought you were gone.

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.020
It's okay, all right? It's okay.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:02.530
She made a huge scene
crying that you’d disappeared.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:03.560
I really got an earful.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:05.060
Suk Hee.

00:07:05.660 --> 00:07:06.860
You're happy to see Jang Mi, aren't you?

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.100
Yes, I'm so happy. Jang Mi's here.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:13.840
I'm so sorry, Mom.

00:07:14.270 --> 00:07:17.880
I said I was just going to the restroom.
You must've been so worried I wasn't back.

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:19.410
I'm so sorry, okay?

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:20.950
I'm sorry.

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:23.750
I'm so sorry, Mom, okay?

00:07:26.650 --> 00:07:29.520
Why are you crying?
I would never leave you.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.290
It's okay.

00:07:48.910 --> 00:07:51.940
Ma'am! Did your husband beat you up again?

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.380
Oh, my gosh.

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.780
Why do you put up with that?

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:57.720
Some people just live
because they can't die.

00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:02.620
Stay out of sight when your face is messy.
It's unpleasant for us.

00:08:02.690 --> 00:08:03.690
Yes, ma'am.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.330
Grandpa! Don't I get any praise?

00:08:09.730 --> 00:08:12.700
Look at you. What's gotten into you today?
Waking up so early...

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.100
to have breakfast and tea
with your old grandpa.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.140
I suppose she's finally realizing
how important her company position is.

00:08:19.300 --> 00:08:20.300
You think so?

00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:25.040
By the way,
clear your schedule this afternoon.

00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.450
- You too, Seo Rin.
- Why, Grandpa?

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:31.620
What do you mean why?
At your hotel restaurant,

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.280
I was just thinking
we'd have a meal together.

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:37.960
Grandpa, does this mean you're finally
going to let me date Chef Kang Jun Ho?

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:39.460
Don't get ahead of yourself, Ma Seo Rin.

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:46.060
Oh, for crying out loud.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:48.430
I don't have a single decent tie.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:54.270
You've never worn a tie in your life.
Why the sudden search for one?

00:08:55.970 --> 00:08:59.110
Come to think of it, you've put
a lot of effort into your looks.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:03.110
When you get older, you have to polish up
and look sharp.

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:05.780
That's how you earn respect
wherever you go.

00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.490
Imagine being old and dressing sloppily.
How do you think people would treat you?

00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.920
It would all reflect badly on you.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:18.230
Do people still blame the wife
for her husband's terrible fashion sense?

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.900
I agree with you,

00:09:21.570 --> 00:09:23.830
but the problem is
that's not how other people see it.

00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:26.940
Since when have you ever cared
what other people think?

00:09:28.010 --> 00:09:30.710
Coming from the man wearing ratty T-shirts
and socks with holes?

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:33.880
I've decided to
turn over a new leaf, okay?

00:09:35.150 --> 00:09:38.050
You should go to the hair salon
once in a while too.

00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:42.790
- Okay?
- All right, I get it.

00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.520
- Baek Ho, let's go.
- Okay, Mom.

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:49.530
I need to talk to Dad about something.
You can head to work first, Mom.

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:51.360
You do?

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.200
So, a little father-son date, is it?

00:09:55.770 --> 00:09:58.600
Okay. I'll get out of your hair. I'm off!

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.110
Okay.

00:10:06.180 --> 00:10:07.510
So, what's up?

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:08.850
What do you think?

00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:12.620
I'd like an explanation for why you were
with CEO Chae yesterday.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:17.020
- What?
- At the lounge bar yesterday.

00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.920
I saw you sitting there all cozy
with CEO Chae.

00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.100
Oh, that?

00:10:29.670 --> 00:10:32.370
Kid, it was just networking.
Strictly business.

00:10:33.870 --> 00:10:35.710
What's with that look?

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:38.110
What, do you just go around
suspecting everyone?

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.810
If you see a man and a woman together,
you just assume the worst?

00:10:41.550 --> 00:10:43.010
Me? Suspect you?

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:47.450
Come on. A dad who only has eyes for Mom
isn't going to have a wandering eye.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:50.760
Then that's settled, son.

00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:53.320
And here I was thinking
it was something serious.

00:10:57.130 --> 00:10:59.860
I was there on business for Dream Hotel,

00:10:59.930 --> 00:11:02.970
and I just happened to run into CEO Chae
on her way out.

00:11:03.430 --> 00:11:08.310
She was invited by a singer she sponsors.
She was on her way there.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.910
She suggested we talk business on the way,
so I just tagged along.

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:13.340
I see.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:16.410
I can't believe you're grilling me
about this.

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.780
Wait, why am I even explaining myself
to you?

00:11:21.150 --> 00:11:23.920
Anyway, how did you end up there?

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:27.860
That singer CEO Chae sponsors
is a close friend of mine.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:33.100
- Look at the time. I have to go.
- Okay.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.530
Have a good day.
I'm heading out in a bit myself.

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:42.940
That kid.

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.580
When could he have possibly seen that?

00:11:46.010 --> 00:11:47.910
That was delicious. Thank you.

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.270
Was the sea bream steak to your liking?

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.700
I made sure to prepare a dish
that's easy to digest.

00:12:12.500 --> 00:12:16.210
- Yes.
- The lemon butter sauce was great.

00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:19.210
And the black sesame panna cotta
was exceptional.

00:12:19.540 --> 00:12:20.540
Right, Grandpa?

00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.080
- I can speak for myself.
- I also thought...

00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:28.790
Why waste your breath? I can tell
what you're thinking from your expression.

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:31.560
Does she want the rest of us
to just shut it?

00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:35.930
Come to think of it, Seo Rin takes after
her mother, Chae Hwa Young.

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:41.400
Then, for a relaxing finish,
we'll serve a tea pairing.

00:12:41.530 --> 00:12:44.100
No, that's all right.
We can have tea at home.

00:12:44.870 --> 00:12:46.340
Very well, Chairman.

00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:53.140
He's always so cool.

00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:54.950
Right, Grandpa?

00:12:57.080 --> 00:12:58.950
Sitting here like this...

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:01.650
feels like a pre-wedding family meeting.
Right, Mom?

00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.390
- It does, doesn't it?
- A pre-wedding meeting?

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:07.360
Seo Rin. Watch your mouth.

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:11.500
- How can you say something so ridiculous?
- It's not ridiculous at all.

00:13:11.800 --> 00:13:13.130
Seo Rin has a point.

00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:14.500
Pardon?

00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:17.070
It's not as if you and Mrs. Yeom
are strangers.

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:19.870
Why get so worked up about it?

00:13:21.110 --> 00:13:23.070
Exactly.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.780
That's exactly why
I arranged this meeting.

00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:31.620
Yes, but I was going to make up
with San Wol on my own.

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:34.350
You didn't have to go
to all this trouble, Father.

00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:37.050
And to call in Assistant Manager Jin,
who'd already resigned,

00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:39.820
- I was wondering what this was all about.
- Well,

00:13:40.390 --> 00:13:43.560
it's not a matter that requires
your permission,

00:13:44.330 --> 00:13:46.100
but since we all live together,

00:13:47.400 --> 00:13:50.230
I have something of a major announcement
to make.

00:13:51.140 --> 00:13:53.400
That's also part of why we're here.

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:56.140
Don't tell me...

00:13:57.610 --> 00:13:58.610
That's right.

00:13:58.880 --> 00:14:00.110
I've decided to spend...

00:14:00.710 --> 00:14:03.050
the rest of my life with Mrs. Yeom.

00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.180
- Father!
- Oh, my goodness, Chairman.

00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.190
You didn't say a word to me about this.

00:14:08.450 --> 00:14:11.090
How could you spring such
a big announcement like this on me?

00:14:11.260 --> 00:14:12.920
What's wrong? You don't like the idea?

00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:15.190
Do I not like the idea? Don't be silly.

00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:19.960
I was just so surprised.
It was all so sudden.

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.000
I don't like it, Grandpa.
I'm completely against it.

00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:27.540
- Seo Rin.
- Grandpa. No, Chairman.

00:14:28.410 --> 00:14:32.210
Assistant Manager Jin was my errand girl,
practically my servant.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:33.610
And her mother is no different.

00:14:33.880 --> 00:14:35.750
I don't care if they say everyone's equal.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.380
For someone
as distinguished as you, Grandpa,

00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:39.120
to even consider living with
a woman like her...

00:14:39.820 --> 00:14:42.520
- is something I will never accept.
- Seo Rin.

00:14:42.690 --> 00:14:45.860
Ma Seo Rin.
You'd better shut it and not ruin this.

00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.290
That little brat.

00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:49.560
She's trying to ruin everything
right at the finish line.

00:14:49.990 --> 00:14:52.130
Her mother's antics weren't enough,
and now this one pipes up.

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:54.430
Just goes to show,
like mother, like daughter.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.570
I'm dead set against this, Grandpa.

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:01.070
I don't care if you date this woman
outside the house, Grandpa,

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:03.810
but I will fight you tooth and nail
if you bring her into our home.

00:15:04.310 --> 00:15:08.050
And if you insist
on marrying this woman anyway,

00:15:08.910 --> 00:15:10.680
I'll run away from home
and just kill myself.

00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:13.020
You know I do what I say
I'm going to do, right?

00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:16.250
I don't care about living anyway.

00:15:22.530 --> 00:15:23.530
Seo Rin.

00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:25.360
Seo Rin!

00:15:35.970 --> 00:15:39.810
- I'm home.
- Welcome back. How were the lunch boxes?

00:15:40.010 --> 00:15:44.050
They were a big hit. We should make flyers
for the side dishes and pass them out.

00:15:44.750 --> 00:15:46.050
That's a relief.

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:49.350
- Baek Ho is waiting for you, Jang Mi.
- What?

00:15:49.350 --> 00:15:52.460
He said he has something to tell you.
Why don't you go on in?

00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:53.560
Something to tell me?

00:15:57.860 --> 00:16:00.760
A singer's most important asset
is their voice.

00:16:01.270 --> 00:16:03.200
Hey, drink this Ssanghwa Tea.
It's good for your throat.

00:16:03.500 --> 00:16:04.500
Here you go.

00:16:06.040 --> 00:16:09.640
It feels like just yesterday
Dad was scolding me for sneaking eggs.

00:16:09.740 --> 00:16:12.140
- Now you're giving me a special treat?
- Hey, come on.

00:16:12.710 --> 00:16:16.510
Why are your ambitions as small
as this cup, Oh Tae Pyung?

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:18.880
To me, you're a legend, a superstar.

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:21.290
You're destined for greatness.
You can't be calling this a luxury.

00:16:21.350 --> 00:16:23.120
Okay, I get it, my friend.

00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:25.460
You asked to see me?

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.890
I have something to discuss with you.
Please have a seat.

00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:32.100
You sound like you own the place.

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:36.270
Tae Pyung. Hey, Oh Tae Pyung.
Come out here a minute.

00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:38.170
Yes? What for?

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:40.370
I said, get out here.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.010
What in the world does he want?

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:50.110
I've been thinking...

00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:51.750
Thinking about what?

00:16:54.390 --> 00:16:57.890
- Hey, kid. Learn to read the room.
- Why?

00:16:57.890 --> 00:17:01.430
You have to give them space to hit it off!
That's how people get married.

00:17:02.390 --> 00:17:03.960
You're unbelievable.

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:07.600
You went ballistic
when Tae Sook said she's getting married.

00:17:08.430 --> 00:17:12.100
So you want me to file a public petition
to install a CCTV camera near the banner?

00:17:12.170 --> 00:17:15.270
But installing a hidden camera
wouldn't be admissible in court,

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:18.040
- and we could even get countersued.
- Countersued?

00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:21.580
People are sensitive to invasion
of privacy and defamation these days.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:25.450
- So we should do nothing out of fear?
- That's not it.

00:17:25.980 --> 00:17:28.790
My point is we do this by the book
and catch the culprit.

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:32.590
We put that banner up legitimately,
after all.

00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:34.730
The illegal part is
that they took it down without permission.

00:17:35.390 --> 00:17:39.600
Exactly. Who do they think they are,
taking down our banner?

00:17:40.060 --> 00:17:43.600
My point exactly. So we can ask them
to patrol the area more frequently...

00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:46.870
- and see if we can catch the culprit.
- Well, no time like the present.

00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.610
It's not like we're the ones
who did something wrong.

00:17:49.870 --> 00:17:51.340
So there's no reason
for us to break the law.

00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:56.150
Hello.

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:59.680
Yes, I just put the banner back up
and filed the report...

00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:01.990
What?

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:04.660
You're saying I'm not allowed
to hang the banner?

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:11.060
Thank you, sir.
I appreciate you handling that so quickly.

00:18:11.530 --> 00:18:12.660
Just tell me why.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.400
Why did you want me
to ban banners in that area?

00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.070
They're an eyesore.

00:18:17.370 --> 00:18:19.900
Plastered all over the place like that?
They bring down property values.

00:18:21.640 --> 00:18:23.440
All right, I won't ask any more questions.

00:18:24.040 --> 00:18:26.580
Thank you, sir. I'll come see you soon.

00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:30.950
Really?

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:33.520
A "big shot" with some pull in Taean?

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.120
Yes. He pulled some strings for me...

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:38.160
and made it so no banners
can be put up whatsoever.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.720
Good work.

00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:43.890
Is something wrong?

00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.100
The old man has made a mess of things.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.700
And because of it,
Seo Rin has declared she's moving out.

00:19:07.620 --> 00:19:08.620
All right.

00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.120
If that's really how you all feel,

00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:15.960
then I'll reconsider
keeping Mrs. Yeom by my side.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:17.590
Do you really mean that, Grandpa?

00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:19.000
I do, you little rascal.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.370
How am I supposed to date anyone
when you're so terrifying?

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:26.140
Thank you, Grandpa.

00:19:26.670 --> 00:19:29.710
My grandpa's the best.
This is exactly why I love you!

00:19:30.640 --> 00:19:34.080
Father.
Thank you for listening to our concerns.

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:37.310
You little rascal, I can't breathe.

00:19:38.850 --> 00:19:42.690
Grandpa, you want to play a game of Go?

00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:53.330
The nerve of that woman!
There's a limit to how you treat people.

00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:55.200
I'm so upset, really.

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:59.800
Mom, there's no need to be upset.
Have faith in the Chairman.

00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:01.440
You saw it yourself.

00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:04.780
He just went scrambling after that brat...

00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:08.450
- and told us to just go home.
- Wasn't this to be expected?

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:12.380
Did you think CEO Chae would roll over
and let us into their house?

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:15.190
Then how long are we supposed to play
this tug-of-war?

00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:17.750
I'm just so tired of it all.

00:20:19.590 --> 00:20:20.960
These things take time.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:24.560
It's about getting
into Chairman Ma's home.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:25.800
It's a huge deal.

00:20:26.530 --> 00:20:29.870
It'd be strange to get in right away,
don't you think?

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:30.900
You're right.

00:20:31.470 --> 00:20:34.400
We've been patient this long.
What's a little more waiting?

00:20:35.140 --> 00:20:38.880
No matter what happens,
we are moving into that house, Hong Ju.

00:20:39.740 --> 00:20:40.780
Just wait and see.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.250
Gosh, seriously.

00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:49.890
So you're saying they took down
every single banner in the area?

00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:55.090
- This is definitely...
- Someone must be pulling the strings.

00:20:55.460 --> 00:20:56.830
I was thinking the same thing.

00:20:57.290 --> 00:21:01.000
There has to be someone higher up
with pull to control the county office.

00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:10.840
So the people who did this to Suk Hee
are powerful.

00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:14.650
At least we've figured
that much out, right?

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:17.580
I guess it's not a total dead end, then.

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:45.040
Professor, is this a good time?

00:22:18.610 --> 00:22:20.940
- I didn't wake you, did I?
- Not at all, Hwa Young.

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:24.480
I can't believe you called me first.

00:22:25.250 --> 00:22:26.780
I'm wide awake now.

00:22:30.390 --> 00:22:33.020
I know it's late.
Is it a bad time to talk?

00:22:33.290 --> 00:22:36.660
Not at all.
Just getting to hear your voice...

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:39.330
- is wonderful.
- Me too.

00:22:40.930 --> 00:22:43.600
I couldn't sleep because I wanted to hear
your voice, Professor Kang.

00:22:45.770 --> 00:22:47.900
I miss you, Hwa Young.

00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:49.840
Me too.

00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:52.240
When should we get together?

00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:30.850
(Dream Hotel)

00:23:30.910 --> 00:23:32.220
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.680
What about that thing
I asked you to check?

00:23:33.880 --> 00:23:36.690
There's been no movement
from Yeom San Wol or Jin Hong Ju.

00:23:37.220 --> 00:23:38.220
Really?

00:23:39.060 --> 00:23:40.120
That's strange.

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:47.560
The Chairman wants to see you
and Director Ma in his study.

00:23:48.030 --> 00:23:49.100
With Seo Rin?

00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:01.180
Why does he want to see us in his study
during work hours?

00:24:01.880 --> 00:24:04.080
He's ready to train you as his successor.

00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:06.680
So don't mess around
in front of the directors.

00:24:07.050 --> 00:24:08.920
Show them what you're really made of.

00:24:10.990 --> 00:24:13.220
So you want me to put on an act
and be a good little girl?

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:18.360
I'm not kidding. Take this seriously.

00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.270
What's gotten into you?

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:26.770
Just listen to your mother.

00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:38.650
My sweet Seo Rin. This is your lucky mole.

00:25:15.050 --> 00:25:18.320
- Don't just stand there. Have a seat.
- Grandpa!

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.390
What is she doing here?

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:22.090
She quit, didn't she?

00:25:23.090 --> 00:25:24.530
I'm sure she's just here
to say her goodbyes.

00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:26.400
Isn't that right?

00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.500
Allow me to introduce myself.

00:25:32.770 --> 00:25:36.110
I just joined the Corporate Strategy Team
at Dream Group headquarters.

00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:39.510
- I'm Jin Hong Ju.
- What?

00:25:40.210 --> 00:25:41.810
- Father!
- Grandpa!

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:46.150
Since you said Dream Hotel has no use
for Assistant Manager Jin,

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:48.180
I had no choice but to bring her
to headquarters myself.

00:25:48.250 --> 00:25:50.420
Are you saying you're going to keep her
by your side, Chairman?

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:55.760
What would I do with an employee
who's only studied hotel management?

00:25:56.190 --> 00:25:59.930
The plan is to assign her to the hotel,
but as an employee of headquarters.

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:01.300
What did you say?

00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:07.340
Assistant Manager Jin, Director Ma,
please step outside.

00:26:22.950 --> 00:26:25.420
So you're saying Assistant Manager Jin
won't be an employee of Dream Hotel,

00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:29.330
but she'll work there
under the main office's authority?

00:26:30.230 --> 00:26:32.260
And is there a problem with that?

00:26:32.530 --> 00:26:35.400
I'm the one who transferred her to India.

00:26:36.430 --> 00:26:39.100
But she resigned because
she didn't want to go, didn't she?

00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:42.670
You should have accepted her resignation.
Instead, you call her back,

00:26:42.910 --> 00:26:45.580
just to shove her in my face
at my own hotel?

00:26:45.810 --> 00:26:47.780
- You're the one who started this.
- Father!

00:26:47.780 --> 00:26:49.010
Don't you raise your voice at me!

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:52.550
- You're the one who defied me!
- Right, Chairman.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:57.120
Business is business, and family matters
should be handled at home.

00:26:59.920 --> 00:27:02.460
Are you saying I can't separate business
from my personal life?

00:27:02.530 --> 00:27:04.390
I'm asking you to make that distinction.

00:27:05.260 --> 00:27:07.800
I can understand your feelings
about Yeom San Wol,

00:27:08.260 --> 00:27:12.270
but letting feelings affect the company
isn't like you, Chairman.

00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:16.570
I guess I'm just getting old.

00:27:17.070 --> 00:27:18.110
What can I do?

00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:21.080
Just like how I want to give
our dear Seo Rin a nice position,

00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.210
I can't help but feel the same way
toward Jin Hong Ju.

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:37.790
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:43.870
That crafty old fox.
How dare he undermine me like that?

00:27:45.770 --> 00:27:49.410
- So he's decided to take me on, has he?
- Please don't be too upset.

00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.470
How can you be so nonchalant?
Is that all you have to say?

00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:55.110
While that old man was pulling this stunt,
you didn't notice a thing.

00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:57.010
What have you been doing this whole time?

00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:59.380
To make sure word didn't get out,

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.950
the Chairman gave the order directly.

00:28:02.020 --> 00:28:03.420
I don't care if it was
a direct order or not.

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:06.290
You should have read his mind
like the back of your hand!

00:28:06.690 --> 00:28:09.960
You've been by my side for decades.
How can you still let me get blindsided?

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:12.330
You'll be able to achieve
your dream soon enough,

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:16.670
- so please try not to be so impatient.
- When? When is that going to be?

00:28:17.170 --> 00:28:21.270
With that old fox stabbing me in the back,
just when is that supposed to happen?

00:28:25.910 --> 00:28:26.910
Just you wait.

00:28:27.810 --> 00:28:30.410
I'm going to take over all of Dream!

00:28:47.930 --> 00:28:49.400
(The First Man)

00:28:49.470 --> 00:28:53.600
Dream Hotel's CEO was there too.
My generous sponsor.

00:28:53.770 --> 00:28:56.540
Why don't we bring her
one of our lunch boxes later?

00:28:56.810 --> 00:28:58.270
Are you going somewhere today?

00:28:58.410 --> 00:29:02.410
- What's it to you? Don't cross the line.
- Professor Kang Nam Bong?

00:29:02.950 --> 00:29:07.150
- I don't see Chef Kang Jun Ho anywhere.
- She's the spitting image of Director Ma.

00:29:07.450 --> 00:29:10.520
I'm here to deliver this
to CEO Chae Hwa Young.

00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:14.020
