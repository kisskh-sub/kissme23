WEBVTT

00:00:35.475 --> 00:00:37.681
This is me and Luna.

00:00:38.394 --> 00:00:41.650
Just friends, hanging out.

00:00:42.735 --> 00:00:46.030
You're not gonna believe
how we ended up in a relationship.

00:00:46.637 --> 00:00:51.072
If you can even call it that.

00:00:51.111 --> 00:00:52.111
Look at this.

00:00:52.700 --> 00:00:54.388
Even when she was
crying over her boyfriend,

00:00:54.413 --> 00:00:57.795
she still managed to take ten selfies.

00:00:58.002 --> 00:01:02.480
Wow, I really don’t understand why you
need to take pictures while crying. Right?

00:01:03.225 --> 00:01:05.119
Here, I'll give her a sad-react.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.344
- Luna?
- Hmm?

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:16.312
Have you ever had a boyfriend before?

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:17.706
Look, I see him bonding with plants
more often than with people.

00:02:18.168 --> 00:02:21.222
Such a waste, he’s cute,
but kind of weird.

00:02:21.816 --> 00:02:26.194
Oh, did you know I once saw him
at the plaza, selling flowers?

00:02:26.219 --> 00:02:27.470
Are they poor?

00:02:27.978 --> 00:02:29.897
Come on, maybe he’s
just doing a side hustle.

00:02:30.942 --> 00:02:32.568
Hey, what are you guys
standing up here for?

00:02:32.592 --> 00:02:34.272
Go get the other paint from the stockroom.

00:02:34.302 --> 00:02:35.570
Ah, okay, okay.

00:02:35.595 --> 00:02:37.180
You can go ahead first in the studio.

00:02:37.435 --> 00:02:38.781
We’ll just follow later.

00:02:38.806 --> 00:02:40.892
- Okay.
- Bye!

00:02:41.551 --> 00:02:43.365
Your head is full of gossip.

00:02:43.506 --> 00:02:45.049
You know too much!

00:03:06.484 --> 00:03:08.110
If you need to go home already...

00:03:08.648 --> 00:03:10.276
Is it okay if I go ahead?

00:03:10.612 --> 00:03:11.822
We have a family dinner.

00:03:11.983 --> 00:03:16.571
Oh, I’ll go with you. There aren’t many
jeepneys going to our place at night.

00:03:16.803 --> 00:03:19.367
It’s fine, I can handle this.
Go on, head home.

00:03:19.698 --> 00:03:22.533
See, Luna, this is why even
if you’re just in Grade 11,

00:03:22.558 --> 00:03:25.130
you were chosen as President
of the Artist Guild.

00:03:26.593 --> 00:03:29.791
Stop flattering me.
I know you’re all eager to go home.

00:03:29.816 --> 00:03:32.610
- Bye, Luna!
- Are you sure you can handle it?

00:03:32.635 --> 00:03:34.235
- Take care!
- Hey, just take it already.

00:03:34.379 --> 00:03:35.379
Do it.

00:03:36.473 --> 00:03:37.735
Let's go.

00:03:38.416 --> 00:03:39.816
This leftover is for you, Sir Dan.

00:03:40.323 --> 00:03:41.408
Give it to your wife.

00:03:41.661 --> 00:03:43.380
Wow, perfect, Raffy!

00:03:43.867 --> 00:03:46.077
It’s our wedding anniversary tomorrow.

00:03:46.148 --> 00:03:47.163
- Really?
- Mhmm!

00:03:47.188 --> 00:03:48.418
Happy Anniversary!

00:03:48.459 --> 00:03:49.936
Thanks, it’s beautiful!

00:03:50.428 --> 00:03:52.692
Wait, don’t you have
someone to give flowers to,

00:03:52.717 --> 00:03:55.753
like a girlfriend or
someone you’re courting?

00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:56.950
Not yet.

00:03:58.515 --> 00:03:59.854
I’m not ready for that.

00:04:00.634 --> 00:04:01.634
That’s boring.

00:04:01.786 --> 00:04:02.912
Sir,

00:04:03.394 --> 00:04:05.218
- Hm?
- do you have a key to the auditorium?

00:04:05.313 --> 00:04:06.327
Luna?

00:04:06.352 --> 00:04:08.823
Why are you still here?
I thought you all went home.

00:04:09.095 --> 00:04:10.415
I still have something to finish.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.816
Can I borrow the key? I’ll prep
the stage for tomorrow.

00:04:12.841 --> 00:04:13.841
Is that so?

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:15.180
Wait a sec.

00:04:15.862 --> 00:04:18.945
Isn’t Raffy your classmate?

00:04:19.407 --> 00:04:21.643
- Since grade 7.
- Raffy,

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:23.910
hand this to Luna.

00:04:26.724 --> 00:04:31.698
Raffy, go with Luna, so
she can finish up faster.

00:04:31.723 --> 00:04:33.713
Oh, I got it, Sir Dan. I can handle it.

00:04:33.738 --> 00:04:39.260
It’s hard to do it all alone, though.
So go with her. Raffy, go with her.

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:42.596
Because I can’t leave my post either.

00:04:42.621 --> 00:04:44.664
Of course, I’m a professional, right?

00:04:44.974 --> 00:04:46.545
I'm being paid above minimum, right?

00:04:46.675 --> 00:04:47.675
Go on.

00:04:51.773 --> 00:04:52.773
Oh!

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.150
What the hell!

00:04:55.331 --> 00:04:56.374
You need help?

00:04:59.355 --> 00:05:01.359
Why are you still at
school at this hour?

00:05:04.514 --> 00:05:06.352
The gate at home is locked.

00:05:07.251 --> 00:05:08.483
You're not allowed to knock?

00:05:10.824 --> 00:05:11.824
- Ugh!
- I’ll do it.

00:05:16.962 --> 00:05:17.962
Let me help you.

00:05:43.379 --> 00:05:45.561
Can you not touch me?

00:05:45.586 --> 00:05:47.386
Sorry, I'm so sorry.

00:05:58.798 --> 00:06:00.378
You know what, I’ll just
give you something to do

00:06:00.403 --> 00:06:02.131
so you’re not just standing
guard like a dog there.

00:06:03.068 --> 00:06:04.782
- Here, peel the back
- Alright.

00:06:04.807 --> 00:06:06.258
off that double-sided tape.

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:07.406
All of this?

00:06:07.431 --> 00:06:08.431
Obviously.

00:06:09.243 --> 00:06:10.243
Okay.

00:06:10.268 --> 00:06:11.431
There, give me the A.

00:06:13.479 --> 00:06:14.522
Give me, give me the E.

00:06:15.064 --> 00:06:16.064
Next, hand me the A.

00:06:21.904 --> 00:06:22.905
Where do you go home to?

00:06:23.056 --> 00:06:24.776
Let’s go together if
we’re on the same way.

00:06:25.241 --> 00:06:27.023
I can’t go home at this hour.

00:06:27.779 --> 00:06:29.113
I’ll just stay overnight here.

00:06:30.823 --> 00:06:32.918
So you’ll go straight to class like that?

00:06:33.308 --> 00:06:35.727
No shower? No brushing your teeth?

00:06:37.795 --> 00:06:38.795
Do I smell?

00:06:43.074 --> 00:06:45.588
Here. There’s a shower
at the Artist Guild studio.

00:06:45.619 --> 00:06:47.766
Complete toiletries.
You can take a bath there.

00:06:48.575 --> 00:06:49.575
Really?

00:06:49.974 --> 00:06:52.918
Just don’t use our
toothbrushes, okay?

00:06:52.943 --> 00:06:54.729
There’s mouthwash
there if you need to rinse.

00:06:55.043 --> 00:06:56.895
Just return the key to me tomorrow.

00:07:35.100 --> 00:07:38.069
Wow! Fresh from a shower, huh.

00:07:41.786 --> 00:07:42.786
You’re early.

00:07:43.045 --> 00:07:45.838
The pandesal at the
bakery near us runs out fast.

00:07:45.936 --> 00:07:48.689
I left early so I wouldn’t miss out.
Have you had breakfast?

00:07:48.989 --> 00:07:50.295
I don’t...

00:07:50.874 --> 00:07:53.234
- Eat this while it's still hot.
- I don’t eat breakfast.

00:07:54.946 --> 00:07:55.946
Hmm!

00:07:56.165 --> 00:07:58.895
Did you see the viral video
of Cathy and Arnold?

00:07:59.172 --> 00:08:01.062
- The ones from 9-Banahaw?
- Not yet.

00:08:01.119 --> 00:08:02.119
Watch it.

00:08:07.664 --> 00:08:09.833
Cassy, I really, really like you.

00:08:10.739 --> 00:08:16.202
Maybe you only see me as a best friend,
but for me, it’s more than that.

00:08:16.259 --> 00:08:18.636
So from now on, I want us
to be more than best friends.

00:08:18.810 --> 00:08:20.105
Right?

00:08:20.189 --> 00:08:23.673
Arnold, I've waited for that
from you for so long.

00:08:23.927 --> 00:08:25.356
You get giddy over that?

00:08:25.381 --> 00:08:27.465
Hmm! Gross!

00:08:27.490 --> 00:08:30.138
No, I don’t! It’s super cringe.

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.526
Then why do you look like that?

00:08:33.327 --> 00:08:34.662
I was just laughing.

00:08:34.716 --> 00:08:35.934
Like you said.

00:08:36.023 --> 00:08:37.023
Gross.

00:08:38.494 --> 00:08:39.837
Super gross.

00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:42.336
Hmm! Is that yours?

00:08:54.432 --> 00:08:55.808
I just picked it earlier.

00:08:56.684 --> 00:08:58.686
I’ll replant it at home.

00:09:03.990 --> 00:09:05.049
Do you want it?

00:09:06.902 --> 00:09:08.029
It’s yours.

00:09:10.846 --> 00:09:12.386
What will I do with that?

00:09:13.833 --> 00:09:15.208
I don’t know.

00:09:16.596 --> 00:09:19.849
Put it in a flower vase
at your house?

00:09:19.874 --> 00:09:21.764
Or something?

00:09:25.161 --> 00:09:27.330
Anyway, if you don’t want it,
it’s fine.

00:09:27.371 --> 00:09:30.163
[girls chattering]

00:09:30.437 --> 00:09:31.803
Hey! Here!

00:09:31.829 --> 00:09:33.923
Hey, share some pandesal!

00:09:34.229 --> 00:09:36.128
- Where’s that from?
- From me! I bought it at the bakery.

00:09:36.153 --> 00:09:37.162
I thought you made it.

00:09:37.187 --> 00:09:39.528
- Come on, sis! Then don't eat it!
- Don't eat!

00:09:39.553 --> 00:09:43.915
- Don't eat it!
- Alright then! You guys eat it all!

00:10:05.597 --> 00:10:07.141
Are they paying you here?

00:10:09.393 --> 00:10:11.935
And does this count as extracurricular?

00:10:14.034 --> 00:10:15.410
Nobody’s maintaining it.

00:10:15.921 --> 00:10:16.921
What a waste.

00:10:17.733 --> 00:10:18.733
Also,

00:10:19.402 --> 00:10:21.790
I’m really into plants.
Especially flowers.

00:10:21.831 --> 00:10:22.831
Why?

00:10:24.555 --> 00:10:25.765
They remind me of my parents.

00:10:26.325 --> 00:10:27.845
They were floral arrangers, like that?

00:10:29.252 --> 00:10:32.625
Maintaining the garden at home has always
been how we bonded as a family.

00:10:33.681 --> 00:10:34.993
So ever since they died,

00:10:35.947 --> 00:10:37.055
it’s been neglected.

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:40.870
Sorry.

00:10:52.007 --> 00:10:53.007
Here.

00:10:55.386 --> 00:10:56.386
What’s that?

00:10:56.992 --> 00:10:58.577
A flower. For you.

00:10:59.774 --> 00:11:00.942
Yes, I know. What I mean is...

00:11:01.350 --> 00:11:02.350
What for?

00:11:03.043 --> 00:11:04.843
Nothing. I just wanted
to give you something.

00:11:20.286 --> 00:11:21.286
Hmm.

00:11:21.996 --> 00:11:22.996
Ta-da!

00:11:23.789 --> 00:11:24.789
You colored it?

00:11:25.124 --> 00:11:26.124
Mhm!

00:11:26.292 --> 00:11:29.648
If you soak the stem of a
white rose in water with blue dye,

00:11:29.673 --> 00:11:31.181
the petals absorb the color.

00:11:31.801 --> 00:11:32.801
Nice!

00:11:33.684 --> 00:11:35.144
Try another color next time.

00:11:36.677 --> 00:11:37.866
That’s yours.

00:11:38.554 --> 00:11:39.572
Huh?

00:11:39.669 --> 00:11:41.003
That’s yours now.

00:11:42.266 --> 00:11:43.684
I gave them to you as a gift.

00:11:44.903 --> 00:11:45.903
Yeah.

00:11:45.974 --> 00:11:47.475
And now, they’re yours again.

00:11:51.775 --> 00:11:52.775
Look at this.

00:11:53.110 --> 00:11:54.630
Even when she was
crying over her boyfriend,

00:11:54.654 --> 00:11:58.157
she still managed
to take ten selfies.

00:11:58.365 --> 00:12:02.369
Wow, I really don’t get why you’d take
a picture of yourself crying. Right?

00:12:03.552 --> 00:12:05.331
Here, I'll give her a sad react.

00:12:11.119 --> 00:12:12.649
- Luna?
- Hmm?

00:12:14.688 --> 00:12:16.605
Have you ever had a boyfriend before?

00:12:23.078 --> 00:12:24.246
Are you going to court me?

00:12:33.561 --> 00:12:34.645
Can I?

00:12:41.240 --> 00:12:42.402
Do we really have to go through courting?

00:12:42.427 --> 00:12:43.427
Gross.

00:12:43.584 --> 00:12:44.596
Let’s just be together already.

00:12:46.049 --> 00:12:47.175
Are you serious?

00:12:48.086 --> 00:12:50.267
You're not going to add “just kidding”
at the end of your sentence?

00:12:50.345 --> 00:12:51.638
Yeah.

00:12:51.805 --> 00:12:52.848
But,

00:12:53.249 --> 00:12:54.831
this is my only condition, Raffy.

00:12:55.015 --> 00:12:57.666
How we are with each other now,
let’s just stay like this.

00:12:57.932 --> 00:12:58.932
Chill.

00:12:59.163 --> 00:13:00.653
No drama, nothing—

00:13:00.678 --> 00:13:01.678
Gross?

00:13:01.845 --> 00:13:02.989
Exactly.

00:13:03.245 --> 00:13:04.245
Understood?

00:13:05.239 --> 00:13:06.566
Ma’am, yes ma’am!

00:13:23.825 --> 00:13:26.091
Yeah, I’m happy that we’re together now.

00:13:26.909 --> 00:13:30.355
But she didn’t even make me work
hard for it before saying yes.

00:13:31.169 --> 00:13:32.712
So, what’s the problem?

00:13:33.657 --> 00:13:35.034
I kinda wish she did.

00:13:37.484 --> 00:13:39.277
I’ve never experienced courting someone.

00:13:41.176 --> 00:13:45.014
Just because she said yes doesn’t mean
you should stop courting her.

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.500
You know what, Raffy?

00:13:47.743 --> 00:13:50.287
Every day God made,

00:13:50.810 --> 00:13:57.025
I treat as another opportunity to show
and make my wife feel how much I love her.

00:13:57.359 --> 00:14:00.703
So if you want to do
something to make Luna feel

00:14:01.221 --> 00:14:02.722
that she’s special to you,

00:14:02.813 --> 00:14:03.939
just do it.

00:14:05.671 --> 00:14:07.548
Well, that’s the problem, Sir Dan.

00:14:08.371 --> 00:14:09.789
She doesn’t like that.

00:14:11.664 --> 00:14:12.665
It’s like...

00:14:14.196 --> 00:14:15.385
she has a wall.

00:14:15.608 --> 00:14:17.212
She’s just not used to it.

00:14:17.504 --> 00:14:18.964
As time goes on,

00:14:19.548 --> 00:14:20.966
the wall will come down.

00:14:28.182 --> 00:14:29.641
I’m not weight conscious, okay?

00:14:29.850 --> 00:14:32.309
But when I weighed
myself earlier at the clinic,

00:14:32.333 --> 00:14:34.975
I was three kilos lighter
compared to last month.

00:14:35.022 --> 00:14:36.582
- Congrats!
- Mhmm!

00:14:36.691 --> 00:14:37.900
And because of that...

00:14:48.672 --> 00:14:50.573
There was a surprise quiz
and I got a perfect score.

00:14:50.598 --> 00:14:53.353
I just relied on stock knowledge but bam!

00:14:53.378 --> 00:14:56.089
Wow, 30 out of 30! Look!

00:14:56.460 --> 00:14:57.461
Good job!

00:15:12.017 --> 00:15:13.017
What’s that for?

00:15:14.436 --> 00:15:15.836
We’ve been together for two months.

00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:22.360
Hmm!

00:15:22.403 --> 00:15:23.403
For you.

00:15:23.445 --> 00:15:24.445
I made it.

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:29.034
Have a look!

00:15:32.788 --> 00:15:33.705
A coaster.

00:15:33.819 --> 00:15:35.821
Made from resin. I made it.

00:15:35.967 --> 00:15:36.967
Oh!

00:15:38.419 --> 00:15:39.586
Hmm.

00:15:40.754 --> 00:15:43.132
You can put this in your
locker so it smells nice.

00:15:43.757 --> 00:15:44.757
And then,

00:15:44.958 --> 00:15:45.958
hmm,

00:15:47.553 --> 00:15:48.553
bookmarks.

00:15:48.637 --> 00:15:49.721
I made them too.

00:15:57.563 --> 00:16:00.008
Why do you keep returning
everything I give you?

00:16:02.294 --> 00:16:03.294
Uh...

00:16:03.819 --> 00:16:06.029
Well, you gave them
to me. So, they’re mine.

00:16:06.487 --> 00:16:09.341
And because they’re mine, I have the
right to do whatever I want with them.

00:16:09.366 --> 00:16:12.369
And what I want is to gift them back to you
with my artistic touch.

00:16:12.743 --> 00:16:13.743
Are we good with that?

00:16:14.621 --> 00:16:15.831
You don’t have to do that.

00:16:16.832 --> 00:16:18.374
I’m not expecting anything in return.

00:16:18.485 --> 00:16:19.485
You too, Raffy.

00:16:19.659 --> 00:16:21.922
You don’t need to give me flowers.

00:16:22.356 --> 00:16:24.691
To be honest, it’s kind of...

00:16:27.134 --> 00:16:29.011
- Kind of gross.
- Gross?

00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:31.013
What’s so gross about that?

00:16:31.588 --> 00:16:33.384
I just want to make you feel special

00:16:33.409 --> 00:16:36.077
by giving you flowers that I
grew and took care of myself.

00:16:36.101 --> 00:16:37.477
You really don’t have to do that!

00:16:37.502 --> 00:16:38.753
Luna, I want to!

00:16:39.038 --> 00:16:41.498
Our agreement was to
keep things chill. So, why?

00:16:41.523 --> 00:16:42.774
Because I love you!

00:17:00.751 --> 00:17:03.629
Ma, I’m busy. Can you call later?

00:17:05.221 --> 00:17:06.221
You're here?

00:17:07.412 --> 00:17:08.914
At school? Why?

00:17:13.948 --> 00:17:14.948
Ma!

00:17:16.659 --> 00:17:17.659
Hon,

00:17:17.684 --> 00:17:20.521
do you have a thousand pesos?
I just have somewhere to go to.

00:17:20.812 --> 00:17:21.812
Where?

00:17:22.564 --> 00:17:24.172
A friend’s birthday.

00:17:24.707 --> 00:17:27.168
Where exactly? Why would the fare
cost a thousand pesos?

00:17:27.193 --> 00:17:28.445
In Bulacan.

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:29.470
Bulacan?

00:17:30.091 --> 00:17:32.260
You’re going to see that
guy again, aren’t you?

00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.817
You said you were done with him.
He’s just milking you for money, Ma.

00:17:36.634 --> 00:17:38.386
I also have the right

00:17:38.693 --> 00:17:39.693
to be happy.

00:17:40.396 --> 00:17:42.052
Since the day that I gave birth to you,

00:17:42.716 --> 00:17:44.710
my life lost its happiness.

00:17:45.587 --> 00:17:46.672
I’m tired.

00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.212
I’m so sick of raising you.

00:17:53.428 --> 00:17:54.598
Just give me your cellphone,

00:17:54.623 --> 00:17:55.624
- I’ll pawn it.
- No way.

00:17:55.739 --> 00:17:56.740
No way!

00:17:56.765 --> 00:17:57.824
I bought that!

00:17:57.849 --> 00:17:58.992
That’s my cellphone!

00:17:59.017 --> 00:18:00.601
Sell your own cellphone!

00:18:00.626 --> 00:18:02.946
- Give it to me!
- What’s wrong with you, Ma? This is mine!

00:18:06.733 --> 00:18:09.111
You and your aunt meddle too much.

00:18:09.574 --> 00:18:11.909
Why don’t you live together,
since you’re both so nosy!

00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:25.960
Luna?

00:18:32.634 --> 00:18:33.635
Are you okay?

00:18:34.928 --> 00:18:35.928
Why?

00:18:36.655 --> 00:18:38.073
Do you think I’m pitiful?

00:18:38.682 --> 00:18:40.267
Do you think I’m sad?

00:18:40.561 --> 00:18:43.773
I’m used to my mom’s craziness,
so stop looking at me like that.

00:18:53.280 --> 00:18:54.280
It's okay.

00:19:02.748 --> 00:19:03.790
It's okay.

00:19:16.762 --> 00:19:18.388
This is my stop. Take care.

00:19:19.695 --> 00:19:21.155
Who else is with you there?

00:19:22.527 --> 00:19:23.527
No one.

00:19:24.603 --> 00:19:25.771
Your dad? Is he not there?

00:19:26.125 --> 00:19:27.168
I don’t have a father.

00:19:29.589 --> 00:19:32.154
Don’t you have other relatives
you can stay with?

00:19:32.611 --> 00:19:34.696
It’s not my first time
being left alone at home.

00:19:34.863 --> 00:19:37.032
My mom goes out more than I do.

00:19:37.199 --> 00:19:38.367
Alright, bye now.

00:19:44.873 --> 00:19:45.873
I’ll keep you company.

00:19:48.126 --> 00:19:49.586
If that’s okay with you.

00:19:56.537 --> 00:19:57.955
Is there any food in the fridge?

00:19:58.472 --> 00:19:59.806
I can cook something for you.

00:20:01.598 --> 00:20:03.350
I don’t know. Just check.

00:20:07.057 --> 00:20:08.600
Do you want something in particular?

00:20:09.189 --> 00:20:10.649
Anything, up to you.

00:20:15.987 --> 00:20:17.280
Oh, by the way.

00:20:18.198 --> 00:20:19.491
While you don’t have a phone,

00:20:20.404 --> 00:20:21.468
you can use mine.

00:20:22.462 --> 00:20:23.593
I got it unlocked already.

00:20:27.501 --> 00:20:30.276
What, so I could go through your inbox?

00:20:31.292 --> 00:20:32.376
I have nothing to hide.

00:20:32.452 --> 00:20:33.452
I’m a good boy.

00:20:44.350 --> 00:20:45.434
Raffy,

00:20:49.667 --> 00:20:51.072
do you really love me?

00:20:57.413 --> 00:20:58.917
Of course I love you!

00:21:02.383 --> 00:21:03.509
What’s on your mind?

00:21:10.584 --> 00:21:13.134
Do you really love me,
or am I just your distraction?

00:21:14.379 --> 00:21:15.672
Distraction from what?

00:21:16.826 --> 00:21:18.303
From your life issues.

00:21:18.467 --> 00:21:19.926
You don’t want to go home, right?

00:21:20.205 --> 00:21:23.458
- It’s not that I don’t want to.
- Sir Dan already told me, Raffy.

00:21:28.059 --> 00:21:30.269
You sell flowers every night

00:21:30.294 --> 00:21:33.798
because you don’t want to
ask your siblings for allowance.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:36.717
You’d rather stay late
at school than go home

00:21:36.742 --> 00:21:38.917
because you don’t want to bother them.

00:21:41.303 --> 00:21:45.224
Maybe I’m just your distraction
because you can’t face your own problems?

00:21:49.748 --> 00:21:50.748
How about me?

00:21:51.208 --> 00:21:53.712
Am I just your distraction
from your life's problems?

00:21:55.785 --> 00:21:56.785
Yeah.

00:22:02.570 --> 00:22:04.697
Whatever you can give me,

00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:06.180
I’ll take it.

00:22:07.086 --> 00:22:08.171
What?

00:22:10.068 --> 00:22:12.613
It’s okay with me if you only
see me as a distraction.

00:22:13.119 --> 00:22:14.119
At least,

00:22:14.144 --> 00:22:15.544
I serve a purpose in your life.

00:22:16.388 --> 00:22:17.389
Loser!

00:22:18.485 --> 00:22:20.403
Do you hear yourself, huh?

00:22:20.593 --> 00:22:22.345
That’s literally gross!

00:22:22.593 --> 00:22:25.011
You’re making an effort for me
but it’s okay that you get nothing back?

00:22:25.036 --> 00:22:26.634
You’re content with that?

00:22:26.746 --> 00:22:29.498
Why don't you demand, Raffy!
Ask for more!

00:22:29.538 --> 00:22:34.083
Tell me, "Luna, you’re so dry! Can you
at least match my efforts?" Or maybe,

00:22:34.108 --> 00:22:37.945
"Luna, if you really love me,
why are you afraid to show it?" Like that!

00:22:39.303 --> 00:22:40.306
I don't want to.

00:22:40.370 --> 00:22:41.455
Why?

00:22:44.002 --> 00:22:45.361
Because I don’t want to lose you.

00:22:47.264 --> 00:22:49.224
I’m already happy with what you're giving.

00:22:49.558 --> 00:22:51.247
That’s better than nothing.

00:23:00.694 --> 00:23:01.820
You’re so weak.

00:23:03.196 --> 00:23:04.698
Be straight with me.

00:23:07.409 --> 00:23:09.202
I don’t have parents anymore, Luna.

00:23:10.579 --> 00:23:11.580
It’s been ten years.

00:23:13.915 --> 00:23:15.125
My older sister and brother

00:23:16.209 --> 00:23:17.377
have their own lives.

00:23:18.075 --> 00:23:20.519
I’m sure they just want
me to finish high school

00:23:20.616 --> 00:23:22.277
so I won’t be their
responsibility anymore.

00:23:22.577 --> 00:23:23.703
And if you ask me,

00:23:23.846 --> 00:23:25.130
that’s what I want too.

00:23:27.141 --> 00:23:29.018
I don’t want to be a burden to them.

00:23:34.019 --> 00:23:35.604
You know I despise going home?

00:23:36.607 --> 00:23:38.734
Because that’s how I
feel whenever I’m home.

00:23:38.879 --> 00:23:40.089
A burden!

00:23:40.905 --> 00:23:43.574
You’re the only reason
I don’t feel alone.

00:23:44.585 --> 00:23:46.009
And should I gamble that?

00:23:47.112 --> 00:23:48.947
By demanding more from you?

00:23:51.954 --> 00:23:55.207
Luna, I don’t care if you
can’t reciprocate my efforts.

00:23:56.419 --> 00:23:59.124
If I’m just your distraction
from your life’s crap, then fine!

00:23:59.263 --> 00:24:00.802
I’m consenting to this!

00:24:10.013 --> 00:24:11.056
Get changed.

00:24:11.306 --> 00:24:12.474
Take me to your house.

00:24:12.857 --> 00:24:13.941
Why?

00:24:15.981 --> 00:24:18.900
Why do they lock it when
they know you’re not home yet?

00:24:21.684 --> 00:24:24.060
Here’s the thing—
They’re already asleep by 6 PM,

00:24:24.085 --> 00:24:27.797
because they have to wake up at 3 AM
for their work at the airport.

00:24:27.887 --> 00:24:30.489
And since I usually
come home late,

00:24:31.004 --> 00:24:33.214
they lock the gate before
going to bed for safety.

00:24:33.288 --> 00:24:35.331
And you don’t have a key because?

00:24:35.701 --> 00:24:37.005
I misplaced it?

00:24:37.933 --> 00:24:40.185
Then why didn’t you
have a duplicate made?

00:24:40.335 --> 00:24:41.795
I don’t want to bother them.

00:24:42.003 --> 00:24:43.755
This gate is creaky
when you open it.

00:24:43.788 --> 00:24:44.797
And...

00:24:44.822 --> 00:24:46.877
when I get inside, I still have
to knock on the front door,

00:24:46.902 --> 00:24:48.470
which is locked from the inside.

00:24:48.495 --> 00:24:49.639
I don’t want to wake them up.

00:24:49.719 --> 00:24:53.133
Actually, I used to wait
outside here until 3 AM,

00:24:53.158 --> 00:24:56.315
then I realized that it’s
better to kill time at school

00:24:56.340 --> 00:24:58.318
chatting with Sir Dan.

00:25:01.790 --> 00:25:02.791
What?

00:25:10.029 --> 00:25:11.781
Luna, what are you doing?

00:25:12.468 --> 00:25:15.136
A demo to show you
how small your problem is.

00:25:15.161 --> 00:25:16.204
Stay there!

00:25:16.454 --> 00:25:17.454
Hey, stop!

00:25:18.571 --> 00:25:19.571
Luna!

00:25:20.292 --> 00:25:21.501
Luna, what are you doing?

00:25:23.758 --> 00:25:28.018
Luna! Luna, stop!
What are you doing? Stop!

00:25:28.925 --> 00:25:29.925
What?

00:25:32.349 --> 00:25:35.632
What are you talking about? I don't
understand you! If I fall down from here...

00:25:35.689 --> 00:25:38.734
What the heck, Raf! Do you know
what time is it? It’s eleven already!

00:25:39.959 --> 00:25:41.419
Sorry, Kris.

00:25:43.875 --> 00:25:45.292
Good evening.

00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:46.400
Who are you?

00:25:50.321 --> 00:25:52.073
I’m Raffy’s girlfriend.

00:25:52.251 --> 00:25:56.380
Well, your brother lost his gate key.

00:25:56.864 --> 00:25:59.371
Why didn’t you duplicate
mine and Bry's keys?

00:25:59.396 --> 00:26:02.107
Right? That’s exactly what I told him.

00:26:06.312 --> 00:26:08.314
You're selling flowers on the street?

00:26:09.549 --> 00:26:12.266
But Bry and I already
give you allowance.

00:26:13.762 --> 00:26:14.870
Is it not enough?

00:26:15.513 --> 00:26:16.525
Sometimes.

00:26:17.131 --> 00:26:21.177
Especially when I need to buy things
for school requirements.

00:26:23.396 --> 00:26:24.814
Why didn’t you say so?

00:26:30.222 --> 00:26:32.599
I don’t want to be a burden, Bry.

00:26:35.326 --> 00:26:41.188
Ever since Mom and Dad died,
I saw how hard the two of you worked.

00:26:42.824 --> 00:26:44.534
And you two sacrificed a lot,

00:26:45.005 --> 00:26:46.841
just so we could get by.

00:26:48.134 --> 00:26:49.134
But,

00:26:49.274 --> 00:26:51.985
I started to feel invisible here at home.

00:26:53.075 --> 00:26:54.075
Often,

00:26:54.575 --> 00:26:55.659
when I get home,

00:26:56.532 --> 00:26:57.825
the gate is already locked.

00:26:58.944 --> 00:27:03.115
Then, there’s no food.

00:27:04.508 --> 00:27:08.429
But I get it. You’re busy. Tired.

00:27:10.197 --> 00:27:14.076
It would be so needy and ungrateful
of me to demand attention.

00:27:15.207 --> 00:27:17.362
When you’re the ones supporting me.

00:27:21.871 --> 00:27:22.871
But,

00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:25.250
I promise,

00:27:26.334 --> 00:27:28.545
Bry, Kris,

00:27:29.439 --> 00:27:30.690
I will study well,

00:27:31.405 --> 00:27:34.450
and I will finish high school
as soon as possible,

00:27:35.415 --> 00:27:37.459
so you won’t have to
take care of me anymore.

00:27:42.642 --> 00:27:43.642
Raf,

00:27:44.936 --> 00:27:46.688
Raf, you’re not a burden to us.

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:48.230
Get it?

00:27:48.898 --> 00:27:50.400
We’re family here.

00:27:52.361 --> 00:27:54.280
And no matter what happens,

00:27:54.737 --> 00:27:56.698
you will always be our baby brother.

00:27:57.323 --> 00:27:58.323
Okay?

00:28:00.577 --> 00:28:01.578
Sorry, okay?

00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:04.360
If we ever made you feel invisible,

00:28:06.308 --> 00:28:07.726
we didn’t mean to.

Just kidding.

00:29:20.999 --> 00:29:22.125
How’s your mom?

00:29:23.624 --> 00:29:25.376
She’s in Bulacan.

00:29:25.755 --> 00:29:28.215
I’ll stay at my aunt’s place
while she’s away.

00:29:32.502 --> 00:29:33.502
Raffy...

00:29:34.379 --> 00:29:36.089
Can we talk later?

00:29:38.007 --> 00:29:39.007
About what?

00:29:41.259 --> 00:29:42.343
About...

00:29:44.514 --> 00:29:45.514
us.

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:48.226
What do you want?

00:29:49.576 --> 00:29:53.310
Holding hands? Couple pics
on social media?

00:29:53.587 --> 00:29:54.670
A kiss?

00:29:58.278 --> 00:30:00.487
I don’t want to be too demanding.

00:30:00.512 --> 00:30:02.931
That’s why we’re talking, right?

00:30:03.771 --> 00:30:07.631
Tell me directly, what do you want
from me as your girlfriend.

00:30:07.745 --> 00:30:09.579
And don’t be afraid to be honest,

00:30:09.604 --> 00:30:12.528
because just because you ask
doesn’t mean I’ll give it.

00:30:12.861 --> 00:30:16.990
If I can’t give it, or can’t
give it fully, I’ll tell you.

00:30:21.256 --> 00:30:22.729
How about...

00:30:23.239 --> 00:30:24.823
holding hands?

00:30:24.848 --> 00:30:25.894
In public?

00:30:31.119 --> 00:30:32.119
Okay.

00:30:33.218 --> 00:30:34.263
How about...

00:30:35.273 --> 00:30:38.209
I’ll change my profile
pictures on social media?

00:30:38.293 --> 00:30:39.568
I’ll put our picture together.

00:30:39.593 --> 00:30:41.762
Ew! Gross.

00:30:42.829 --> 00:30:47.909
But if you want to post videos
or pictures of us together,

00:30:47.934 --> 00:30:50.335
like on your feed or in
your story, go ahead.

00:30:50.413 --> 00:30:51.653
Even if it’s set to public?

00:30:51.789 --> 00:30:52.824
Hmm.

00:30:53.538 --> 00:30:54.581
Okay.

00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:56.460
Hmm.

00:30:56.502 --> 00:30:57.616
How about...

00:30:57.673 --> 00:30:59.138
a kiss in public?

00:30:59.669 --> 00:31:02.255
Even just on the cheek.
Even just on the cheek.

00:31:02.692 --> 00:31:03.860
Just keep it low key.

00:31:04.223 --> 00:31:05.788
I don’t want too much attention.

00:31:07.722 --> 00:31:08.722
Okay.

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:12.146
But, if...

00:31:12.557 --> 00:31:13.892
a kiss in private,

00:31:15.521 --> 00:31:16.814
I won’t refuse.

00:31:22.091 --> 00:31:23.171
Hold on.

00:31:23.196 --> 00:31:24.356

Let's finish up first.

Or,

00:32:55.163 --> 00:32:56.849
you can all go home now.
I’ll finish up in here.

00:32:59.076 --> 00:33:02.955

just want the studio to yourselves.

But seriously, Luna.

00:33:10.701 --> 00:33:14.246
You often send us home early
even if the work isn’t finished.

00:33:14.651 --> 00:33:15.944
So as payback,

00:33:15.984 --> 00:33:17.941

00:35:40.736 --> 00:35:42.321
What?

Hey!

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.675
Don’t tell me all of that is for me.

00:35:54.842 --> 00:35:56.551
Nope! I’ll sell it.

00:35:57.049 --> 00:35:59.427
But I thought Kris didn’t want you to.

00:35:59.839 --> 00:36:02.467
I’m raising money
to buy you a phone.

00:36:04.222 --> 00:36:05.235
What?

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:06.700
Is it okay if it’s just a cheap one?

00:36:07.515 --> 00:36:09.058
I found one online.

00:36:09.344 --> 00:36:11.429
Secondhand, only five thousand.

00:36:11.473 --> 00:36:14.778
It’s not much, but at least
you can use social media.

00:36:14.845 --> 00:36:17.265
To take videos or pictures.

00:36:18.835 --> 00:36:21.212
You just want me
to call you with that.

00:36:22.087 --> 00:36:23.087
That too.

00:36:24.142 --> 00:36:25.769
But seriously, Raffy,

00:36:26.195 --> 00:36:27.613
you don’t have to do this.

00:36:27.954 --> 00:36:28.954
It’s fine,

00:36:29.514 --> 00:36:30.598
this is practice for me.

00:36:31.408 --> 00:36:32.493
Practice for what?

00:36:33.867 --> 00:36:35.327
For when we get married.

00:36:36.184 --> 00:36:38.105
I need to learn how
to provide for my wife.

00:36:41.889 --> 00:36:44.730
You’re too much!

00:36:44.783 --> 00:36:46.352
- Flowers!
- Flowers!

00:36:46.377 --> 00:36:47.919
Flowers here!

00:36:48.731 --> 00:36:52.041
- For your wife! Or for your girlfriend!
- Wow!

00:36:52.066 --> 00:36:58.446
Or for your parents! For your grandparents!
For anyone you love in life!

00:36:58.471 --> 00:37:02.767
Or even if you don’t love them!
And you just want to suck up!

00:37:08.143 --> 00:37:09.325
We should break up.

00:37:09.908 --> 00:37:11.325
This is Luna and me

00:37:11.377 --> 00:37:13.421
when we decided to end things.

00:37:13.546 --> 00:37:15.130
Or should I say,

00:37:15.403 --> 00:37:18.049
when she decided to end things,

00:37:18.639 --> 00:37:19.974
unilaterally.

00:37:20.046 --> 00:37:21.046
Why?

00:37:21.971 --> 00:37:23.305
Alright, class!

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:28.661
Who will represent 11-Alitaptap
in the lakan and lakambini of

00:37:28.686 --> 00:37:30.138
Dalisay High?

00:37:32.023 --> 00:37:35.109
Okay, guys, guys, listen.

00:37:35.547 --> 00:37:38.633
Okay, I have a suggestion
as your class president.

00:37:39.039 --> 00:37:40.374
For lakan,

00:37:41.199 --> 00:37:42.826
no other than...

00:37:44.077 --> 00:37:45.996
Raffy Murillo!

00:37:46.073 --> 00:37:51.632
[applauding, cheering]

00:37:51.709 --> 00:37:54.459
Okay, quiet, quiet!

00:37:54.576 --> 00:37:56.703
For lakambini…

00:37:58.962 --> 00:38:01.089
Sydney Bengco!

00:38:01.277 --> 00:38:05.184
[applauding, cheering]

00:38:05.310 --> 00:38:07.074
Well, Ma'am,

00:38:07.170 --> 00:38:08.463
I’m honored.

00:38:08.655 --> 00:38:11.753
But, I’ll have to consult
with my parents first.

00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:18.186
That's alright Ma'am. Her parents
are supportive when it comes to pageants.

00:38:18.529 --> 00:38:19.529
Yes?

00:38:21.521 --> 00:38:22.563
I volunteer.

00:38:29.036 --> 00:38:31.298
I already told Bry and Kris.

00:38:31.474 --> 00:38:34.269
They can't promise to come
to the pageant because they have work,

00:38:34.543 --> 00:38:37.337
but they said if I
need to buy anything,

00:38:37.362 --> 00:38:40.419
like a props or costume,
they're willing to support.

00:38:42.510 --> 00:38:43.510
Luna,

00:38:43.539 --> 00:38:44.539
are you sure?

00:38:45.471 --> 00:38:46.471
About what?

00:38:49.809 --> 00:38:51.060
About the pageant.

00:38:53.813 --> 00:38:54.813
Of course.

00:38:55.804 --> 00:38:57.014
You think I can’t win?

00:39:01.483 --> 00:39:02.654
That’s not what I meant.

00:39:05.483 --> 00:39:08.778
I just didn’t think you’re the type
to join something like that.

00:39:10.621 --> 00:39:11.621
You too.

00:39:13.415 --> 00:39:14.415
Fair enough.

00:39:16.418 --> 00:39:17.586
But if that’s what you want,

00:39:18.087 --> 00:39:19.713
I’ll support you 100%.

00:39:22.850 --> 00:39:24.397
- Let’s take a picture.
- Let's go.

00:39:26.326 --> 00:39:28.328
Not to be crabby, okay?

00:39:28.622 --> 00:39:29.612
But...

00:39:29.649 --> 00:39:31.776
it’s unlikely Luna will win the pageant.

00:39:32.972 --> 00:39:33.972
How about you, Tim?

00:39:34.399 --> 00:39:37.026
Who’s your representative
from 11-Gamu-gamo for lakambini?

00:39:37.051 --> 00:39:38.143
Zoey, of course.

00:39:38.168 --> 00:39:39.176
- Huh?
- Really?

00:39:39.201 --> 00:39:42.461
- Zoey? As in Zoey Palomares?
- No way...

00:39:42.486 --> 00:39:43.588
Yeah, I have a crush on her.

00:39:43.665 --> 00:39:46.668
It’s over, girl! Alitaptap’s
really going to lose.

00:39:46.907 --> 00:39:47.928
Guys,

00:39:47.952 --> 00:39:50.245
I don’t know what
got into Luna’s head.

00:39:51.183 --> 00:39:53.685
Does she think she’s
prettier than Sydney?

00:39:53.710 --> 00:39:55.307
Hey, that’s harsh.

00:39:55.405 --> 00:39:57.178
How many of you are in class?

00:39:57.295 --> 00:39:59.900
Not one of you objected
when she volunteered?

00:40:00.914 --> 00:40:03.874
What did you want us to say?

00:40:04.153 --> 00:40:08.112
"Hey, Luna! Girl! Don’t compete anymore,
you’re not going to win anyway."

00:40:08.137 --> 00:40:09.250
Really?

00:40:10.156 --> 00:40:11.323
I don’t get them.

00:40:11.348 --> 00:40:13.188
Guys, guys.

00:40:14.002 --> 00:40:15.045
Isn’t it obvious?

00:40:16.206 --> 00:40:18.167
She volunteered because of Raffy.

00:40:18.746 --> 00:40:20.666
She doesn’t want to be
apart from her boyfriend.

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:22.382
So clingy, right?

00:40:22.484 --> 00:40:24.963
She thinks one of the other
candidates will steal Raffy?

00:40:24.987 --> 00:40:25.987
Yes.

00:40:26.196 --> 00:40:27.196
Or...

00:40:27.987 --> 00:40:30.108
maybe she’s scared

00:40:30.890 --> 00:40:32.807
that Raffy might win.

00:40:33.129 --> 00:40:35.022
She’ll be left behind.

00:40:35.247 --> 00:40:36.289
Good point, good point.

00:40:36.314 --> 00:40:39.018
Like people will say—

00:40:39.713 --> 00:40:40.713
"Oh,"

00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:43.626
"Raffy’s too handsome for Luna."

00:40:43.714 --> 00:40:47.209
Raffy should find
someone who matches him.

00:40:47.260 --> 00:40:48.428
What if it were you instead?

00:40:48.453 --> 00:40:50.413
Wow, you’re so mean to Luna!

00:40:50.436 --> 00:40:55.034
[overlapping chatter]

00:40:55.059 --> 00:40:56.226
Are you guys done?

00:40:59.125 --> 00:41:00.777
- Luna...
- Um...

00:41:00.802 --> 00:41:02.164
We're not yet finished
but we're almost there!

00:41:02.188 --> 00:41:03.483
We only have this left.

00:41:03.508 --> 00:41:05.653
Okay, fine, I’ll help you. But...

00:41:06.025 --> 00:41:09.028
I’ll leave right after, okay?
We have rehearsals at six.

00:41:09.949 --> 00:41:13.410
- Alright, let’s go.
- Five, six, seven, eight, and two.

00:41:13.619 --> 00:41:16.996
And chest. And a one, two, three, four.

00:41:16.997 --> 00:41:20.017
And a one, two, three.

00:41:20.042 --> 00:41:25.481
And slide. And a one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:41:25.506 --> 00:41:30.301
And a one, two,
three, four, then, pose.

00:41:30.326 --> 00:41:32.048
What’s that, Cabigting?

00:41:32.807 --> 00:41:33.807
Are you up for this?

00:41:35.057 --> 00:41:36.057
Sorry, sir.

00:41:39.084 --> 00:41:40.085
You need help?

00:41:41.539 --> 00:41:42.539
From the top!

00:41:42.655 --> 00:41:45.032
You know what I’m thinking
for the sportswear portion?

00:41:45.057 --> 00:41:47.642
I’ll wear something equestrian,
or maybe a racer outfit.

00:41:47.667 --> 00:41:48.667
What do you think?

00:41:48.917 --> 00:41:50.328
- That's cool!
- Right?

00:41:50.353 --> 00:41:51.840
It gives off that lady boss vibe.

00:41:52.116 --> 00:41:53.879
Hey! This one!

00:41:54.177 --> 00:41:55.386
It suits you.

00:41:55.411 --> 00:41:57.454
Like a Cristiano Ronaldo look.

00:41:57.913 --> 00:42:02.751
We’ll just find matching
high socks and shorts.

00:42:03.191 --> 00:42:04.359
Actually,

00:42:04.545 --> 00:42:06.184
- Norwin and I were thinking…
- Hmm?

00:42:06.387 --> 00:42:07.415
To make it unique,

00:42:07.440 --> 00:42:11.045
I’ll do fire dancing for the sportswear.
Polynesian vibe.

00:42:11.510 --> 00:42:15.972
With glow-in-the-dark henna
tattoos on my legs, arms, and chest.

00:42:15.997 --> 00:42:17.001
Chest?

00:42:18.811 --> 00:42:20.266
So you’ll go topless?

00:42:20.685 --> 00:42:22.520
Yeah, like Maui in Moana.

00:42:22.545 --> 00:42:24.547
- And with accessories—
- No, I don’t like it,

00:42:25.799 --> 00:42:26.895
that’s too revealing.

00:42:27.401 --> 00:42:30.452
Just wear a basketball jersey,
since you’re a basketball player anyway.

00:42:31.155 --> 00:42:33.865
But we already started
practicing the fire dancing.

00:42:33.890 --> 00:42:34.890
I said I don’t want that.

00:42:35.183 --> 00:42:37.175
You should’ve asked me first, right?

00:42:38.422 --> 00:42:41.174
You’re the only one
allowed to touch my body.

00:42:42.666 --> 00:42:45.776
Anyone else can only look.

00:42:49.732 --> 00:42:50.732
No.

00:42:54.409 --> 00:42:58.329
Candidate number whatever
is Raffy Murillo!

00:43:02.325 --> 00:43:05.928
Good evening, wonderful people
of Don Anselmo Dalisay High!

00:43:05.953 --> 00:43:10.027
I am the Lakan representing
Grade 11-Alitaptap.

00:43:10.069 --> 00:43:12.744
Rafael Xavier A. Murillo!

00:43:14.576 --> 00:43:18.746
Candidate number something,
Luna Cabigting!

00:43:22.450 --> 00:43:24.242
Good evening, Dalisay High!

00:43:24.308 --> 00:43:27.211
I’m Maria Luna P. Cabigting. The...

00:43:27.368 --> 00:43:29.478
the Lakambini of 11-Alitaptap!

00:43:29.896 --> 00:43:32.671
Wait. Hold on. Do this
for me real quick. Just like this.

00:43:33.816 --> 00:43:34.816
Smile.

00:43:35.469 --> 00:43:41.266
Walk. One, two. Push.
Like that!

00:43:41.634 --> 00:43:48.228
Candidate number whatever, I’m the
Lakambini of 11-Alitaptap, Luna Cabigting!

00:43:48.827 --> 00:43:49.869
What was that?

00:43:49.894 --> 00:43:53.114
Why add that extra move? I’ve never
seen a contestant do that ever.

00:43:53.139 --> 00:43:55.640
No, just try it so we’ll
know if you can do it.

00:43:55.665 --> 00:43:57.292
I don’t want to.

00:43:58.318 --> 00:44:00.361
Gross, Norwin, why are you forcing me?

00:44:00.386 --> 00:44:02.403
Because we’re at a disadvantage with you!

00:44:03.205 --> 00:44:06.617
You need to catch the judges
attention so they’ll remember you.

00:44:06.667 --> 00:44:08.252
Because real talk, Luna,

00:44:08.319 --> 00:44:09.821
compared to your competitors,

00:44:10.139 --> 00:44:12.057
you are forgettable!

00:44:14.900 --> 00:44:17.569
And you think those little
shoulder moves will help?

00:44:17.594 --> 00:44:19.488
That is why we need to try, right?

00:44:19.513 --> 00:44:20.779
Why did you even
volunteer in the first place?

00:44:20.804 --> 00:44:22.849
- Sydney didn’t want to, right?
- She did want to!

00:44:22.975 --> 00:44:24.017
She wanted to, sis.

00:44:24.143 --> 00:44:25.143
But you jumped ahead of her.

00:44:25.168 --> 00:44:27.837
Didn’t she say she just had
to ask her parents’ permission?

00:44:28.981 --> 00:44:29.981
Crazy.

00:44:33.377 --> 00:44:34.986
- Luna!
- What?

00:44:35.441 --> 00:44:38.083
Luna, you don’t have to do
this pageant if it’s hard for you.

00:44:38.506 --> 00:44:40.299
- You agree with Norwin, don’t you?
- Huh?

00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:41.882
Damn it, Raf!

00:44:41.953 --> 00:44:45.126
He was trash-talking me,
and you didn’t do anything!

00:44:45.164 --> 00:44:46.974
You didn’t say a word,
you didn’t even stop him!

00:44:46.999 --> 00:44:48.202
You didn’t defend me

00:44:48.227 --> 00:44:50.642
because you also think I don’t
stand a chance in this pageant!

00:44:50.692 --> 00:44:53.861
Luna, in my eyes, you’re the most
beautiful girl in the world!

00:44:53.980 --> 00:44:57.233
But I’m not the judges,
and I’m not all of Dalisay High!

00:44:57.909 --> 00:45:00.491
And I also don’t know
what you want me to say to Norwin.

00:45:02.376 --> 00:45:03.638
But answer me this,

00:45:03.832 --> 00:45:05.844
why did you even
volunteer for this pageant?

00:45:07.209 --> 00:45:08.209
Are you jealous?

00:45:08.329 --> 00:45:10.873
Or are you afraid I might develop
feelings for other candidates?

00:45:11.205 --> 00:45:13.184
Damn it, Luna!
I’m not like that!

00:45:19.208 --> 00:45:20.954
But if you’re not comfortable,

00:45:23.219 --> 00:45:24.219
fine,

00:45:24.316 --> 00:45:26.076
- I’ll just back out of the pageant.
- Don't.

00:45:28.916 --> 00:45:29.916
Don't.

00:45:31.428 --> 00:45:33.068
You were right about everything you said.

00:45:42.786 --> 00:45:43.912
Okay, class.

00:45:44.133 --> 00:45:47.053
Since Miss Cabigting
backed out of the pageant,

00:45:47.184 --> 00:45:51.183
she will be replaced
by none other than Miss Bengco!

00:45:59.821 --> 00:46:00.821
Luna!

00:46:07.454 --> 00:46:08.454
Can I come in?

00:46:10.618 --> 00:46:12.536
Luna, wait! Let’s just talk, please!

00:46:12.668 --> 00:46:13.769
Luna, wait!

00:46:13.794 --> 00:46:16.043
Just wait a second!
The door’s locked!

00:46:16.903 --> 00:46:18.178
Come on! Come in already!

00:46:18.840 --> 00:46:19.840
Come in!

00:46:25.634 --> 00:46:26.635
Let's break up.

00:46:30.686 --> 00:46:31.686
Why?

00:46:36.189 --> 00:46:38.483
Luna, I demand you to tell me why!

00:46:39.176 --> 00:46:40.176
Answer me!

00:46:43.694 --> 00:46:44.694
Congrats.

00:46:45.502 --> 00:46:46.782
So you’ve learned how to demand.

00:46:47.801 --> 00:46:49.359
You now know what you deserve.

00:46:51.398 --> 00:46:52.398
But why?

00:46:52.605 --> 00:46:53.848
Did I do something?

00:46:54.908 --> 00:46:56.104
Is this about Norwin?

00:47:03.371 --> 00:47:05.623
Before us, I was fine on my own.

00:47:07.890 --> 00:47:09.100
But now look,

00:47:10.110 --> 00:47:12.070
I’m like a leech clinging
to you all the time.

00:47:14.697 --> 00:47:17.617
That’s the kind of person
I became since we got together.

00:47:19.495 --> 00:47:20.996
I don’t think I like it anymore.

00:47:22.045 --> 00:47:24.047
Do you want us to just
go back to being low-key?

00:47:24.909 --> 00:47:25.909
That’s fine with me.

00:47:26.690 --> 00:47:28.567
But you’re not okay with that.

00:47:29.158 --> 00:47:32.653
It’s obvious in you. You were happier
when we went public.

00:47:34.398 --> 00:47:36.650
But I’m the one struggling.

00:47:37.623 --> 00:47:39.125
I keep thinking.

00:47:39.775 --> 00:47:42.153
Am I doing enough as your girlfriend?

00:47:42.577 --> 00:47:44.037
Am I right? Am I lacking?

00:47:45.886 --> 00:47:47.387
I’m becoming toxic.

00:47:47.981 --> 00:47:50.817
Gross. I don’t want this anymore!
I don’t want this.

00:47:54.453 --> 00:47:55.453
So that’s it?

00:47:58.284 --> 00:47:59.284
What about me?

00:48:00.275 --> 00:48:01.275
There!

00:48:02.194 --> 00:48:03.194
That’s right.

00:48:03.904 --> 00:48:05.072
Think about yourself.

00:48:06.323 --> 00:48:07.323
What about you?

00:48:09.524 --> 00:48:10.900
But I can’t answer that.

00:48:12.899 --> 00:48:15.443
Because I don’t even know
what to do with myself.

00:48:17.013 --> 00:48:18.623
I love you so much.

00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:29.764
So the next time you get a girlfriend,

00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:33.177
don’t choose someone crazy like me, okay?

00:48:36.279 --> 00:48:38.323
And don’t settle for scraps.

00:48:39.775 --> 00:48:42.069
Because you deserve more than that.

00:48:44.594 --> 00:48:47.305
Honestly, I don’t deserve your love.

00:48:49.562 --> 00:48:50.563
It’s too...

00:48:51.676 --> 00:48:53.011
Too pure.

00:49:00.227 --> 00:49:01.895
You deserve love, Luna.

00:49:03.522 --> 00:49:04.523
Remember that.

00:49:08.181 --> 00:49:11.142
I hope someday I
can say that to myself.

00:49:30.488 --> 00:49:32.281
It’s really over, Sir Dan.

00:49:32.451 --> 00:49:35.912
We haven’t spoken
since we broke up.

00:49:36.455 --> 00:49:37.471
Why?

00:49:37.509 --> 00:49:39.029
Are you two fighting?

00:49:39.434 --> 00:49:40.659
Not really.

00:49:41.344 --> 00:49:42.636
But it feels like

00:49:42.744 --> 00:49:44.213
it’s for the best.

00:49:44.408 --> 00:49:45.576
Because...

00:49:46.489 --> 00:49:47.949
if we start talking again,

00:49:48.175 --> 00:49:49.916
our feelings might come back

00:49:50.487 --> 00:49:53.323
and we’ll return to
the same problems.

00:49:54.325 --> 00:49:55.493
Whatever those were.

00:49:57.476 --> 00:49:59.960
You don’t know what
the problem was?

00:50:01.679 --> 00:50:03.602
To be honest, I don’t.

00:50:04.566 --> 00:50:06.187
I got tired of thinking about it.

00:50:06.676 --> 00:50:09.568
It is what it is, I guess.

00:50:13.817 --> 00:50:15.135
Murillo!

00:50:15.226 --> 00:50:16.226
Idiot.

00:50:16.620 --> 00:50:17.620
Sorry, sir.

00:50:18.038 --> 00:50:19.038
Hey Raffy,

00:50:19.484 --> 00:50:21.027
isn’t the pageant coming up soon?

00:50:21.421 --> 00:50:23.590
Aren’t you going
to diet, or work out?

00:50:25.642 --> 00:50:27.143
I just want it to be over.

00:50:27.610 --> 00:50:28.819
I don’t care if...

00:50:29.621 --> 00:50:30.830
if I win or lose anymore.

00:50:33.230 --> 00:50:35.497
- Ow!
- Hey, Raffy!

00:50:35.915 --> 00:50:37.375
Get your act together.

00:50:37.788 --> 00:50:39.206
Always remember,

00:50:39.558 --> 00:50:41.596
in everything you take on in life,

00:50:41.693 --> 00:50:44.362
you should always give 100 percent.

00:50:44.677 --> 00:50:47.918
Not join something
only to lose heart now.

00:50:48.029 --> 00:50:49.029
What’s that?

00:50:49.144 --> 00:50:51.420
I’m really not going to win, Sir Dan.

00:50:51.738 --> 00:50:52.738
Promise!

00:50:52.896 --> 00:50:55.482
By contestant number two,
I’ve already lost.

00:50:55.557 --> 00:50:58.414
He’s got eight-pack abs.
Look at me!

00:50:58.832 --> 00:51:00.708
And he’s really good
at answering questions.

00:51:00.733 --> 00:51:02.944
His talent is flipping like Carlos Yulo.

00:51:03.522 --> 00:51:07.360
You know what’s more important
than winning, Raffy?

00:51:07.754 --> 00:51:12.771
It’s the kind of person you become
in the process of achieving success.

00:51:24.143 --> 00:51:25.946
Hey guys, I'm so sorry.

00:51:25.971 --> 00:51:30.475
And now, the candidates for Lakan
and Lakambini of Dalisay High!

00:52:09.524 --> 00:52:13.936
Good evening, wonderful people
of Don Anselmo Dalisay High School!

00:52:13.961 --> 00:52:17.674
I am the Lakan representing
Grade 11-Alitaptap—

00:52:17.699 --> 00:52:20.657
Rafael Xavier A. Murillo!

00:52:30.045 --> 00:52:31.476
Candidate number one….

00:52:31.755 --> 00:52:36.842
If there is one important lesson
you have learned from joining this pageant,

00:52:36.843 --> 00:52:39.511
which you would like to share
with your fellow students...

00:52:39.536 --> 00:52:42.205
what would it be?
You have 30 seconds.

00:52:43.033 --> 00:52:45.382
Thank you for that meaningful question.

00:52:46.561 --> 00:52:49.196
The lesson I would like
to share with everyone is,

00:52:50.203 --> 00:52:52.622
in the process of
reaching our dreams,

00:52:52.929 --> 00:52:55.426
who we become along the journey

00:52:55.587 --> 00:52:58.465
is more important than
whether we win or not.

00:52:58.615 --> 00:53:00.992
Yes, I gave this pageant my all.

00:53:01.162 --> 00:53:03.264
But what I’ve become on this voyage—

00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:07.140
a more courageous man,
a more responsible student,

00:53:07.619 --> 00:53:09.684
and a persevering person…

00:53:09.809 --> 00:53:12.399
matters more than any title.

00:53:44.452 --> 00:53:47.013
Class! Class!

00:53:48.296 --> 00:53:52.172
Just one more school year
and you’ll graduate senior high.

00:53:54.251 --> 00:53:55.688
Okay, do your best, alright?

00:53:55.713 --> 00:53:58.184
College is a different battleground.

00:54:00.437 --> 00:54:02.362
Okay, you guys can have your break.

00:54:02.387 --> 00:54:03.638
Go on, eat lunch!

00:54:06.352 --> 00:54:10.208
Excuse me, ma’am. Miss Principal
is calling for Raffy Murillo.

00:54:12.492 --> 00:54:14.349
Take that off.
Move it over there.

00:54:14.858 --> 00:54:20.732
This summer, we are going to construct
a bust of our founder here in the school.

00:54:23.342 --> 00:54:24.802
Why did you call for me, ma'am?

00:54:25.694 --> 00:54:28.682
Well, one of the school
guards told me that

00:54:28.707 --> 00:54:33.059
you’ve been taking care of the
flowers here as if they were your own.

00:54:33.830 --> 00:54:35.248
I’d like to thank you for that.

00:54:36.485 --> 00:54:39.499
As a token of my appreciation,

00:54:39.615 --> 00:54:43.436
I would like to help you relocate
some of the flowers to your home.

00:54:43.553 --> 00:54:44.958
But only if you want.

00:54:46.830 --> 00:54:49.374
Some, okay. Just some. Not all.

00:54:51.856 --> 00:54:52.959
Let me help you.

00:55:07.945 --> 00:55:09.946
If you have something to say,
just say it.

00:55:09.995 --> 00:55:12.581
You keep sneaking glances,
you’ll get a stye.

00:55:17.517 --> 00:55:19.034
I want us to get back together.

00:55:25.160 --> 00:55:26.160
Raffy...

00:55:27.173 --> 00:55:29.489
This is probably the last
time we’ll see each other.

00:55:31.183 --> 00:55:32.838
Huh? Why?

00:55:33.420 --> 00:55:36.360
I’m stopping school for now.
My mom and I don’t have enough funds.

00:55:36.779 --> 00:55:39.401
I’ll help you, we’ll do
fundraising again. Like before!

00:55:43.603 --> 00:55:44.603
No need.

00:55:44.962 --> 00:55:46.555
No, seriously, Luna!

00:55:47.001 --> 00:55:48.001
I got you!

00:55:48.279 --> 00:55:49.858
I’ll borrow from Kris.

00:55:57.358 --> 00:55:59.526
Raffy, I’m not your responsibility.

00:56:01.141 --> 00:56:03.101
Besides, money isn’t the only problem.

00:56:03.632 --> 00:56:05.633
I’ve decided to follow
my mom to the province.

00:56:05.658 --> 00:56:08.369
I heard her boyfriend there has been
hurting her, she needs me.

00:56:14.750 --> 00:56:15.750
So...

00:56:16.462 --> 00:56:18.005
do well next school year, okay?

00:56:19.138 --> 00:56:20.138
And...

00:56:20.995 --> 00:56:22.365
prepare your speech.

00:56:23.070 --> 00:56:26.281
For sure, you’ll have a farewell walk
at the next Lakan and Lakambini.

00:56:41.469 --> 00:56:44.351
If you allow me to be your
student council president,

00:56:44.405 --> 00:56:49.523
I will fight for safe spaces where we can
talk about our mental health without shame.

00:56:50.425 --> 00:56:52.991
And I will push for a support system

00:56:53.122 --> 00:56:55.285
that not only lectures,

00:56:55.315 --> 00:56:56.631
but listens.

00:57:02.540 --> 00:57:05.068
I’ll take care of this.
Just handle the photocopies.

00:57:05.093 --> 00:57:06.374
Oh, okay. Okay.

00:57:09.282 --> 00:57:10.282
That’s all, sir?

00:57:10.366 --> 00:57:11.366
Just eight copies.

00:57:11.492 --> 00:57:12.492
Eight?

00:57:13.872 --> 00:57:15.395
Let’s go, touch the line, guys!

00:57:15.580 --> 00:57:16.789
Touch the line, guys!

00:57:19.691 --> 00:57:20.915
Let's go!

00:57:25.214 --> 00:57:27.609
Ma'am, is our order ready? Please toast it.

00:57:27.634 --> 00:57:31.195
Reminder, everyone,
right minus wrong.

00:57:31.220 --> 00:57:35.408
If you are caught cheating,
you will be expelled.

00:57:35.539 --> 00:57:36.645
That was fast!

00:57:39.764 --> 00:57:41.018
Quiet!

00:58:00.124 --> 00:58:03.921

00:58:03.946 --> 00:58:06.254

Calling the attention of
the following students,

00:58:37.188 --> 00:58:40.024
when your name is called, come forward.

00:58:40.523 --> 00:58:44.826
Amoroso. Bengco. Bocton. Foronda.

00:58:44.966 --> 00:58:49.440
Galura. Guidote. Ignacio. Labrador.

00:58:49.465 --> 00:58:54.628
Magbag. Montefalco. Murillo. And Tinio.

00:58:57.501 --> 00:58:59.294
Ahh. Why, ma’am?

00:58:59.461 --> 00:59:04.476
In your batch, only you twelve…

00:59:05.023 --> 00:59:07.377
Passed the exam for PRU!

00:59:07.402 --> 00:59:11.379
One of the most prestigious
colleges in the Philippines!

00:59:11.404 --> 00:59:14.657
Congratulations!

00:59:16.826 --> 00:59:18.077
Damn you!

00:59:18.494 --> 00:59:19.746
I have nothing, Jimboy.

00:59:19.771 --> 00:59:20.997
Nothing.

00:59:21.159 --> 00:59:23.099
Ah, but you can
afford a pedicure?

00:59:23.166 --> 00:59:25.375
I bragged to my friends
that I’d treat them,

00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:26.501
and now you're saying
you have nothing?

00:59:26.681 --> 00:59:27.880
You're going to embarrass me?

00:59:28.713 --> 00:59:32.197
I’ll find a way. I'll borrow money.

00:59:32.467 --> 00:59:34.077
Damn you!

00:59:35.988 --> 00:59:37.196
Damn you!

00:59:37.221 --> 00:59:39.260
I’ll call the cops
if you don’t stop.

00:59:40.245 --> 00:59:41.245
You too!

00:59:41.584 --> 00:59:43.253
You’ve been freeloading here for so long.

00:59:43.532 --> 00:59:44.575
You contribute nothing!

00:59:48.524 --> 00:59:50.755
That's my whole salary this month,
that should shut you up.

00:59:52.754 --> 00:59:54.756
Clean the bathroom
before you go to sleep!

01:00:06.851 --> 01:00:08.596
Why did you even come along?

01:00:10.063 --> 01:00:12.722
You should’ve just
stayed with your aunt.

01:00:13.328 --> 01:00:15.837
If I weren’t here, you might’ve
ended up a dead already.

01:00:18.455 --> 01:00:19.789
Let's go.

01:00:19.814 --> 01:00:23.299

01:00:23.434 --> 01:00:27.371

Bry, I’m already
at the boarding house.

01:01:03.099 --> 01:01:06.619
Okay, if you need anything,
just call, alright?

01:01:07.417 --> 01:01:08.835
Did you leave anything here?

01:01:09.105 --> 01:01:10.665
No, I brought everything.

01:01:27.127 --> 01:01:28.377
Baby, kill that monster, will you?

01:01:28.402 --> 01:01:31.947
- It annoys me!
- For you babe, we'll kill it.

01:01:32.003 --> 01:01:34.247
You're so good, baby!

01:01:34.881 --> 01:01:36.924
Not even a kiss?

01:01:37.508 --> 01:01:38.843
A kiss right away?

01:01:39.218 --> 01:01:42.136
See I won, don't I
deserve a reward?

01:01:42.263 --> 01:01:43.598
Alright.

01:01:43.890 --> 01:01:45.692
Here on the other side too.

01:01:46.475 --> 01:01:48.143
You are demanding.

01:01:48.168 --> 01:01:50.295
You're so stingy,
just on the lips.

01:01:50.771 --> 01:01:51.960
Wow!

01:01:54.068 --> 01:01:55.453
- Hello?
- Luna?

01:01:57.019 --> 01:01:58.046
Who’s this?

01:01:58.226 --> 01:02:01.061
Wow, you deleted my number.

01:02:01.245 --> 01:02:02.412
It’s Raffy.

01:02:03.726 --> 01:02:04.769
Raffy?

01:02:06.215 --> 01:02:08.901
Ah, Raffy.

01:02:09.293 --> 01:02:10.502
What made you call?

01:02:14.306 --> 01:02:15.306
Hello?

01:02:19.934 --> 01:02:21.009
I miss you.

01:02:21.510 --> 01:02:22.510
I think.

01:02:27.767 --> 01:02:28.767
Balut!

01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:31.519
Sir, balut, sir. Balut!

01:02:33.314 --> 01:02:34.444
Balut!

01:02:34.774 --> 01:02:36.025
Sis, balut, sis!

01:02:51.749 --> 01:02:56.401
Sis, he’s here now.

01:02:58.339 --> 01:03:00.493
Okay, okay, let him in.

01:03:01.130 --> 01:03:03.505
Hello, does Luna work here?

01:03:04.426 --> 01:03:05.468
Luna!

01:03:07.181 --> 01:03:08.224
Ah,

01:03:08.388 --> 01:03:09.681
Raffy.

01:03:10.315 --> 01:03:11.730
You found the address.

01:03:12.334 --> 01:03:13.585
It's quite far, right?

01:03:14.105 --> 01:03:15.462
Long time no see.

01:03:16.649 --> 01:03:17.968
I know right?

01:03:18.526 --> 01:03:19.768
One year.

01:03:20.987 --> 01:03:21.987
One year.

01:03:23.624 --> 01:03:25.042
Ah, I brought this for you.

01:03:25.403 --> 01:03:26.444
Oh my gosh.

01:03:26.469 --> 01:03:27.629
You went through the trouble.

01:03:27.882 --> 01:03:30.050
Are you really just staying
behind the counter, sis?

01:03:30.247 --> 01:03:32.764
Take good care of your guest.

01:03:33.008 --> 01:03:34.676
He came all the way from Manila.

01:03:47.802 --> 01:03:48.803
Thank you.

01:03:51.058 --> 01:03:52.058
How are you?

01:03:54.020 --> 01:03:55.020
Um...

01:03:56.355 --> 01:03:57.377
Hmm—

01:03:57.402 --> 01:03:58.987
Oh, this is Nash, by the way.

01:03:59.608 --> 01:04:00.719
Hi, Nash.

01:04:01.111 --> 01:04:02.111
Nice name.

01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:04.487
Short for NashMa.

01:04:04.830 --> 01:04:06.498
Assalamualaikum.

01:04:09.512 --> 01:04:10.513
Go ahead.

01:04:11.329 --> 01:04:13.431
Go! I’ll take care of closing up.

01:04:13.456 --> 01:04:16.732
- Are you sure?
- Yes, absolutely sure.

01:04:30.683 --> 01:04:32.385
Ah, miss, bill please.

01:04:32.612 --> 01:04:33.743
I got it, I got it.

01:04:33.828 --> 01:04:35.212
Come on. I’ll do it.

01:04:35.237 --> 01:04:36.268
You’re the guest.

01:04:36.293 --> 01:04:37.627
You still have a long trip home.

01:04:39.699 --> 01:04:40.708
How much is it?

01:04:40.733 --> 01:04:42.443
One hundred fifty only.

01:04:48.924 --> 01:04:51.095
It’s okay. Don’t worry.

01:04:51.458 --> 01:04:52.918
I’m earning.

01:04:53.171 --> 01:04:56.545
I do live selling gigs when I’m
in the mood to face the camera.

01:04:57.833 --> 01:04:59.168
Thank you.

01:05:00.731 --> 01:05:02.066
Um...

01:05:03.047 --> 01:05:05.014
School starts in a month, right?

01:05:05.174 --> 01:05:06.374
What course are you taking up?

01:05:06.717 --> 01:05:07.767
Botany.

01:05:09.293 --> 01:05:11.564
You really can’t let
go of plants, huh?

01:05:12.139 --> 01:05:13.797
You really know me, don’t you?

01:05:13.992 --> 01:05:15.875
Good thing I got accepted there.

01:05:15.946 --> 01:05:18.961
Because my second choice
was accountancy,

01:05:18.986 --> 01:05:21.696
and I just couldn’t imagine
myself in that kind of course.

01:05:21.721 --> 01:05:25.973
At least, right, what you’ll study
is really close to your heart.

01:05:30.487 --> 01:05:35.841
But seriously, Luna, thank you.

01:05:36.270 --> 01:05:40.568
If it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t have
achieved a lot in high school.

01:05:40.663 --> 01:05:43.015
You taught me to be assertive,

01:05:43.706 --> 01:05:47.969
to believe that I deserve to be
seen and reach greater heights.

01:05:52.538 --> 01:05:53.538
Hey, come on now.

01:05:53.687 --> 01:05:54.809
It’s 7:30 already.

01:05:55.244 --> 01:05:57.133
The last trip to Manila is at 8.

01:05:57.560 --> 01:05:59.252
Come on, I’ll take you to the bus station.

01:06:01.731 --> 01:06:02.815
Luna, wait!

01:06:02.948 --> 01:06:05.179
- Let’s go!
- Wait a sec, Luna!

01:06:06.303 --> 01:06:07.850
What? Let’s go!

01:06:10.532 --> 01:06:12.117
I wanna be with you longer.

01:06:16.308 --> 01:06:17.630
But it’s already late!

01:06:17.921 --> 01:06:19.506
I’ll just sleep over at your place.

01:06:19.827 --> 01:06:20.829
Huh?

01:06:20.881 --> 01:06:22.269
Where exactly?
It’s so cramped there.

01:06:22.294 --> 01:06:23.670
I only sleep in the living room.

01:06:23.711 --> 01:06:25.105
Then I’ll sleep in the living room too.

01:06:25.212 --> 01:06:26.217
No way.

01:06:26.242 --> 01:06:27.576
Don’t you want us to be together?

01:06:28.801 --> 01:06:31.804
I'm not gonna do anything
you wouldn't consent to.

01:06:32.138 --> 01:06:33.473
You just don’t understand.

01:06:33.498 --> 01:06:34.660
Understand what?

01:06:34.911 --> 01:06:35.911
Tell me.

01:06:38.735 --> 01:06:43.472
I read your messages, and they even saw you
at the church. What were you doing there?

01:06:43.497 --> 01:06:45.815
Of course! I listened to
them, they showed me.

01:06:45.816 --> 01:06:46.917
They have proof?

01:06:46.942 --> 01:06:48.210
- Yes, they showed—
- Nothing, nothing.

01:06:48.235 --> 01:06:49.945
What do you mean nothing?
Why are you lying to me?

01:06:49.970 --> 01:06:52.781
- You’re going crazy again.
- Huh? I’m not crazy.

01:06:52.782 --> 01:06:54.276
- I’m not lying!
- Do you understand now?

01:06:54.301 --> 01:06:55.318
Nothing!

01:06:55.343 --> 01:06:57.259
Do what you want!
You’re going crazy!

01:06:57.284 --> 01:06:58.662
- There's nothing!
- Whatever, piss off!

01:06:58.662 --> 01:06:59.685
- Wait a second!
- What do you want?

01:06:59.710 --> 01:07:01.183
I’m still talking to you,
what’s wrong with you?

01:07:01.207 --> 01:07:02.476
It's not my fault
women are drawn to me,

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:03.560
there’s nothing you can do about it!

01:07:03.584 --> 01:07:05.228
Then you should’ve
brought them here instead.

01:07:05.252 --> 01:07:06.919
What am I to you, really?

01:07:06.944 --> 01:07:08.653
A nanny? A maid, what?

01:07:08.678 --> 01:07:09.905
You know what, you should be grateful.

01:07:09.930 --> 01:07:12.588
If it weren’t for me,
no one would even want you!

01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:14.737
Damn you!

01:07:14.762 --> 01:07:17.071
Hey! Hey! That’s enough!

01:07:18.448 --> 01:07:19.758
- What the hell?
- Damn it. Who are you?

01:07:19.783 --> 01:07:21.785
- A friend of Luna, why?
- Let me go!

01:07:21.919 --> 01:07:24.047
You’re a grown man, physically able!

01:07:24.072 --> 01:07:25.949
And you dare hurt a woman?

01:07:26.148 --> 01:07:27.148
Coward!

01:07:28.457 --> 01:07:30.250
How about I bash your head in?

01:07:36.461 --> 01:07:37.504
Come on, sir.

01:07:38.224 --> 01:07:40.593
Even if I just pay for half the seats.

01:07:40.783 --> 01:07:42.304
It’s only almost midnight, sir.

01:07:42.448 --> 01:07:43.846
The first trip is at 4:30.

01:07:48.240 --> 01:07:49.240
Alright, sir.

01:07:49.418 --> 01:07:51.768
You can board while
waiting if you’d like.

01:07:51.799 --> 01:07:53.375
So you can also lie down.

01:07:53.424 --> 01:07:55.080
Okay. Thank you.

01:07:57.951 --> 01:08:00.662
Jimboy is really a good person.

01:08:01.917 --> 01:08:03.461
Just short-tempered.

01:08:03.947 --> 01:08:07.659
Maybe he got it from his father
who was in the military.

01:08:08.693 --> 01:08:11.905
But auntie, that’s no
excuse to hurt people.

01:08:15.406 --> 01:08:20.661
In my situation, son,
as a single mother,

01:08:21.725 --> 01:08:22.725
older now,

01:08:23.156 --> 01:08:25.778
I don’t have the right to
be picky about a partner.

01:08:26.242 --> 01:08:27.242
Do you—

01:08:29.671 --> 01:08:31.577
Did you even hear yourself, auntie?

01:08:32.131 --> 01:08:33.131
What about Luna?

01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:37.835
Don’t you think about how
she’s affected by your stupid decisions?

01:08:38.443 --> 01:08:41.070
You’re so selfish and irresponsible.

01:08:53.468 --> 01:08:54.469
Auntie!

01:08:55.421 --> 01:08:56.421
Auntie!

01:08:56.665 --> 01:08:58.709
You can't keep walking
away from this, Auntie!

01:08:59.383 --> 01:09:00.653
Luna is so talented,

01:09:00.678 --> 01:09:02.929
but her potential is being wasted
because of what you’ve been doing.

01:09:02.954 --> 01:09:07.181
You don’t know what I went through
to raise Luna on my own!

01:09:08.404 --> 01:09:10.747
If you want, go marry her,

01:09:10.772 --> 01:09:13.064
then you take care of her, since
you act like such a know-it-all!

01:09:13.089 --> 01:09:17.064
If only I could, auntie, but Luna herself
insists on staying close to you.

01:09:17.610 --> 01:09:20.691
Even if she’s so fed
up with your madness,

01:09:20.716 --> 01:09:23.123
you’re still her mother
and she loves you.

01:09:23.148 --> 01:09:26.568
As your only child, she chooses
to endure your nonsense with you.

01:09:26.860 --> 01:09:28.329
Hoping that you wake up!

01:09:28.354 --> 01:09:29.688
Raffy, that’s enough.

01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:35.127
She needs to hear this.

01:09:35.152 --> 01:09:36.611
You’re not in the position.

01:09:36.636 --> 01:09:38.409
You don’t deserve
to be treated like this.

01:09:38.434 --> 01:09:40.754
Please, don’t interfere.

01:09:40.779 --> 01:09:42.134
He’s right, my child.

01:09:46.505 --> 01:09:48.961
I haven't been a good mother.

01:09:50.870 --> 01:09:54.820
Maybe if you had a different mother,

01:09:57.563 --> 01:09:59.731
you would’ve gone so far already.

01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:07.459
Can you forgive me, my child?

01:10:45.405 --> 01:10:47.741
Raffy, come eat here.

01:10:47.766 --> 01:10:48.928
I’ll cook.

01:10:49.451 --> 01:10:50.578
Ah, no need, auntie.

01:10:50.603 --> 01:10:52.146
I need to go back to Manila.

01:10:52.615 --> 01:10:55.242
Anyway, you’re always welcome here.

01:10:55.828 --> 01:10:58.252
Just visit whenever you like.

01:10:59.129 --> 01:11:00.129
Alright.

01:11:10.938 --> 01:11:12.773
Thanks for meddling.

01:11:13.667 --> 01:11:14.669
Oh no!

01:11:14.759 --> 01:11:16.678
I left the anthurium at Jimboy's place.

01:11:17.250 --> 01:11:18.250
Just let it be.

01:11:18.501 --> 01:11:22.463
Anyway, if you need help, or
someone to talk to, just call.

01:11:25.820 --> 01:11:26.820
Take care.

01:11:29.434 --> 01:11:31.181
Take care. Bye.

01:11:33.061 --> 01:11:34.146
Bye.

01:11:37.324 --> 01:11:38.534
I’ll head inside now.

01:11:39.651 --> 01:11:40.651
Okay.

01:11:56.794 --> 01:11:57.836
Raffy!

01:12:40.546 --> 01:12:41.546
I’ll do that, ma.

01:12:41.922 --> 01:12:43.562
I’ll just call you
when it’s time to eat.

01:12:45.551 --> 01:12:46.551
Ma?

01:12:55.003 --> 01:12:58.172
Do you know why I broke up
with your dad?

01:13:00.607 --> 01:13:02.109
It felt like...

01:13:04.153 --> 01:13:06.363
I didn’t deserve him.

01:13:07.781 --> 01:13:09.616
I was just... ordinary.

01:13:13.162 --> 01:13:14.371
A waitress.

01:13:15.622 --> 01:13:17.040
From a broken family.

01:13:17.875 --> 01:13:19.960
I never finished school.

01:13:24.423 --> 01:13:26.466
You told me before he had another woman.

01:13:28.260 --> 01:13:29.261
Yes.

01:13:30.429 --> 01:13:34.224
That was the woman his
parents wanted for him.

01:13:35.058 --> 01:13:39.396
So, he had no choice but to follow.

01:13:41.481 --> 01:13:44.943
He didn’t even know I was pregnant.

01:13:49.364 --> 01:13:51.033
He didn’t know he had a child with you.

01:13:51.950 --> 01:13:52.950
Is that it, ma?

01:13:56.125 --> 01:13:58.336
There's always a brief nowadays.

01:13:58.587 --> 01:13:59.587
Ecoluxury.

01:13:59.612 --> 01:14:01.602
Agri-integrated spaces.

01:14:01.919 --> 01:14:03.045
Urban farms.

01:14:03.569 --> 01:14:04.927
Rooftop gardening.

01:14:05.255 --> 01:14:06.435
Vertical planting.

01:14:06.883 --> 01:14:08.092
Even condos now.

01:14:08.462 --> 01:14:10.047
They want edible landscapes.

01:14:10.268 --> 01:14:11.284
That’s right.

01:14:11.309 --> 01:14:14.604
Clients want their buildings to
look like they care about the climate.

01:14:14.827 --> 01:14:16.547
Even if they have three cars in the garage.

01:14:17.601 --> 01:14:19.434
- See you guys next week.
- See you.

01:14:20.697 --> 01:14:21.697
Vito.

01:14:29.237 --> 01:14:30.447
What are you doing here?

01:14:31.089 --> 01:14:32.674
My wife might see us.

01:14:33.992 --> 01:14:34.992
Dad!

01:14:40.907 --> 01:14:43.179
Why didn’t you tell me, Letty?

01:14:47.432 --> 01:14:51.853
You were already engaged to Gwen
when I found out I was pregnant.

01:14:53.321 --> 01:14:54.906
I didn’t want to cause a scene.

01:14:56.431 --> 01:14:58.433
So, why now?

01:15:02.462 --> 01:15:05.506
Why are you telling me
this after all these years?

01:15:05.531 --> 01:15:08.419
Because Luna deserves
to know her real father.

01:15:12.777 --> 01:15:14.445
You don’t have to do anything, dad.

01:15:15.415 --> 01:15:16.658
I’m not asking for anything.

01:15:20.279 --> 01:15:21.655
I just wanted to know you.

01:15:22.708 --> 01:15:24.126
To see you face to face.

01:15:24.626 --> 01:15:28.672
It’s enough for me
that you know I exist.

01:15:30.632 --> 01:15:31.633
Let’s go, Ma.

01:15:36.596 --> 01:15:37.596
Stop!

01:15:39.092 --> 01:15:40.579
Raffy!

01:15:40.604 --> 01:15:42.244
Dad will be the one
to send me to school.

01:15:42.269 --> 01:15:43.762
He’ll also give me a monthly allowance.

01:15:43.787 --> 01:15:45.789
And starting tomorrow...

01:15:45.814 --> 01:15:47.808
I’ll catch up with the
enrollment for grade 12.

01:15:47.833 --> 01:15:49.525
Really? At Dalisay High?

01:15:49.755 --> 01:15:50.755
Yes.

01:15:51.523 --> 01:15:53.823
A miracle.
You didn’t refuse your dad’s offer.

01:15:54.297 --> 01:15:55.757
Well, of course.

01:15:55.782 --> 01:15:58.367
Would I deny him the
chance to make up for it?

01:15:58.368 --> 01:16:00.124
I’d be so arrogant if I did, right?

01:16:00.287 --> 01:16:01.471
Well, that’s true.

01:16:01.528 --> 01:16:03.874
Luna, focus on your studies.

01:16:04.038 --> 01:16:06.307
Then apply here at PRU, okay?

01:16:06.332 --> 01:16:07.332
It’s good here.

01:16:08.545 --> 01:16:10.589
You just want to be
with me there, huh?

01:16:13.144 --> 01:16:15.271
Of course, that’s automatic.

01:16:16.970 --> 01:16:19.222
Hello, Luna. How’s school?

01:16:19.639 --> 01:16:21.390
There's so many readings.

01:16:21.391 --> 01:16:23.310
But it’s all good. I can handle it.

01:16:26.427 --> 01:16:28.012
You’re so motivated.

01:16:28.565 --> 01:16:31.151
It’s like I was given a
second chance at life.

01:16:31.568 --> 01:16:32.694
I won’t waste it.

01:16:35.322 --> 01:16:39.926
Welcome back, Luna!

01:16:39.951 --> 01:16:41.912
How about you, how are you there?

01:16:44.716 --> 01:16:46.432
I got a part-time job.

01:16:46.487 --> 01:16:47.798
Just for extra money.

01:16:48.602 --> 01:16:50.411
Why? You're running short on money?

01:16:50.457 --> 01:16:51.558
Not really.

01:16:51.630 --> 01:16:53.256
I just want to buy something.

01:16:54.074 --> 01:16:56.878
Hey, handsome.
I said no sweetener, right?

01:16:57.405 --> 01:16:59.262
Oh, sorry ma’am.
I’ll just replace it.

01:17:00.013 --> 01:17:01.306
I'm really sorry.

01:17:02.724 --> 01:17:05.435
You keep fiddling with your phone
while working.

01:17:07.497 --> 01:17:08.497
Luna!

01:17:08.522 --> 01:17:09.931
Luna, Luna, Luna!

01:17:09.956 --> 01:17:11.374
- What?
- Come here! Come here!

01:17:11.399 --> 01:17:13.165
Where?

01:17:13.193 --> 01:17:14.935
Here! Here!

01:17:15.835 --> 01:17:19.004
- Look! Look!
- What is it? What is it?

01:17:19.312 --> 01:17:21.606
Ma’am, someone’s here to pick you up.

01:17:25.197 --> 01:17:26.532
Wow.

01:17:29.768 --> 01:17:31.645
Don’t you have class on Friday?

01:17:32.292 --> 01:17:33.377
We had an early dismissal.

01:17:33.435 --> 01:17:35.273
That’s why I came straight here.

01:17:36.575 --> 01:17:37.737
Is that for me?

01:17:38.087 --> 01:17:41.587
Who else would I give
this to? No one, right?

01:17:42.389 --> 01:17:43.515
So annoying.

01:17:55.861 --> 01:17:57.556
This looks expensive, Raf.

01:17:58.338 --> 01:17:59.547
Just once in a while.

01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:01.240
Let’s eat.

01:18:07.164 --> 01:18:08.790
- Oh, by the way.
- Yes?

01:18:12.210 --> 01:18:13.837
I have a...

01:18:15.033 --> 01:18:16.659
Very big problem?

01:18:19.134 --> 01:18:20.134
Problem?

01:18:21.251 --> 01:18:22.251
What?

01:18:24.355 --> 01:18:25.732
Are we back together again?

01:18:28.602 --> 01:18:29.602
My God.

01:18:29.768 --> 01:18:31.168
I thought it was something serious.

01:18:31.688 --> 01:18:33.148
No, seriously.

01:18:36.095 --> 01:18:37.349
Isn't it obvious?

01:18:49.954 --> 01:18:50.973
What's wrong?

01:18:55.066 --> 01:18:56.149
I passed.

01:18:56.174 --> 01:18:57.301
At PRU?

01:18:57.438 --> 01:18:58.773
Yeah. Fine Arts.

01:18:58.798 --> 01:19:00.359
So, we’ll be at the same school next year?

01:19:00.550 --> 01:19:02.777
- Yes.
- Wow.

01:19:02.802 --> 01:19:04.721
- Congrats, Luna!
- Wow.

01:19:06.723 --> 01:19:08.599
I'm so proud of you.

01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:15.047
Up next, the salutatorian of the batch,
Maria Luna Poblete Cabigting.

01:19:28.411 --> 01:19:32.822
So, you're the boyfriend
of my daughter?

01:19:33.161 --> 01:19:34.161
Yes, sir.

01:19:37.087 --> 01:19:38.797
Should I be worried?

01:19:42.968 --> 01:19:44.010
About what, sir?

01:19:45.868 --> 01:19:49.794
Won’t you be a
distraction to her studies?

01:19:50.559 --> 01:19:52.185
Especially now that...

01:19:53.298 --> 01:19:55.634
you’ll both be entering
the same university.

01:19:56.329 --> 01:19:57.329
No, sir.

01:19:57.354 --> 01:19:59.684
I want us to prosper
together in life.

01:20:08.087 --> 01:20:09.797
For you, Luna.

01:20:12.795 --> 01:20:13.963
Are you serious?

01:20:14.916 --> 01:20:16.167
Congratulations.

01:20:18.534 --> 01:20:21.626
Thank you, Pa.
Thank you so much.

01:20:22.146 --> 01:20:26.849
I already bought you
a one-bedroom condo near PRU.

01:20:26.874 --> 01:20:28.584
150 square meters.

01:20:29.197 --> 01:20:31.032
Really? Wow, Pa, that's too much, Dad!

01:20:31.103 --> 01:20:34.190
I want you to have the perfect
environment when you're studying.

01:20:34.602 --> 01:20:37.014
And I don’t want you
just barely passing, okay?

01:20:37.039 --> 01:20:38.665
I want you to be successful.

01:20:38.690 --> 01:20:41.059
I want you to be the
best that you can be.

01:20:41.645 --> 01:20:43.839
- Okay?
- Yes, Pa. Promise.

01:20:43.864 --> 01:20:45.161
- Good.
- Promise.

01:20:46.409 --> 01:20:47.409
Good.

01:20:47.657 --> 01:20:48.657
Thank you, Pa.

01:20:59.669 --> 01:21:03.106
- Hello, hello!
- Raffy!

01:21:03.131 --> 01:21:04.571
Welcome!

01:21:05.415 --> 01:21:06.792
It’s beautiful!

01:21:06.843 --> 01:21:07.843
Right?

01:21:08.490 --> 01:21:09.967
Did you know? Oh, wait a sec.

01:21:09.992 --> 01:21:11.784
- Please leave your shoes by the door.
- Oh, sorry.

01:21:11.809 --> 01:21:12.809
It's okay!

01:21:13.595 --> 01:21:14.596
Right.

01:21:15.066 --> 01:21:16.186
Here’s my housewarming gift.

01:21:16.269 --> 01:21:19.456
Aw, thank you!

01:21:19.481 --> 01:21:21.124
It’s so nice!

01:21:21.238 --> 01:21:22.864
Please close the door.

01:21:22.889 --> 01:21:23.889
Oh, okay.

01:21:24.176 --> 01:21:25.594
Come on, over here.

01:21:29.908 --> 01:21:32.827
Wow, perfect!

01:21:33.787 --> 01:21:36.623
I’m excited, Raffy. Excited but nervous.

01:21:37.949 --> 01:21:39.616
- Hey! Careful, you might sit on that.
- I moved it.

01:21:40.005 --> 01:21:41.090
Ah, okay.

01:21:48.385 --> 01:21:49.385
Are you okay?

01:21:50.178 --> 01:21:51.178
Of course.

01:21:52.305 --> 01:21:54.935
Come on, hurry up.
Say it already.

01:21:57.568 --> 01:21:58.568
Well...

01:21:59.333 --> 01:22:01.877
when I found out you passed PRU,

01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:05.975
I just had this wishful thought that
you’d live at my boarding house.

01:22:06.272 --> 01:22:09.978
Not in the same room,
but you know, in the same building.

01:22:10.894 --> 01:22:12.099
Unless...

01:22:13.835 --> 01:22:15.294
You know, that would be nice.

01:22:16.295 --> 01:22:17.919
But, no.

01:22:17.997 --> 01:22:19.808
My dad got this condo.

01:22:28.216 --> 01:22:31.423
Hey, stop it!

01:22:31.553 --> 01:22:32.761
If you tear this up, I'm telling you!

01:22:32.786 --> 01:22:34.982
Stop bothering me, Raffy!

01:22:35.724 --> 01:22:37.902
You’re so messy! So annoying!

01:22:39.017 --> 01:22:40.633
Don’t!

01:22:41.656 --> 01:22:44.242
This baby’s so cute.

01:22:44.267 --> 01:22:45.586
Ready for school?

01:22:46.336 --> 01:22:47.378
You’re really so gross.

01:22:47.403 --> 01:22:49.504
Oh, is that so?
Is that so?

01:22:49.621 --> 01:22:51.029
- Gross?
- Gross!

01:22:52.719 --> 01:22:54.851
Don’t, Raffy!

01:22:54.965 --> 01:22:57.640
Don’t, Raffy!

01:23:14.004 --> 01:23:15.345
I love you.

01:23:19.631 --> 01:23:22.434
I’ll sleep over here,
would you like that?

01:23:23.808 --> 01:23:24.808
Hmm.

01:23:27.002 --> 01:23:28.002
Oh, come on!

01:23:28.027 --> 01:23:32.920
You know what, better help me
wrap these instead. Come on.

01:23:32.960 --> 01:23:33.974
Okay.

01:23:33.999 --> 01:23:40.147
M-theory suggests the
universe isn’t just strings—

01:23:42.202 --> 01:23:43.475
it’s branes.

01:23:43.915 --> 01:23:48.171
B-R-A-N-E-S, not brains like the mind.

01:23:48.265 --> 01:23:50.760
They’re multidimensional structures

01:23:51.029 --> 01:23:52.986
vibrating in a space

01:23:53.301 --> 01:23:56.254
- your senses were never built to grasp.
- Let's meet up. Grandstand, 5 PM.

01:23:56.766 --> 01:24:00.906
Now, who invented M-theory?

01:24:06.650 --> 01:24:07.650
Who?

01:24:09.130 --> 01:24:11.049
Ah, sorry ma’am,
what’s the question again?

01:24:11.159 --> 01:24:12.167
Anyone?

01:24:12.192 --> 01:24:13.192
Santiago?

01:24:13.217 --> 01:24:14.492
Physicist Witten, ma’am.

01:24:14.948 --> 01:24:15.948
Very good.

01:24:35.885 --> 01:24:39.507
Here in this group, we’re not looking
for who’s the best.

01:24:39.732 --> 01:24:41.609
Although of course,
that’s important too.

01:24:42.400 --> 01:24:43.912
We’re more interested

01:24:43.937 --> 01:24:47.343
in those who are good at what they do
and also want to say something to society.

01:24:47.555 --> 01:24:52.232
And willing to hone their talent to express
artistically what they want to say.

01:24:53.510 --> 01:24:55.638
Now, we want to see your art.

01:24:55.773 --> 01:24:58.107
I’m pretty sure all of you took
some photos of your artwork.

01:24:58.132 --> 01:25:00.134
So, don't be shy.

01:25:00.491 --> 01:25:01.658
Just show it to us.

01:25:03.967 --> 01:25:05.886
We’re not going to judge. Promise.

01:25:14.149 --> 01:25:16.442
Wow. Thank you, guys, for welcoming me.

01:25:16.467 --> 01:25:19.387
- Of course. You’re really good.
- Thank you.

01:25:19.412 --> 01:25:21.913
Wow. You’re all so welcoming.

01:25:21.991 --> 01:25:23.616
We can sense you’re a hard worker.

01:25:23.641 --> 01:25:25.058
Oh, correct!

01:25:25.389 --> 01:25:26.933
Thank you.

01:25:28.618 --> 01:25:31.246
Ah, um, I actually have to go now.

01:25:31.378 --> 01:25:34.586
See you around. Bye-bye.
Thank you. Thank you!

01:25:34.611 --> 01:25:35.611
Take care!

01:25:36.170 --> 01:25:37.338
Raffy, hi!

01:25:37.363 --> 01:25:39.416
Sorry, have you been waiting long?

01:25:40.950 --> 01:25:42.157
We agreed on 5 PM...

01:25:42.744 --> 01:25:43.911
It’s 6:30 already.

01:25:44.721 --> 01:25:47.224
I’m really sorry.

01:25:47.415 --> 01:25:48.895
I just had to take care of something.

01:25:49.466 --> 01:25:50.925
I’ve been texting you for a while.

01:25:50.950 --> 01:25:52.076
You could’ve called instead.

01:25:54.505 --> 01:25:55.505
Gosh.

01:25:57.191 --> 01:26:00.457
I’m really sorry,
I put my phone on silent.

01:26:02.540 --> 01:26:04.212
Hey, this is really nice.

01:26:04.435 --> 01:26:05.664
Is this for me?

01:26:07.451 --> 01:26:09.322
Mmm! Smells good!

01:26:09.347 --> 01:26:10.593
What do you want for dinner?

01:26:11.030 --> 01:26:12.541
It’s on me, to make it up to you.

01:26:16.959 --> 01:26:17.959
You’re so mad!

01:26:17.984 --> 01:26:18.984
Here, here.

01:26:24.702 --> 01:26:26.620
They have so many things lined up!

01:26:26.621 --> 01:26:28.372
There are weekly open studio nights,

01:26:28.373 --> 01:26:32.042
plus 3D modeling workshops,
and sometimes there’s even an exhibit

01:26:32.067 --> 01:26:34.944
where members can
showcase their own work.

01:26:36.898 --> 01:26:37.898
Nice.

01:26:39.676 --> 01:26:40.968
No reaction from you?

01:26:42.144 --> 01:26:43.144
Hmm?

01:26:43.721 --> 01:26:44.764
I said, it’s nice.

01:26:47.601 --> 01:26:48.920
It’s Tuesday today, right?

01:26:49.102 --> 01:26:50.901
Don’t you have a shift
at the coffee shop?

01:26:52.438 --> 01:26:53.731
I already resigned.

01:26:54.148 --> 01:26:55.148
Huh?

01:26:55.274 --> 01:26:56.274
Why?

01:26:56.646 --> 01:26:59.003
So I’ll have more time for us.

01:26:59.137 --> 01:27:00.304
But we still have weekends, Raf.

01:27:00.329 --> 01:27:02.623
We don’t need to be
together every single day.

01:27:05.098 --> 01:27:07.184
So you actually don’t want
to be with me every day?

01:27:12.576 --> 01:27:14.719
Just kidding!
I’m just kidding.

01:27:15.586 --> 01:27:17.949
I resigned so I could sleep longer.

01:27:19.590 --> 01:27:21.235
Let’s eat, give me your bowl.

01:27:52.290 --> 01:27:54.041
Sleep well. I love you.

01:28:25.239 --> 01:28:29.035
Geez, you totally ignored my chat.

01:28:47.092 --> 01:28:49.218
- This, it’s here.
- Okay.

01:28:49.347 --> 01:28:52.375
and then after, over here.

01:28:52.400 --> 01:28:54.109
Here, right here.

01:28:54.143 --> 01:28:56.209
- Which one? This?
- Yeah, that one.

01:28:56.234 --> 01:28:57.234
Oh, sorry.

01:28:57.894 --> 01:28:59.602
- Sorry, sorry.
- Like this?

01:28:59.627 --> 01:29:00.794
Yes, make it even.

01:29:00.819 --> 01:29:02.506
Oh, okay, okay.

01:29:03.323 --> 01:29:04.323
Okay.

01:29:06.816 --> 01:29:07.816
Luns!

01:29:07.918 --> 01:29:09.400
Someone sent you something.

01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:11.220
From whom?

01:29:11.536 --> 01:29:13.531
I didn’t ask. They were in a rush.

01:29:15.542 --> 01:29:16.752
Excuse me.

01:29:31.276 --> 01:29:34.405
See you when you're not busy.

01:29:40.618 --> 01:29:41.744
Good morning.

01:29:42.030 --> 01:29:43.448
Good morning.

01:29:46.580 --> 01:29:47.873
How are you feeling?

01:29:48.757 --> 01:29:51.426
My head still hurts.

01:29:55.944 --> 01:29:57.236
Maybe you got jinxed.

01:29:57.967 --> 01:29:59.860
That’s what happens when you
keep brushing up with everyone.

01:30:02.629 --> 01:30:09.011
But isn’t it true that when a baby
gets jinxed, they get to be tickled!

01:30:09.124 --> 01:30:10.899
- I'm the tickle monster!
- Don't!

01:30:10.924 --> 01:30:16.839
- I’ll put saliva on you!
- Don't!

01:30:17.310 --> 01:30:20.980
Wait! My head hurts so much,
I feel like I'm dying.

01:30:27.622 --> 01:30:28.622
Are you okay?

01:30:30.067 --> 01:30:31.067
No.

01:30:33.826 --> 01:30:35.508
You’re lacking my affection.

01:30:35.828 --> 01:30:37.413
That’s why you ran out of energy.

01:30:42.209 --> 01:30:44.921
So, where do you want
to go on a date later?

01:30:49.254 --> 01:30:51.780
I don’t think I can get up right now.

01:30:51.974 --> 01:30:52.974
Aw.

01:30:54.204 --> 01:30:55.204
Is that so?

01:30:55.653 --> 01:30:56.653
Yeah.

01:30:58.935 --> 01:31:00.353
What if?

01:31:09.737 --> 01:31:10.821
Hold on.

01:31:24.069 --> 01:31:25.487
We should do this more often.

01:31:27.908 --> 01:31:29.159
Just chill at home?

01:31:31.801 --> 01:31:33.719
No, like, cuddling.

01:31:34.387 --> 01:31:36.174
Just spending more time together.

01:31:37.515 --> 01:31:42.559
How I wish, but I have so many
things to do at school.

01:31:46.844 --> 01:31:48.194
How can I support you?

01:31:49.522 --> 01:31:53.264
If you want, I can do
the cleaning or cooking.

01:32:13.989 --> 01:32:15.691
You’re already a sure win here.

01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:16.760
Claim it.

01:32:17.179 --> 01:32:19.724
Oh stop it, there are so many
talented ones out there.

01:32:20.116 --> 01:32:21.159
But it’s true.

01:32:23.352 --> 01:32:24.352
Hey,

01:32:24.566 --> 01:32:26.285
you better go,
you still have class.

01:32:27.734 --> 01:32:30.779
I’ll just be absent,
it’s all reporting tasks anyway.

01:32:31.693 --> 01:32:33.092
If you get dropped...

01:32:35.960 --> 01:32:37.188
Wait, Raffy.

01:32:38.460 --> 01:32:39.460
Oh, of course.

01:32:39.485 --> 01:32:40.485
Oh, Luna!

01:32:41.072 --> 01:32:42.208
Sir, here she is.

01:32:42.234 --> 01:32:44.534
The woman that we've been
telling you great things about.

01:32:44.866 --> 01:32:47.140
Luna, meet Sir Forsyth-Greene,

01:32:47.446 --> 01:32:50.646
a professor from the Lysander
Arts Institute in California.

01:32:50.896 --> 01:32:52.565
Very honored to meet you, sir.

01:32:53.328 --> 01:32:54.413
You did that, huh?

01:32:56.343 --> 01:32:57.372
Yes, sir.

01:32:57.397 --> 01:33:02.923
Well, I do have a few nitpicks here and
there, but overall, it's pretty solid work.

01:33:03.337 --> 01:33:05.464
Let's hope my fellow
judges feel the same way.

01:33:09.142 --> 01:33:12.043
And now, the moment
you've all been waiting for.

01:33:13.513 --> 01:33:15.807
For its bold composition,

01:33:16.086 --> 01:33:17.837
emotional clarity,

01:33:18.268 --> 01:33:21.220
and innovative use of mixed media,

01:33:21.728 --> 01:33:26.843
the judges and I are proud
to award the championship to...

01:33:28.315 --> 01:33:29.733
Luna Cabigting!

01:33:29.767 --> 01:33:32.897
[cheering, applauding]

01:33:32.922 --> 01:33:34.722
- Go ahead, take it.
- Go on, you go in front.

01:33:34.747 --> 01:33:37.057
Thank you! Thank you!

01:33:37.873 --> 01:33:43.629
Wow! I would like to thank the board
of judges for recognizing my work.

01:33:43.654 --> 01:33:46.864
And of course, to be honest,
all the entries were outstanding.

01:33:46.889 --> 01:33:50.015
So, let's give them a round of applause.

01:33:50.064 --> 01:33:51.402
Yeah!

01:33:52.250 --> 01:33:55.797
And of course, I also
want to thank my org mates

01:33:55.822 --> 01:33:57.755
from PRU Samahang Sining!

01:33:57.780 --> 01:33:59.882
Yeah!

01:33:59.907 --> 01:34:01.177
You’re the best—

01:34:01.202 --> 01:34:02.987
because of your support and guidance,

01:34:03.012 --> 01:34:04.805
I couldn’t have made my
entry this way without you.

01:34:04.829 --> 01:34:06.321
So, thank you so much.

01:34:06.346 --> 01:34:07.902
You're super welcome.

01:34:08.558 --> 01:34:10.893
Come here, let's take a photo together.

01:34:10.918 --> 01:34:12.429
Hurry up.

01:34:14.287 --> 01:34:15.580
Come here.

01:34:18.465 --> 01:34:19.967
Once a Kasama,

01:34:19.992 --> 01:34:22.114
always a Kasama!

01:34:24.890 --> 01:34:26.739
- Congrats, Luns!
- Thank you!

01:34:26.764 --> 01:34:27.764
Congrats!

01:34:33.263 --> 01:34:34.263
Raffy!

01:34:36.135 --> 01:34:37.378
Raffy, look!

01:34:37.694 --> 01:34:39.446
I got all of my class cards.

01:34:39.471 --> 01:34:40.931
I'm on the Dean's List.

01:34:41.710 --> 01:34:42.710
Congrats!

01:34:42.908 --> 01:34:43.908
How about you?

01:34:45.119 --> 01:34:46.119
What about me?

01:34:46.829 --> 01:34:48.289
How are your grades?

01:34:57.291 --> 01:34:58.382
Hey, Luna!

01:34:58.515 --> 01:34:59.807
I’ll just take a look.

01:35:07.392 --> 01:35:08.643
What’s happening to you?

01:35:09.458 --> 01:35:11.961
You're barely passing, and you even
have two incompletes.

01:35:12.786 --> 01:35:15.251
It’s because I don’t
have a rich dad like you.

01:35:16.918 --> 01:35:17.918
What?

01:35:18.956 --> 01:35:19.956
Nothing.

01:35:21.296 --> 01:35:22.379
Say that again.

01:35:22.404 --> 01:35:23.404
I said, nothing.

01:35:28.392 --> 01:35:29.477
Hey, Luna!

01:35:30.986 --> 01:35:31.986
Luna, wait.

01:35:32.422 --> 01:35:33.840
Luna, wait!

01:35:34.515 --> 01:35:36.017
Luna, wait. I’m sorry.

01:35:36.295 --> 01:35:37.546
I'm sorry, okay?

01:35:37.724 --> 01:35:39.148
Let's talk, please.

01:35:39.173 --> 01:35:40.526
I don’t want to talk to you

01:35:40.551 --> 01:35:42.188
when you’re like this, worse
than someone on their period.

01:35:42.881 --> 01:35:44.007
I'm sorry.

01:35:44.032 --> 01:35:46.282
It's just that I'm afraid of losing you

01:35:46.307 --> 01:35:49.240
and as time goes by,
our time together is getting shorter.

01:35:49.426 --> 01:35:51.303
That should be fine, Raffy!

01:35:51.328 --> 01:35:53.204
I have a life and so should you!

01:35:53.229 --> 01:35:57.793
Our worlds don’t need to revolve around
each other, we’re too young for that!

01:36:02.321 --> 01:36:03.321
You’re my world!

01:36:04.573 --> 01:36:09.130
Raffy, if that means you’ll
sabotage yourself, I don’t want that.

01:36:11.789 --> 01:36:14.458
You’re discarding me
because I’m useless to you?

01:36:15.167 --> 01:36:16.167
Wow!

01:36:16.832 --> 01:36:18.375
That’s a harsh accusation!

01:36:19.284 --> 01:36:21.703
What are you implying?
I’m a narcissist, is that it?

01:36:22.329 --> 01:36:23.329
And you?

01:36:23.660 --> 01:36:28.628
You really want me stuck in life.
Struggling, lacking. For what?

01:36:28.653 --> 01:36:30.586
So you can act like my
knight in shining armor?

01:36:31.390 --> 01:36:32.849
Why would I do that?

01:36:32.874 --> 01:36:36.044
To make you feel good about yourself
because you’re so insecure!

01:36:41.360 --> 01:36:42.444
You know what?

01:36:43.616 --> 01:36:45.618
Let’s just take a
break from each other.

01:36:46.240 --> 01:36:48.060
Let’s think about our lives.

01:36:57.835 --> 01:37:05.133
♪ In my dream. We’re happily together ♪

01:37:05.134 --> 01:37:10.805
♪ You accept me. Even if I’m not perfect ♪

01:37:10.806 --> 01:37:19.939
♪ In the dream, all the
stars. Are aligned for us ♪

01:37:19.940 --> 01:37:23.943
♪ So I hope I don’t wake up. ♪

01:37:23.944 --> 01:37:33.037
♪ In a dream only. In a dream only ♪

01:37:41.776 --> 01:37:42.776
Hello?

01:37:44.798 --> 01:37:45.798
Where are you?

01:38:04.401 --> 01:38:05.401
I'm sorry.

01:38:07.809 --> 01:38:09.175
I hope you can forgive me.

01:38:13.177 --> 01:38:14.177
How are you?

01:38:14.661 --> 01:38:15.829
Have you enrolled yet?

01:38:19.083 --> 01:38:20.083
Not yet.

01:38:20.376 --> 01:38:21.643
Tomorrow’s the last day,

01:38:22.554 --> 01:38:23.696
want me to help you?

01:38:29.666 --> 01:38:30.667
Raffy...

01:38:32.304 --> 01:38:34.640
I talked to Dad last month.

01:38:35.342 --> 01:38:39.300
He offered me a slot at a prestigious
animation school in America.

01:38:39.794 --> 01:38:45.771
He’ll cover everything— tuition, airfare,
even living expenses until graduation.

01:38:52.003 --> 01:38:54.366
I won’t accept it if
you’re not comfortable.

01:38:55.670 --> 01:38:57.422
Why is it suddenly all up to me?

01:38:58.793 --> 01:39:02.922
Didn’t I tell you before, I don’t want to
be an obstacle to your dreams in life.

01:39:03.180 --> 01:39:04.639
If that's what you want, go.

01:39:05.462 --> 01:39:10.092
But if I accept it, you’ll
say I’m discarding you.

01:39:10.432 --> 01:39:12.744
That I have no consideration
for your feelings.

01:39:13.799 --> 01:39:16.510
What’s your honest opinion
about this situation?

01:39:26.332 --> 01:39:27.332
Honestly?

01:39:28.689 --> 01:39:32.459
I can't bear the thought
to be away from you for...

01:39:32.818 --> 01:39:34.736
Wait, hold on—how many years is it?

01:39:36.660 --> 01:39:38.222
- Four years.
- Four years!

01:39:38.411 --> 01:39:39.924
That’s a lot.

01:39:41.431 --> 01:39:44.745
If I'm going to be selfish, okay, fine.

01:39:44.851 --> 01:39:46.669
No. I don't want you to go.

01:39:46.770 --> 01:39:49.106
There are good animation schools here too.

01:39:51.464 --> 01:39:53.172
Alright, I won’t accept it anymore.

01:39:53.256 --> 01:39:55.424
Wait, that’s just my opinion.

01:39:56.705 --> 01:39:58.776
But you... what do you want?

01:39:59.141 --> 01:40:00.434
What does your heart tell you?

01:40:01.265 --> 01:40:04.977
I want to accept,
not at your expense.

01:40:06.779 --> 01:40:09.406
If I go through with it,
can you wait for me?

01:40:10.444 --> 01:40:11.987
That’s four years, Raffy.

01:40:15.230 --> 01:40:16.815
I'm willing to wait
if you are as well.

01:40:17.467 --> 01:40:20.262
You said earlier you
couldn’t stand us being apart.

01:40:20.287 --> 01:40:21.596
That’ll be my problem.

01:40:26.172 --> 01:40:27.172
Alright.

01:40:29.296 --> 01:40:31.590
Alright, I’ll call Dad.
I’ll tell him I’m in.

01:40:40.703 --> 01:40:42.415
I’m always the one adjusting,

01:40:43.287 --> 01:40:44.746
so let’s go all the way.

01:40:54.427 --> 01:40:56.273
You know what, to avoid complications,
let’s just break up.

01:40:56.298 --> 01:40:58.020
- Fine!
- Asshole!

01:41:00.577 --> 01:41:02.926
Luna! Do you know
your problem, Luna?

01:41:03.001 --> 01:41:06.171
You want me to be honest,
but when I am, you take it against me.

01:41:06.196 --> 01:41:08.702
- I hate you!
- I hate you even more!

01:41:08.727 --> 01:41:10.562
You’re always throwing jabs!

01:41:10.587 --> 01:41:12.909
You always make it look like
you’re the martyr in this relationship.

01:41:12.934 --> 01:41:16.126
Then I’m the selfish bitch
who only thinks of herself.

01:41:16.151 --> 01:41:19.363
I already said I won’t go if you don’t
want me to, yet you keep nagging!

01:41:19.388 --> 01:41:22.249
Then what, if you regret
it in life, you’ll blame me?

01:41:22.433 --> 01:41:24.745
You just want me to choose
so you don’t have to make the decision.

01:41:24.852 --> 01:41:27.478
When you, yourself,
can’t handle the guilt.

01:41:27.503 --> 01:41:29.334
You pretend to be strong, but you’re not.

01:41:29.400 --> 01:41:31.674
- Whatever, do what you want!
- Fine!

01:41:31.699 --> 01:41:34.443
Go and leave me, Luna.
I’m useless to you anyway, right?

01:41:34.444 --> 01:41:36.340
Go make all your dreams
come true without me,

01:41:36.371 --> 01:41:38.111
after all, you’ve always felt...

01:41:38.136 --> 01:41:39.856
that you’re a strong and independent woman!

01:41:45.038 --> 01:41:46.038
You know what?

01:41:46.249 --> 01:41:50.128
I hope you find a woman who needs
nothing else in her life but you.

01:41:50.463 --> 01:41:52.882
Since you get no validation
unless someone needs you.

01:42:48.818 --> 01:42:53.223
Once a Kasama, always a Kasama!

01:42:53.609 --> 01:42:56.571
Botejyu delivery for Luna Cabigting.

01:42:57.194 --> 01:42:59.215
- Here's your food.
- Let's go.

01:42:59.363 --> 01:43:00.618
Thank you!

01:43:00.643 --> 01:43:03.634
I can already hear
your stomachs, let’s eat.

01:43:05.202 --> 01:43:06.837
Wow, Luna Cabigting!

01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:08.237
Big time!

01:43:08.262 --> 01:43:10.532
[scoffs] Big time, you say.

01:43:11.041 --> 01:43:13.543
I don’t even know if I
can handle life there.

01:43:14.770 --> 01:43:17.940
I could always visit you there, you know.

01:43:18.992 --> 01:43:20.279
Just kidding. As if!

01:43:27.235 --> 01:43:28.664
- But Luns,
- Hmm?

01:43:29.535 --> 01:43:30.996
from the bottom of my heart.

01:43:31.853 --> 01:43:33.196
I’m so proud of you.

01:43:33.855 --> 01:43:35.699
And I’m really happy for you.

01:43:37.109 --> 01:43:38.109
Thank you.

01:43:42.989 --> 01:43:44.516
By the way, how about your boyfriend,

01:43:45.663 --> 01:43:46.904
is he following you there?

01:43:49.621 --> 01:43:50.679
We’re not together anymore.

01:43:51.279 --> 01:43:52.279
What?

01:43:52.710 --> 01:43:53.710
Since when?

01:43:54.287 --> 01:43:55.288
Just recently.

01:43:56.086 --> 01:43:59.421
Looks like we couldn’t handle
long distance, so that’s that.

01:44:01.383 --> 01:44:02.592
I could handle it.

01:44:04.933 --> 01:44:07.364
Just kidding... it’s a prank!

01:44:07.462 --> 01:44:08.880
- Let’s eat.
- Okay.

01:44:09.098 --> 01:44:10.659
I was just kidding,
don’t take it seriously.

01:44:10.684 --> 01:44:11.684
Just kidding, okay?

01:44:12.952 --> 01:44:14.870
I’ll miss you!

01:44:16.648 --> 01:44:19.818
Call me when you land there, okay?

01:44:21.469 --> 01:44:24.096
Promise to behave
while I’m gone, okay?

01:44:24.507 --> 01:44:27.426
Don't you start dating assholes again.

01:44:27.451 --> 01:44:33.333
Excuse me, I’m way too busy
with live selling to bother with that.

01:44:33.476 --> 01:44:35.687
You’re allowed to love again,

01:44:35.917 --> 01:44:40.468
just not with troublesome
guys please. I beg you.

01:44:40.546 --> 01:44:42.458
- Promise?
- Yes.

01:45:01.532 --> 01:45:02.532
Luna!

01:45:17.818 --> 01:45:20.498
I just came to send you off
and wish you well on your journey.

01:45:22.756 --> 01:45:26.009
I sincerely hope all
your dreams come true.

01:45:30.555 --> 01:45:32.224
I wish the same for you.

01:45:34.707 --> 01:45:40.843
Do even better, okay, so you
can save even more broken people.

01:45:41.942 --> 01:45:43.109
Like me.

01:45:58.291 --> 01:46:02.212
But don’t forget to
save some for yourself.

01:46:03.588 --> 01:46:04.965
Promise me.

01:46:08.093 --> 01:46:09.302
Promise.

01:46:17.238 --> 01:46:20.742
This is probably the last
flower I’ll ever give you.

01:46:25.316 --> 01:46:30.790
But I think this counts
as a live agricultural product.

01:46:31.113 --> 01:46:32.531
I can't bring it.

01:46:33.321 --> 01:46:34.321
Is that so?

01:46:36.204 --> 01:46:37.455
I understand.

01:46:40.250 --> 01:46:41.332
Anyway...

01:46:42.626 --> 01:46:43.835
Have a safe flight.

01:46:44.796 --> 01:46:48.758

01:46:49.926 --> 01:46:56.308

Wait.

01:47:21.541 --> 01:47:23.126
Maybe I can sneak it through.

01:47:24.623 --> 01:47:25.727

This is Luna and me.

01:48:10.924 --> 01:48:13.969
Having bid farewell to
each other as friends.

01:48:14.798 --> 01:48:16.758
Or maybe best friends?

01:48:18.098 --> 01:48:19.474
Ex-lovers?

01:48:20.001 --> 01:48:21.405
I don't know.

01:48:22.227 --> 01:48:27.924
Maybe, as souls who needed each other
temporarily to heal and grow...

01:48:28.562 --> 01:48:33.859
But now, we need to go our separate
ways to achieve greater things.

01:48:34.830 --> 01:48:35.830
Ah...

01:48:36.488 --> 01:48:38.198
So that’s what love is.

01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:40.829
It's not forever,

01:48:41.538 --> 01:48:44.908
but true while it lasts.
