Crazy.

Which kind are we eating?

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:21.070
Aren't they all the same?

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.510
Just add some sausage and pickles
when you prepare it.

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:24.670
We don't have sausage.

00:00:24.670 --> 00:00:25.720
Go out and buy some then.

00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:26.590
Me go buy it?

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.210
Then I should go?

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.460

Just making do.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:48.780

So we're actually eating
something decent, right?

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.010
Director Peng.

00:01:05.069 --> 00:01:07.530
You've got everything you need
to cook here.

00:01:08.740 --> 00:01:10.810
Well, that's what happens
after too much overtime.

00:01:10.810 --> 00:01:13.250
You even beat the egg before adding it.

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.070
It absorbs the flavor better this way.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.280
Most importantly,

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:19.039
two eggs aren't easy
to share among three people.

00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:24.840
Alright.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:29.020
Okay.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:31.260
First, add some

00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:32.530
sesame oil.

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:36.150
Smells good.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.150
Now add some vinegar.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:42.300
Okay.

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:44.720
Mix it up.

00:01:51.870 --> 00:01:53.520
I know this case

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:55.640
has too many loose ends,

00:01:56.479 --> 00:01:58.509
and the clues are overwhelming,

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.640
which has been quite frustrating for you.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:03.310
Not at all.
This is just the normal process.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:06.230
Actually,

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:08.240
at times like this,

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.340
you can't rush things.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:12.090
Right now,

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.690
you could take a step back

00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:15.030
and let things breathe.

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:15.960
Perhaps

00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.590
in those unexpected places,

00:02:18.820 --> 00:02:20.620
you'll find your breakthrough.

To be honest with you,

00:02:22.630 --> 00:02:24.240
when I was in the narcotics unit,

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:25.760
my mentor taught me the same thing.

00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.560

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.600
are quite effective.

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:35.090
Thank you, Director Peng.

00:02:37.430 --> 00:02:38.490

were saying the same thing,

and they all claimed to have no clue
what happened.

The scene wasn't exactly pitch black.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:59.720
How could they not see the person
who hit them right in the face?

00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:00.860
That's ridiculous.

We're confused, too.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:07.600
Do they even want the police station
to catch the person?

00:08:07.600 --> 00:08:10.660
They probably don't want
the police station involved.

that might help us get some leads.

00:08:48.550 --> 00:08:50.550

at the police station.

00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:23.050

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:24.460

00:09:33.790 --> 00:09:34.630
was the one

00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:36.500
who told me to...

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:37.370
I know it.

00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:39.140
He sent me here.

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:42.440
Tell me more details.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:45.760
Actually, I

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.890
don't know much.

00:09:47.670 --> 00:09:48.360
But I know

00:09:48.390 --> 00:09:50.400
there was someone squatting in the yard.

00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:51.910
He first got into an argument

00:09:51.910 --> 00:09:52.740
with Wenxuan.

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:54.750
Then he beat him up.

00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.300
And he was saying something like,

00:09:59.910 --> 00:10:01.440
"You got my brother killed.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:04.370
It's all because
of your father's project."

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.660
What he said

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.120
made no sense to me at all.

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:08.450
Well,

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:09.950
that's all I know.

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:23.230
Is this the person?

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.300
Yes.

00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:25.170
That's him.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:26.420
This guy right here.

00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:27.490
I remember him.

00:10:27.590 --> 00:10:28.650
I'm sure.

00:10:33.910 --> 00:10:34.390
Peng.

00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:38.560
Have you been here the whole time?

00:10:48.070 --> 00:10:49.200
I brought some food.

00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.440
You'll wear yourself out
if you keep pushing like this.

00:10:57.680 --> 00:10:59.610
I brought two packs of cigarettes.

00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:01.600
I'll leave them here.

00:11:05.750 --> 00:11:06.360
Peng.

00:11:08.170 --> 00:11:09.480
We've found the people

00:11:09.710 --> 00:11:10.840
who beat up Wenxuan.

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.980
We've already send people to arrest him.

00:11:12.980 --> 00:11:13.770
Don't worry.

00:11:14.820 --> 00:11:15.530
Thank you.

00:11:17.750 --> 00:11:18.940
To be honest,

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:22.100
after all these years,

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:24.170
we're like family now,

00:11:25.150 --> 00:11:25.750
aren't we?

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:29.510
It hurts me
to see Wenxuan lying here like this.

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:33.710
I know you must be feeling even worse.

00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.680
I don't know how to comfort you right now.

00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.160
But I want to help you
figure out why this happened.

00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.740
I've checked into Feng Hai's situation.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.440
His family's financial condition

00:11:47.670 --> 00:11:48.730
is extremely poor.

00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:51.800
He has a daughter back in his hometown.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.720
Every cent he earned from working these
years went either to raising his daughter

00:11:55.720 --> 00:11:57.920
or paying for his brother's education.

00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.060
Now that he's gone,

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:02.800
his family is basically ruined.

00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.960
His brother won't get off lightly
when caught.

00:12:07.030 --> 00:12:08.840
But why did things turn out this way,

00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:09.510
Peng?

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:12.160
Both families

00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:14.570
are destroyed.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:17.750
Are you here to see Wenxuan

00:12:17.750 --> 00:12:19.280
or to investigate the case?

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:22.280
If you're here to investigate,

00:12:23.270 --> 00:12:24.350
please leave.

00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.460
I don't know anything.

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.090
I'm here to see Wenxuan,

00:12:29.030 --> 00:12:31.430
but I also want
to help solve your problems.

00:12:31.910 --> 00:12:33.710
With Wenxuan in this condition,

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.240
I don't want anything else
to go wrong with you,

00:12:37.240 --> 00:12:38.500
whether it's physical

00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.750
or anything

00:12:42.870 --> 00:12:44.010
else.

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:46.810
Understand?

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:50.380
Feng.

00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:51.550
Mom.

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:53.480
Go ahead with your work.

00:12:53.630 --> 00:12:55.220
I'll keep Peng company.

00:12:57.670 --> 00:12:58.550
Alright.

00:12:58.550 --> 00:12:59.200
I'll head back first.

00:12:59.200 --> 00:12:59.720
Peng.

00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:02.580
Take care of yourself.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:06.960
Mom, I'm heading back now.

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.510
Go ahead.

00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:36.120
Ziyi told me you haven't eaten for days.

00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:37.790
That won't do.

00:13:38.870 --> 00:13:42.000
Compared to Wenxuan, you're the one
who worries us more.

00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.150
You need to take care of yourself first.

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:48.200
Otherwise, who will look after Wenxuan?

00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:50.660
I've been simmering this soup all morning.

00:13:51.670 --> 00:13:53.200
Wenxuan can't drink it now.

00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:55.080
Take this spoon.

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:58.080
Drink it to strengthen yourself.

00:13:59.200 --> 00:14:00.500
You can't collapse.

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:03.270
If you collapse,
who will take care of Wenxuan?

00:14:09.280 --> 00:14:10.210
Last night,

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:15.600
I fell asleep while watching over him.

00:14:17.080 --> 00:14:18.270
I had a dream.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.200
I dreamed of Wenxuan when he was little.

00:14:25.030 --> 00:14:26.520
I took him traveling.

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.000
He was running and jumping around,

00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:36.550
calling me "Dad" the whole way.

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:43.240
Then,

00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:45.750
I woke up.

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.270
And I realized

00:14:50.550 --> 00:14:52.210
he was still lying right here.

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:54.950
That's when it hit me—

00:14:56.390 --> 00:14:58.450
I never actually took him traveling,

00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:00.310
not even once.

00:15:05.750 --> 00:15:07.010
Do you believe in fate?

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:10.670
Whether you believe in it or not,

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.860
what difference does it make?

00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:17.020
I didn't believe in it before.

00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:19.000
But as I got older,

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:21.870
I started to believe.

00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.080
Zhao Peng,

00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:28.250
I understand exactly
how you feel right now.

00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:31.920
I've been there, too.

00:15:32.730 --> 00:15:36.130
I've had moments when it hurt so badly
I could barely breathe.

00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.440
It was around that time

00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:39.900
that Tianye's father suddenly passed away.

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.090
It felt like

00:15:43.390 --> 00:15:45.080
I'd been holding on the whole time.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:46.230
But deep down,

00:15:47.510 --> 00:15:48.870
it was just unbearable.

00:15:50.720 --> 00:15:52.440
That period was extremely difficult.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.660
It really was.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:57.120
Later,

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.660
I slowly realized

00:16:02.550 --> 00:16:03.680
it's all fate.

00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.640
It's meant to be this way.

00:16:08.360 --> 00:16:10.110
My son was so stubborn.

00:16:10.910 --> 00:16:13.170
The consequences will catch up with him.

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:16.330
I didn't raise my child properly.

00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:19.820

00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:30.130
cannot be changed.

00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:31.940
But

00:16:32.030 --> 00:16:33.240
perhaps we can still change

00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.750
what hasn't happened yet.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.060
Zhao Peng,

00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.020
you need to believe
there are miracles in modern times.

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:43.920
Modern medicine is very advanced.

00:16:46.610 --> 00:16:48.800
Perhaps Wenxuan will recover.

Feng Jiang's brother

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:12.599
was a worker at the construction site.

00:17:13.310 --> 00:17:16.109
His cause of death
was actually quite suspicious.

00:17:16.750 --> 00:17:17.930
I strongly suspect

00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.960
there was a cover-up
in the Hangang Project accident.

00:17:21.310 --> 00:17:23.790
You mean there's more

00:17:24.380 --> 00:17:25.550
to this accident?

00:17:26.069 --> 00:17:27.349
There's no direct evidence,

00:17:27.349 --> 00:17:28.880
but what happened there

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:30.910
is worth investigating.

[Hanzhou Public Security Bureau]

We're already
investigating Feng Jiang's report.

The key now is to find him.

00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:40.750
But since Feng Jiang is involved
in Zhao Wenxuan's case,

00:17:41.510 --> 00:17:43.440
you might need to recuse yourself.

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.500
So,

00:21:41.350 --> 00:21:44.480
Just to be safe,
I'll arrange the transfer immediately.

00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:45.640
Sir,

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:47.240
I have an idea.

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:48.310
Go ahead.

00:21:48.310 --> 00:21:49.910
Since we suspect

00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:52.620
that someone has discovered
the task force,

00:21:52.920 --> 00:21:54.920
we can't rule out this possibility.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.040
Why doesn't

00:21:56.310 --> 00:21:57.880
the task force directly expose

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.780
Hangang Center's concealment?

00:22:00.510 --> 00:22:01.640
Let's stir things up

00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:03.860
to cover us.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.480
My mentor and I

00:22:05.750 --> 00:22:07.440
can keep investigating on the down low.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.900
You mean

00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.350
you want the task force
to provide cover for you?

00:22:11.350 --> 00:22:12.110
Yes.

00:22:12.510 --> 00:22:13.820
Because Feng Jiang

00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:15.510
is not our primary target now.

00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:17.830
Feng Jiang doesn't know much.

00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:20.370
Our current target

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:22.400
should be Zhao Peng.

00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:25.200
He's worked at Tianyun Group
for many years

00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.070
and has a lot of inside information.

00:22:27.070 --> 00:22:28.230
Besides,

00:22:28.750 --> 00:22:29.710
his son

00:22:29.830 --> 00:22:32.290
was recently injured
because of Feng Jiang.

00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:35.720
I think this is a good opportunity
for a breakthrough.

00:22:36.030 --> 00:22:36.840
But...

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.940
You're close to Zhao Peng.

00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.770
If you approach him rashly,

00:22:42.200 --> 00:22:44.720
I'm worried someone
might try to set you up.

00:22:45.710 --> 00:22:47.370
I've thought about that, too.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.720
But it doesn't matter.

00:22:49.790 --> 00:22:51.690
If someone does come forward,

00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.050
then we'll also know

00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:55.480
who else is on their side.

00:22:58.480 --> 00:22:59.740
I agree with your plan,

00:23:00.070 --> 00:23:02.450
but you must report every step you take.

00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:03.350
I understand.

00:23:04.590 --> 00:23:05.440
[Hanzhou, Binjiang]

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.970
Thank you for your concern.

00:23:07.300 --> 00:23:09.900
I'll stabilize the situation here
in Hanzhou.

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.200
Please rest assured.

00:23:12.790 --> 00:23:13.960
Thank you.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.700
Thank you, Mentor.

00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:18.310
I'll hang up now.

00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:24.190
Come in.

00:23:33.790 --> 00:23:34.590
Mayor Hong.

00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.790
There are no outsiders here.

00:23:37.790 --> 00:23:38.920
No need to be formal.

00:23:39.510 --> 00:23:40.170
Have a seat.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.920
I'm here to report the situation to you.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:45.750
I think

00:23:46.240 --> 00:23:47.700
Qin Feng and the task force

00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:50.310
might have already connected.

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:52.440
I tailed them the whole way,

00:23:52.440 --> 00:23:53.900
but I turned back halfway—

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.860
I was afraid of being spotted.

00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:57.790
Did they spot you?

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:01.590
I wouldn't say I'm exposed, not yet.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.720
But hear me out.

00:24:04.790 --> 00:24:05.970
That senior of his—

00:24:06.110 --> 00:24:07.160
Mai Hongchao—

00:24:07.350 --> 00:24:08.200
there's no way he's clean.

00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:09.840
He's definitely involved.

00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:10.590
Ye

00:24:10.590 --> 00:24:12.410
must also be watching secretly.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.280
And with Director Chu in the mix,

00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.720
this is no small operation.

00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:19.540
What worries me most right now

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.400
is that we may already be

00:24:21.400 --> 00:24:23.070
on the task force's radar.

00:24:24.210 --> 00:24:25.400
Mentor just

00:24:25.590 --> 00:24:26.940
called me.

00:24:27.510 --> 00:24:29.240
I specifically mentioned you.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.070
The future cadre team

00:24:32.070 --> 00:24:33.880
is trending younger.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:36.580
Yan is already this age.

00:24:36.640 --> 00:24:37.920
It's time for a change.

00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:39.920
You're in your prime.

00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:42.210
So, you still have a chance.

00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:45.590
The matter I mentioned to you last time

00:24:46.310 --> 00:24:47.070
will likely

00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.960
be implemented soon.

00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:52.110
I know,

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:54.000
you genuinely want to support me.

00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.240
But you must handle things well first.

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:59.270
Once you're the head of an organization,

00:24:59.270 --> 00:25:01.160
you have to be the one
who solves problems,

00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:04.420
not someone who waits for others
to solve problems for you.

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:07.160
All these years,

00:25:08.350 --> 00:25:09.610
every step we've taken

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.540
has been like walking on thin ice.

00:25:11.790 --> 00:25:14.350
One wrong move and we lose everything.

00:25:16.270 --> 00:25:17.160
I understand.

00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:18.800
I know you

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:21.200
truly mean to back me.

00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:23.320
You want to give me a hand.

00:25:24.240 --> 00:25:25.040
Rest assured,

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:26.510
I'll work harder,

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:27.680
push myself,

00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:29.590
and reach higher.

00:25:32.790 --> 00:25:33.440
Good.

00:25:34.480 --> 00:25:35.830
Let's work together

00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:38.170
to overcome these difficulties.

00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:11.720
Qin Feng.

00:26:15.130 --> 00:26:15.980
What's wrong?

00:26:18.050 --> 00:26:20.650
I remember when we were on duty
at the bureau,

00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:23.810
Director Peng used to cook noodles for us.

00:26:25.960 --> 00:26:27.220
Could it really be him?

00:26:30.310 --> 00:26:31.480
No matter what,

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:33.240
right now,

00:26:33.640 --> 00:26:35.700
we don't have concrete evidence yet.

00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:38.760
Keep playing your part for now.

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:41.160
I understand.

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.330
Leave the cover-up investigation

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:46.920
to us.

00:26:47.510 --> 00:26:50.840
The task force has already
begun its direct investigation.

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:55.150
Who knows how many people
this will implicate?

00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.900
Since the task force has come to Hanzhou,

00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.860
we're not afraid of
how big this earthquake will be.

00:27:03.550 --> 00:27:05.400
Behind Zhao Peng

00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:07.480
is Tianyun Group.

00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.200
That's my brother's.

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:13.480
Once confirmed,

00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.000
you should recuse yourself.

00:27:16.350 --> 00:27:17.110
Don't worry.

00:27:17.270 --> 00:27:18.270
We're still here.

00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:21.200
Perhaps

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:25.400
the mystery is about to be solved.

00:27:28.270 --> 00:27:29.730
How do you feel about this?

00:27:33.310 --> 00:27:34.710
I dare not think about it.

00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:38.880
Alright.

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:40.140
Investigate further.

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:41.160
Director Chu.

00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.070
Nice to meet you.

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:42.900
Mayor Hong.

00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:43.780
Nice to meet you.

00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:44.710
Nice to meet you.

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:45.350
Party Secretary Li.

00:27:45.350 --> 00:27:47.350
-Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.000
How is it?

00:27:48.480 --> 00:27:50.500
Is this place spacious enough?

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:51.480
If not,

00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:53.810
I'll try to clear two more offices
for you.

00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:54.750
It's enough.

00:27:55.590 --> 00:27:56.590
Besides, we shouldn't

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:58.000
disrupt others' work.

00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:00.510
Our small place has poor conditions.

00:28:00.510 --> 00:28:01.640
During this period,

00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:03.720
I'm afraid Director Chu
will have to bear with it.

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.400
Mayor Hong, you must be joking.

00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:06.680
We're here to work.

00:28:07.030 --> 00:28:08.960
Why would we need to stay in a villa?

00:28:10.110 --> 00:28:11.310
Besides, look,

00:28:11.310 --> 00:28:13.510
we've been through
all kinds of harsh conditions.

00:28:13.510 --> 00:28:15.790
We've faced all sorts
of dangerous situations.

00:28:15.790 --> 00:28:17.650
Don't worry. We will not be fussy.

00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.160
Welcome, Director Chu.

00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.160
Thank you for coming to guide our work.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:23.110
If you need anything, just let me know.

00:28:23.110 --> 00:28:25.970
I'll do my best to coordinate
and support your work.

00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:27.640
Thank you, Party Secretary Li.

00:28:27.640 --> 00:28:28.900
Thank you, Mayor Hong.

00:28:29.070 --> 00:28:31.110
And thank you for the support
from the city government.

00:28:31.110 --> 00:28:32.440
Let's sit down and talk.

00:28:32.680 --> 00:28:33.590
Sure, please.

00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:39.640
Both of you leaders.

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:41.200
-Sit
-Okay. Thank you.

00:28:46.510 --> 00:28:47.400
I believe you both know

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:49.270
why I'm here today.

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:51.240
As Feng Jiang's video

00:28:51.240 --> 00:28:53.000
continues to spread online,

00:28:53.270 --> 00:28:54.870
it has created quite a storm.

00:28:55.110 --> 00:28:56.270
The provincial government
has issued a document,

00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:57.960
instructing us
to form a task force

00:28:57.960 --> 00:29:00.680
to reinvestigate the safety incident

00:29:00.830 --> 00:29:02.290
at Hangang Center

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:05.040
and reach a conclusion
as soon as possible.

00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:06.330
That's excellent.

00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:08.350
With Director Chu in charge,

00:29:08.350 --> 00:29:10.240
the heavy burden on my mind

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.840
has finally been lifted.

00:29:12.070 --> 00:29:13.400
To be honest,
with such a major incident,

00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:15.790
we might not be able
to sort everything out clearly.

00:29:15.790 --> 00:29:18.320
Were there
any illegal activities involved?

00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:20.440
Why was information concealed?

00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:21.960
Who tampered with evidence?

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:24.500
Are there any other

00:29:24.590 --> 00:29:26.550
parties responsible
for the safety incident?

00:29:26.550 --> 00:29:27.610
Is it possible that

00:29:27.750 --> 00:29:30.350
some comrades, in a moment of confusion,

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.320
were drawn in and corrupted?

00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.720
The provincial authorities
have instructed us

00:29:33.720 --> 00:29:35.590
that this must be thoroughly investigated.

00:29:35.590 --> 00:29:37.400
At the same time, we've been instructed

00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:39.350
to pursue accountability
and impose severe penalties

00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:41.950
to prevent a recurrence
of similar incidents.

00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:44.110
We're here

00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:46.080
under tremendous pressure.

00:29:46.310 --> 00:29:47.200
We hope

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:49.200
to work together with the city government,

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.200
pulling together,

00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:52.000
to handle this matter properly.

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:54.790
Director Chu was absolutely right.

00:29:54.790 --> 00:29:57.370
If corruption truly exists in this case,

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:58.240
rest assured,

00:29:58.590 --> 00:30:00.720
I will definitely investigate it
thoroughly.

00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:01.780
No matter who it is,

00:30:01.790 --> 00:30:04.000
and regardless of
how much controversy there may be,

00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.590
everything must
be thoroughly investigated

00:30:05.590 --> 00:30:07.790
and an explanation given to the public.

00:30:09.350 --> 00:30:10.150
Furthermore,

00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.280
I believe that with this matter,

00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:13.790
every additional day it drags on

00:30:13.790 --> 00:30:15.790
erodes the public's trust

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:16.880
in us.

00:30:17.750 --> 00:30:19.070
Director Chu, what do you think

00:30:19.070 --> 00:30:20.270
about this proposal?

00:30:21.510 --> 00:30:22.570
Give us a deadline.

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:24.000
For example,

00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:24.830
ten days.

00:30:25.680 --> 00:30:28.000
If we can conclude the investigation
within ten days,

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:29.920
the municipal government will cooperate

00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.000
and issue a corresponding
public statement.

00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:32.960
What do you think?

00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:34.420
Ten days...

00:30:34.790 --> 00:30:35.720
I'm afraid...

00:30:37.310 --> 00:30:38.790
Then, how about half a month?

00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:39.790
What do you think?

00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:42.310
Personally,

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:43.970
there's no need to rush.

00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.530
With such a major incident in Hanzhou,

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:49.080
as the Party Secretary,

00:30:49.750 --> 00:30:51.590
I should be the first to self-criticize.

00:30:51.590 --> 00:30:52.720
Self-examination.

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.590
The more urgent the situation,

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:57.190
the more we need to stay calm.

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:58.550
Some issues

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:01.070
should first be investigated internally.

00:31:01.070 --> 00:31:03.200
Party Secretary Li made a valid point.

00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:04.270
Yes.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.270
Speaking of self-criticism,

00:31:07.270 --> 00:31:08.470
as the acting mayor,

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:10.750
I should be the first to examine myself.

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:11.790
But I want to say,

00:31:12.350 --> 00:31:15.680
if sitting in the office
writing self-criticisms every day

00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:18.070
would satisfy the people of Hanzhou,

00:31:20.790 --> 00:31:22.190
then I have no objection.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:23.030
Of course,

00:31:23.110 --> 00:31:25.040
this is just my humble suggestion.

00:31:25.310 --> 00:31:27.350
Please think about it, Director Chu.

00:31:27.350 --> 00:31:29.030
If we rush the investigation,

00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.300
I'm afraid too many people
might be implicated.

00:31:32.750 --> 00:31:34.110
Haste makes waste.

00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:36.980
Well...

00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:39.330
Both of you leaders have valid points.

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:42.400
I understand the pressure
from the city government.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.030
Well.

00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:45.430
To better handle this matter,

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:46.440
the provincial department

00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:47.590
will provide a conclusion

00:31:47.590 --> 00:31:48.750
within half a month.

00:31:49.270 --> 00:31:50.730
Meanwhile, we'll also try

00:31:50.830 --> 00:31:51.640
to minimize

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:53.800
the impact as much as possible.

00:31:58.790 --> 00:31:59.920
Party Secretary Li.

00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.480
I think this matter

00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:02.610
should be...

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:03.750
Come in.

00:32:06.110 --> 00:32:08.350
Party Secretary Li, Mayor Hong,
you wanted to see me?

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:09.010
Have a seat.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.660
Director Chu and his team

00:32:15.660 --> 00:32:17.650
have entered the municipal government

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:20.580
and are investigating
the cover-up of the accident.

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:22.960
We've already reported to the task force.

00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:25.030
We now suspect
the contractor concealed information.

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:27.290
However, it goes beyond the contractor.

00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:28.970
The issuance of this notice

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:31.030
likely implicates supervisory officials
as well,

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:34.960
involving serious dereliction
of duty and disciplinary violations.

00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:37.530
I remember Director Qin from Hanzhou Port

00:32:37.880 --> 00:32:40.700
has very close ties with Tianyun Group.

00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:42.770
The Hangang Center project

00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:44.480
was approved under his leadership.

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:45.540
No matter who it is,

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.520
they must be severely punished.

00:32:52.350 --> 00:32:53.480
Also, Director Yan,

00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.420
we asked you here today

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:56.970
for another matter as well.

00:32:57.070 --> 00:32:59.440
We're arranging for you to attend training

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:00.450
for two months.

00:33:02.240 --> 00:33:02.840
Training?

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:03.480
Yes.

00:33:05.110 --> 00:33:06.670
There's so much going on
at the bureau right now.

00:33:06.670 --> 00:33:08.200
I'm afraid I can't get away.

00:33:08.750 --> 00:33:10.580
It's an assignment
from the provincial level.

00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:11.840
It can't be postponed.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:12.920
Besides,

00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.280
at the bureau,

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.970
isn't Peng still there?

00:33:17.720 --> 00:33:20.050
Get the handover done as soon as possible.

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:22.350
All right.

[Hanzhou Club]

00:33:26.830 --> 00:33:28.000
I won't waste time

with unnecessary words.

00:33:29.640 --> 00:33:32.830
The task force has already moved
into the municipal government.

00:33:32.830 --> 00:33:35.000
They're reopening the investigation,

00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.200
especially into the issue
of the construction cover-up.

00:33:38.310 --> 00:33:39.790
You know about this, right?

00:33:39.790 --> 00:33:40.850
I saw it in the news.

00:33:41.720 --> 00:33:42.790
We entrusted you

00:33:42.790 --> 00:33:44.390
with a critical stronghold,

00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:45.930
and you turned it

00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.160
into a sieve.

00:33:48.680 --> 00:33:51.080
The boss is very dissatisfied
with you now.

00:33:51.590 --> 00:33:53.390
He's demanding answers from me.

00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:56.170
Come on, Mr. Liu.

00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:57.550
Tell me,

00:33:58.550 --> 00:34:00.640
how am I supposed
to explain this to him?

00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:01.570
First of all,

00:34:01.830 --> 00:34:03.430
please tell him not to worry.

00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.350
There have been some minor issues,

00:34:05.350 --> 00:34:07.620
but I'll put out this spark quickly.

00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:10.070
The question now is how to put it out.

00:34:11.190 --> 00:34:12.590
And what if you can't?

00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:14.840
Do we all go down with you?

Or do we make you take the fall?

00:34:18.010 --> 00:34:19.000

00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:21.030
don't be too hard on Mr. Liu.

This matter

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:25.230
should have been my responsibility
in the first place.

00:34:25.230 --> 00:34:27.690

what they can handle.

00:34:28.920 --> 00:34:29.840
But Mr. Liu,

00:34:30.190 --> 00:34:31.800
you need to understand something.

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:56.420
I'm telling you, I won't go!

00:36:56.450 --> 00:36:58.910
I'm staying right here!
I won't go anywhere!

00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:00.590
If you've got the guts,

00:37:00.590 --> 00:37:02.190
call the police to arrest me!

00:37:02.230 --> 00:37:04.090
I won't give face to anyone today!

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:05.670
Call the police to arrest me!

00:37:05.670 --> 00:37:06.510
Arrest me!

00:37:09.510 --> 00:37:10.230
Mr. Liu,

00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:12.730
your man—

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.160
if you can't control him,

00:37:14.710 --> 00:37:15.830
then I will.

00:37:20.230 --> 00:37:20.900
Don't move.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.520
What are you gonna do,

00:37:28.710 --> 00:37:29.850
hurt me?

00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:31.560
Go on, try it.

00:37:31.590 --> 00:37:33.250
Acting all tough with me, huh?

00:37:33.280 --> 00:37:33.840
Peng.

00:37:34.590 --> 00:37:35.760
Take him away to sober up.

00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.080
Go sober up first. Go.

00:37:37.190 --> 00:37:38.850
He's acting all tough with me.

00:37:46.110 --> 00:37:46.760
Mr. Liu.

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:48.760
Well, look at you—

00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.780
got some nerve now.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.990
Pointing a gun at me?

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:58.230
Tell him to pull the trigger.
Try it.

00:38:01.550 --> 00:38:02.080
Go ahead.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:06.800
Zhao Peng...

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:08.480
He's my man.

00:38:09.580 --> 00:38:10.260
If

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:11.960
you try to harm him,

00:38:15.800 --> 00:38:16.480
just try it.

00:38:22.510 --> 00:38:23.150
Fine.

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.290
So Zhao Peng is off-limits.

00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:27.780
What about your brother Qin Feng?

00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.800
He's the one giving us
the most trouble now.

00:38:31.110 --> 00:38:31.800
What?

00:38:32.230 --> 00:38:33.490
He's off-limits, too?

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.340
I only want one answer from you today.

00:38:36.350 --> 00:38:38.070
Can you take him down?

00:38:41.390 --> 00:38:42.850
You want an answer from me?

00:38:43.990 --> 00:38:45.190
Let me tell you now.

00:38:46.070 --> 00:38:47.930
I'm not the Liu Tianye I used to be.

00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:50.690
And Longwan isn't the same place anymore.

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.650
My people, my business—

00:38:52.900 --> 00:38:54.100
I make the decisions.

00:38:54.670 --> 00:38:55.360
You people

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:56.400
don't.

00:39:06.320 --> 00:39:07.030
Mr. Liu.

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:09.680
You have quite a lot of opinions

00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:10.960
about the boss.

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:14.010
I know what you're trying to do.

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:16.570
You want to kick us all out of the game.

00:39:17.070 --> 00:39:18.000
But don't forget

00:39:18.590 --> 00:39:21.320
who gave you this opportunity
in the first place.

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.930
You think you're really qualified now?

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:25.480
I earned my place through my own efforts,
so of course I'm qualified.

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.000
And I'm very satisfied with our boss.

00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:28.230
I've done so much work
these past few years

00:39:28.230 --> 00:39:29.880
and made so much money for all of us.

00:39:29.880 --> 00:39:32.030
You've all gotten your fair share
of the profits, haven't you?

00:39:32.030 --> 00:39:34.710
So why push us out
when there's trouble?

00:39:34.840 --> 00:39:36.110
We're all in the same boat—

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:37.400
the boss included.

00:39:38.230 --> 00:39:39.890
Now you're saying I have a problem
with the boss?

00:39:39.890 --> 00:39:41.670
Isn't it you who has problems with him?

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:43.920
When trouble comes, you try
to drag the boss down?

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:44.590
Ms. Zhang.

00:39:45.400 --> 00:39:47.460
I'm the one cleaning up your mess now.

00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.530
Get your facts straight, okay?

00:39:57.630 --> 00:39:58.480
Liu Tianye.

00:40:00.550 --> 00:40:01.800
You remember this.

00:40:03.070 --> 00:40:04.600
Everything you said today,

00:40:05.110 --> 00:40:07.040
I'll report it exactly to the boss.

00:40:08.110 --> 00:40:09.670
Then please tell him

00:40:10.550 --> 00:40:13.610
I'd really like
to have a private conversation with him

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.530
when none of you are around.

00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:49.250
Director Chen,

00:40:49.440 --> 00:40:51.600
Liu Tianye's ambitions
are getting bigger by the day.

00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:53.550
He shows no respect for us now.

00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:56.230
He screwed things up,

00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:58.710
and now he was talking
like he was in the right.

00:40:58.710 --> 00:41:00.150
The task force has arrived.

00:41:00.150 --> 00:41:01.550
Have they found Feng Jiang?

00:41:01.550 --> 00:41:03.110
We can't hide the truth forever.

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:05.070
This will blow up eventually.

00:41:06.030 --> 00:41:08.190
Liu Tianye didn't clean up properly,

00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:09.880
leaving a big mess behind.

00:41:11.030 --> 00:41:13.600
We need to think three steps ahead.

00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:16.130
Regarding the boss,

00:41:16.630 --> 00:41:17.830
we need you

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:19.700
to put in a good word.

00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:20.760
Don't worry.

00:41:20.920 --> 00:41:22.150
What you can't bring up,

00:41:22.150 --> 00:41:23.350
I'll tell him myself.

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:27.360
He really thinks his wings
are strong enough

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:28.510
to fly solo now?

00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:36.840
Tianye.

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:50.930
I understand how you feel.

00:41:52.110 --> 00:41:54.510
What parent could ever walk away
and leave their child behind—

00:41:54.510 --> 00:41:57.510
especially with Wenxuan in the condition
he's in now?

00:41:57.890 --> 00:41:58.920
But we're

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:01.060
in a precarious situation right now.

00:42:01.110 --> 00:42:03.040
What I'm more worried about is you.

00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:07.790
Think about it this way.

00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:10.140
When the time is right,

00:42:10.190 --> 00:42:11.780
we can send Wenxuan abroad for treatment.

00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:13.030
Wouldn't that be better?

00:42:13.030 --> 00:42:14.150
You can be reunited later,

00:42:14.150 --> 00:42:14.690
right?

00:42:15.070 --> 00:42:16.630
You can rest assured—he's fine here.

00:42:16.630 --> 00:42:18.090
We'll all take care of him.

00:42:18.150 --> 00:42:21.280
And Ziyi is here, too,
so there's nothing to worry about.

00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.570
It was all my fault.

00:42:26.480 --> 00:42:28.210
I'm the one who harmed Wenxuan.

00:42:32.210 --> 00:42:33.490
Madam Wen was right.

00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:36.510
This is fate.

00:42:43.890 --> 00:42:46.350
You don't need to try
to persuade me anymore.

00:42:46.660 --> 00:42:48.260
I'm definitely not leaving.

00:42:49.190 --> 00:42:50.230
I want to stay

00:42:51.510 --> 00:42:52.400
with Wenxuan.

00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:54.460
Even if the police arrest me,

00:42:55.670 --> 00:42:56.440
I'll accept it.
