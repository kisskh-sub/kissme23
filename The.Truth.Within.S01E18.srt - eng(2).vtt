WEBVTT

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.130
Mr. Gao.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:42.690
Hey.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:53.130
His neck

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.220
was broken?

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.090
Yes.

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.730
The murderer used a lot of force,

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.180
causing the victim's cervical vertebrae

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.220
to fracture and become misaligned.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.090
We just checked

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.300
the victim's eyes.

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:03.900
It must have happened suddenly.

00:01:04.150 --> 00:01:05.050
He didn't have time to react.

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:16.570
This powder

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.490
was probably sprinkled

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:19.900
on him after he died.

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:21.490
Good.

00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:13.260
[Episode 18]

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:30.500
The body is still warm.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:31.780
The suspect shouldn't have gone far.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.450
Request backup.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:34.780
Conduct a thorough search.

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:35.940
Okay.

00:03:59.470 --> 00:03:59.940
Chen,

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.850
are you really going to
switch to psychology?

00:04:05.150 --> 00:04:06.980
The trauma from mental illness

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:07.850
far outweighs

00:04:07.870 --> 00:04:09.540
the pain from physical illness.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.220
Helping others is helping yourself.

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:15.980
You're too young.

00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:17.340
You'll understand when you grow up.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:18.580
I'm not a kid.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:22.700
Promise me

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.020
you'll become an excellent

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.850
forensic pathologist.

00:04:28.510 --> 00:04:28.900
Okay.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.020
Bye.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.610
Human

00:04:52.270 --> 00:04:53.100
consciousness

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:54.700
is like

00:04:55.920 --> 00:04:57.580
an iceberg on the water.

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.490
Only the small tip

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:01.700
above the surface

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:04.100
is what you and others

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:07.140
truly want to see.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:46.370
I never addressed

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:47.250
him as brother.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.100
I always called him Wan.

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:51.460
But now he can't

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:52.980
hear me anymore.

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:58.540
Wan would be very gratified.

00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:39.900
Salute!

00:06:52.510 --> 00:06:53.140
Attention!

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:56.100
Hats off!

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:06.250
Silent tribute!

00:07:20.870 --> 00:07:21.810
Attention!

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.250
Ms. Zhu!

00:07:57.870 --> 00:07:59.050
Based on the extracted fingerprints

00:07:59.070 --> 00:07:59.980
and skin tissue,

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.340
we compared them with the database.

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:02.490
We can now confirm

00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:03.660
the suspect is Wang Bo.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:05.850
Okay.

00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:07.930
Su.

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:10.410
Check on Wang Bo.

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:12.490
Okay.

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:19.540
Wang Bo was imprisoned four years ago

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:20.340
for intentional assault.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:20.980
After his release,

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.100
he disappeared.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.140
He told other inmates

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.780
that he had a girlfriend named Fan Xiao

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:25.780
who worked at a massage parlor.

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.050
We don't know which

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:27.780
massage parlor yet.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:30.980
Let's split up and investigate.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:33.010
We must find Wang Bo.

00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:34.060
Let's go in.

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:34.530
Okay.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:08:59.940
Gao Yuan.

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:03.220
Mr. Qi,

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:04.490
find anything?

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:05.730
Look.

00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:10.980
These drugs should all

00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.530
be experimental samples.

00:09:17.510 --> 00:09:18.340
Wang Bo has murdered

00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:19.650
Li Yiqi, Wang Chen,

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:22.060
Cui Hao, Wan Guoxin, and others.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:22.890
This constitutes

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.100
a major serial

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.250
murder case.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:26.700
If the organization behind it

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:27.460
isn't cracked soon,

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:28.580
more people

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:29.490
may die.

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:30.490
Mr. Bai.

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:33.940
We analyzed the

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:34.700
drugs extracted

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:35.940
from Chen Chuchuan's body.

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:37.060
The drugs

00:09:37.390 --> 00:09:38.370
also contain

00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:39.490
antidepressant components.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.460
We combined previous cases,

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:43.940
including Li Yiqi, Li Shuting,

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:46.730
Xiao Lin, Song Weimin, and others.

00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:47.770
We found

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.060
that the chemical formula

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.010
of this new drug has

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:51.340
been constantly modified.

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:54.300
You mean the two drugs

00:09:54.510 --> 00:09:55.490
might be the same drug?

00:09:55.750 --> 00:09:56.370
Very likely.

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.490
It should be a new type of drug.

00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.100
And Wang Bo is also

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.530
related to the new drug.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:02.890
Although we cannot

00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:04.460
yet confirm whether this drug

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:05.940
is Raw Diamond,

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.530
in terms of harm,

00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:09.060
it has surpassed Raw Diamond.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:14.650
I have already reported

00:10:15.630 --> 00:10:17.370
this case to the provincial bureaus.

00:10:17.790 --> 00:10:19.530
They have decided to establish
a special task force

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:21.130
and require our criminal
investigation team

00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.650
to cooperate with the drug enforcement.

00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:24.250
The provincial task force

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:24.980
is on its way

00:10:25.030 --> 00:10:25.980
and will be here soon.

00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.010
We must eradicate all new drugs

00:10:28.440 --> 00:10:30.530
as quickly as possible.

00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:31.370
Yes.

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:48.340
Guys,

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:50.370
Cao Liangsheng, captain of the

00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:52.700
Provincial Narcotics Control Bureau,

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.490
is in charge of this case.

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.530
Mr. Cao, please.

00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.060
Given that this case

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:02.490
involves several

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:03.610
major criminal cases

00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.460
and is also related to drugs,

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:07.890
the Provincial Bureau has decided to
establish a special task force

00:11:08.030 --> 00:11:10.060
to conduct a joint investigation.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:11.490
Lixing,

00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:12.850
please tell us

00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:13.940
about what you know.

00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:14.420
Okay.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:16.980
There is a drug dealer

00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.340
in Decang City

00:11:18.480 --> 00:11:19.340
named Nuo Sha.

00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:20.490
His real name is Zhang Fu.

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:21.820
Everyone calls him General.

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:23.610
He is very mysterious

00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:24.700
because no one

00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:26.340
has ever seen

00:11:26.360 --> 00:11:27.250
his real face.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:28.820
He has been dealing drugs

00:11:28.870 --> 00:11:30.180
in Decang City since the 1970s.

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:31.730
But 20 years ago,

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.730
the police destroyed his
drug trafficking group.

00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.650
He fled abroad and disappeared.

00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.370
Six months ago,

00:11:36.390 --> 00:11:37.940
we received a report from an informant

00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:39.250
that Nuo Sha

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:40.610
would be active soon.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.340
Moreover, he has already

00:11:42.390 --> 00:11:43.420
sent people to He City.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.650
Have you found out their purpose

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:46.220
in coming here?

00:11:46.630 --> 00:11:47.850
It's highly likely that they

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:48.940
are dealing in this new drug.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:50.250
We've investigated many

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:51.370
traditional drug markets

00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:52.220
and found no trace

00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:53.730
of the new drug.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:55.370
We've found that the transaction

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.370
volume in traditional drug markets

00:11:57.390 --> 00:11:58.580
is decreasing sharply.

00:11:59.030 --> 00:12:00.180
That's all we know.

00:12:01.550 --> 00:12:01.980
Han Feng,

00:12:02.600 --> 00:12:03.610
provide an update on the

00:12:03.670 --> 00:12:04.250
situation in He City.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:06.460
We've discovered

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.220
that all the cases

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.180
involving the new drug

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:09.100
are connected

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:10.010
to criminal cases.

00:12:10.320 --> 00:12:11.770
In the 788 Bar stabbing case,

00:12:12.030 --> 00:12:13.300
the perpetrator, Li Yiqi,

00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:14.490
exhibited unusual behavior

00:12:14.510 --> 00:12:16.060
and phototaxis after using it.

00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:18.820
Next is the spider case

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:19.300
at Bat Cave.

00:12:19.480 --> 00:12:20.420
The perpetrator, Li Shuting,

00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:21.340
also exhibited

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.530
the same phototaxis.

00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.370
Li Shuting had consulted

00:12:24.390 --> 00:12:25.940
a psychiatric clinic a year ago

00:12:26.030 --> 00:12:27.730
and was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:28.980
Her method of murder

00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.700
mimicked a spider's predation.

00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.010
Then there's the Donghu
double homicide case.

00:12:33.150 --> 00:12:34.130
The victim, Song Weimin,

00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:35.650
also exhibited phototaxis.

00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:36.650
Following this lead,

00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:37.940
we located the clinic

00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:38.850
of Chen Chuchuan

00:12:39.270 --> 00:12:40.650
and discovered that the

00:12:40.670 --> 00:12:41.490
medications he prescribed

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:43.700
contained components of this new drug.

00:12:44.120 --> 00:12:45.100
Currently, this component

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:46.180
is still experimental

00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.180
and has not been widely
distributed on the market.

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.370
All of these patients

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:50.300
suffer

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:51.770
from mental illnesses.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.490
Nuo Sha's sudden action indicates

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:55.580
that the deployment

00:12:55.630 --> 00:12:56.980
and trafficking of this
new drug has begun.

00:12:57.390 --> 00:12:57.850
We need

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:58.820
to find the source

00:12:58.840 --> 00:12:59.820
of these drugs as soon as possible.

00:13:00.670 --> 00:13:01.060
Mr. Qi,

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.580
tell us more

00:13:02.790 --> 00:13:03.770
about this new drug.

00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:04.250
Yes.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:06.980
We deduced the evolution

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.130
and development

00:13:08.270 --> 00:13:09.060
of the new drug

00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:09.940
from previous

00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:11.100
related cases.

00:13:11.630 --> 00:13:12.370
We found

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:13.890
that as the

00:13:13.910 --> 00:13:14.730
new drug evolves,

00:13:14.910 --> 00:13:16.130
the symptoms of users

00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.220
also change.

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:18.890
But one thing is common.

00:13:19.270 --> 00:13:20.890
They experience a blissful feeling

00:13:21.080 --> 00:13:22.730
in the initial stages

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:23.770
of use.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:25.730
However, as the dosage increases,

00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.700
they gradually begin

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:28.730
to experience hallucinations

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:30.100
and feelings of fear.

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.890
Ultimately, they become addicted,

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:34.180
leading to self-harm
and violent behavior.

00:13:34.510 --> 00:13:35.100
These drugs

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:36.530
are constantly evolving,

00:13:36.910 --> 00:13:38.700
but their origin is consistent.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.010
These drugs

00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:41.460
are likely experimental.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:42.530
This origin is

00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:44.490
the same as Raw Diamond.

00:13:45.840 --> 00:13:46.820
We have confirmed

00:13:47.080 --> 00:13:48.460
that the new drug and Raw Diamond

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:49.940
are identical

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:52.250
in their core atomic components.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.340
If it is an upgraded
version of Raw Diamond,

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:58.420
the situation will become more serious.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:13:59.850
Ms. Zhu,

00:14:00.670 --> 00:14:02.610
what leads

00:14:02.790 --> 00:14:03.940
do you have

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:04.770
on the suspect,

00:14:05.080 --> 00:14:05.770
Wang Bo?

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:07.180
We're all set up.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:08.700
We believe we'll catch him soon.

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:11.980
Do you have

00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:12.610
anything to add?

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:13.730
We found

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:15.010
a body this morning.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:16.220
The deceased died

00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:17.370
from having his neck broken.

00:14:17.550 --> 00:14:18.850
We found some white powder

00:14:18.870 --> 00:14:19.610
at the scene.

00:14:19.790 --> 00:14:20.700
This powder contains

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.530
small amounts

00:14:21.550 --> 00:14:23.100
of components of the new drug.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:24.460
Based on the surveillance footage,

00:14:24.550 --> 00:14:25.820
we got the murderer's face.

00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:28.300
Biao.

00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:30.460
He's one of Nuo Sha's henchmen.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:31.940
He's been active on the border.

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.060
It seems Nuo Sha

00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:35.180
has started making moves.

00:14:48.150 --> 00:14:49.180
I misjudged

00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.130
the Raw Diamond case.

00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:58.130
Now that

00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.130
we've confirmed

00:15:00.790 --> 00:15:01.940
Raw Diamond isn't over,

00:15:02.960 --> 00:15:03.940
let's investigate

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.490
and find the real murderer of Fei.

00:15:09.550 --> 00:15:10.250
This time,

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:12.890
we must catch him.

00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.530
According to our investigation,

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:23.650
Biao has an accomplice.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:25.180
They are hiding in this building.

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:32.420
Ms. Zhu,

00:15:32.670 --> 00:15:33.980
Biao went in your direction.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:40.890
Su and I will handle him.

00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:42.250
Go get the other one.

00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:44.220
Roger.

00:16:14.270 --> 00:16:15.130
Ms. Zhu, Biao is

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:16.060
trying to run!

00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:17.300
Stop!

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:22.370
Move!

00:16:42.670 --> 00:16:43.130
Trying to run?

00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:44.180
Keep running.

00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:56.250
Come on.

00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:23.090
Police. Don't move!

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.730
Stop!

00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:27.050
Lie down.

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:28.090
On your knees!

00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:33.980
Trying to destroy evidence?

00:17:38.240 --> 00:17:39.330
I'll kill you.

00:17:48.240 --> 00:17:48.490
Come on.

00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:48.940
Come on.

00:17:49.110 --> 00:17:49.460
Come on.

00:17:58.310 --> 00:17:59.050
Not moving now?

00:18:00.750 --> 00:18:01.420
Trying to kill me?

00:18:07.550 --> 00:18:07.940
Take him away.

00:18:15.070 --> 00:18:15.660
Mr. Han. Mr. Han.

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:16.460
Are you alright?

00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:17.460
Yeah.

00:18:17.480 --> 00:18:17.940
Where's Wu Ya?

00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:18.700
In the back.

00:18:21.790 --> 00:18:22.180
Sit still.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:23.460
Behave yourself.

00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:24.140
Come on.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:24.900
Let's go back.

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:36.770
Do you know him?

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:41.010
You killed him, right?

00:18:44.550 --> 00:18:45.530
Do you know this guy?

00:18:46.510 --> 00:18:47.420
Did you kill him?

00:18:49.960 --> 00:18:52.050
You've been here for a week
and you've already killed a man.

00:18:52.550 --> 00:18:53.140
Do you think

00:18:53.160 --> 00:18:54.420
this is Decang City?

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:57.180
I don't know anything.

00:18:58.000 --> 00:18:58.530
Don't know?

00:19:02.590 --> 00:19:03.570
Watch this video.

00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:05.810
Is that you in the video?

00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:07.900
Why did you kill him?

00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:11.900
When we caught you,

00:19:11.920 --> 00:19:13.090
we found a large quantity of drugs.

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.290
Do you know what the penalty is

00:19:15.310 --> 00:19:16.420
for carrying so many drugs here?

00:19:17.070 --> 00:19:17.420
According

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.900
to Article 348 of the Criminal Law of

00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:20.250
the People's Republic of China,

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.090
anyone illegally possessing more

00:19:22.110 --> 00:19:23.180
than one kilogram of opium,

00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:25.250
more than 50 grams of heroin

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:26.220
or methamphetamine,

00:19:26.350 --> 00:19:27.980
or other drugs shall be sentenced

00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:29.900
to not less than seven years

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:30.860
or life imprisonment

00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:32.010
and shall also be fined.

00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:36.330
Think about the consequences.

00:19:38.110 --> 00:19:38.980
Consequences?

00:19:39.750 --> 00:19:40.620
What consequences?

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:43.660
I'm unlucky to have been caught

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.460
by you this time.

00:19:46.270 --> 00:19:47.180
But it's okay.

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:49.140
I'll still be a hero

00:19:49.680 --> 00:19:51.570
in my next life.

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.810
Yeah.

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:54.570
It's okay.

00:19:55.310 --> 00:19:56.090
Even if you don't tell,

00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.420
Wu Ya will.

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:00.180
You might not know

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.460
my relationship with Biao.

00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:02.980
We're friends who have

00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.380
gone through death together.

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:07.700
He would never betray me.

00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:28.620
Biao told us

00:20:29.640 --> 00:20:30.220
he went out

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:31.660
to buy medicine for you.

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:35.660
He told us a lot of things about you.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.220
Do you want to know?

00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:42.220
Wu Ya

00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:44.090
told you?

00:20:45.510 --> 00:20:46.460
How would we know

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:47.940
such private matters

00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:49.220
if Wu Ya didn't tell us?

00:20:51.590 --> 00:20:52.050
Biao,

00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:53.620
think about it.

00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.290
If you don't confess,

00:20:55.480 --> 00:20:56.620
Wu Ya will confess everything.

00:20:57.480 --> 00:20:58.090
Then you'll face

00:20:58.110 --> 00:20:59.180
legal consequences.

00:21:00.590 --> 00:21:01.180
We're giving you

00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:02.180
one last chance.

00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:04.460
Confess or not?

00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.620
Stop! Stop!

00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.090
Stop!

00:21:20.510 --> 00:21:20.900
Alright.

00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:22.940
I'll confess.

00:21:35.270 --> 00:21:36.180
We came

00:21:36.830 --> 00:21:37.620
to He City

00:21:39.030 --> 00:21:40.660
to find a new drug.

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.420
Someone said he has it.

00:21:53.590 --> 00:21:54.050
Where is it?

00:22:07.070 --> 00:22:07.900
This isn't what I wanted.

00:22:09.510 --> 00:22:10.530
I don't care

00:22:10.550 --> 00:22:11.290
if it is.

00:22:11.750 --> 00:22:12.900
You said you wanted to buy it,

00:22:13.070 --> 00:22:13.900
so give me money.

00:22:17.070 --> 00:22:17.380
Come on,

00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:18.290
money.

00:22:28.510 --> 00:22:29.290
That's more like it.

00:22:36.550 --> 00:22:37.810
We're new here.

00:22:39.200 --> 00:22:40.090
I didn't want to cause trouble.

00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:42.180
But Biao couldn't

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:44.140
control his temper.

00:22:51.550 --> 00:22:54.420
People like that shouldn't be alive.

00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:57.420
I...

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:05.420
We really came here

00:23:07.510 --> 00:23:09.250
for a new drug.

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:14.380
Traditional drugs are
high-risk and low-profit.

00:23:15.070 --> 00:23:16.220
General hasn't dealt with them

00:23:16.270 --> 00:23:16.940
in a long time.

00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:18.730
Half a year ago,

00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:20.050
someone told him

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:22.220
that He City had a new drug,

00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.620
rumored to be stronger than Raw Diamond.

00:23:29.350 --> 00:23:30.090
Is this it?

00:23:37.310 --> 00:23:38.380
Yes.

00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:40.620
I've tried it.

00:23:42.640 --> 00:23:43.460
After taking it,

00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.570
you can't remember any

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:48.660
of your troubles.

00:23:49.510 --> 00:23:50.770
The most amazing thing is...

00:23:51.030 --> 00:23:51.810
Do you

00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:54.290
remember

00:23:54.310 --> 00:23:55.460
the happiest time

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.330
of your life?

00:23:56.510 --> 00:23:57.220
Focus!

00:23:58.270 --> 00:23:59.460
Tell us your next plan.

00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:02.730
General originally wanted us

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:04.770
to find someone who runs

00:24:05.350 --> 00:24:06.380
a mental health clinic

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.010
and has a medical background.

00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:11.250
He said he had the stuff we wanted.

00:24:12.510 --> 00:24:14.330
But we called for two days

00:24:15.110 --> 00:24:16.140
and no one answered.

00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:17.940
Why him?

00:24:20.590 --> 00:24:21.940
What else do you know

00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:24.570
about him?

00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:36.420
General only said

00:24:37.510 --> 00:24:39.460
that Cha Kun and Mr. K

00:24:40.110 --> 00:24:41.530
were killed by the police back then,

00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:43.490
so this new drug must

00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:46.810
be made by a more

00:24:46.830 --> 00:24:47.860
skilled drug maker.

00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:06.090
We're not sure

00:25:06.110 --> 00:25:07.490
yet if this is Chen Chuchuan.

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:08.490
He will figure it out.

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:17.570
General told us

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:20.050
to find someone

00:25:20.270 --> 00:25:21.090
named A She.

00:25:21.480 --> 00:25:22.180
A She?

00:25:23.590 --> 00:25:25.250
Does A She know who
the new drug maker is?

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:27.700
I don't know.

00:25:28.830 --> 00:25:29.660
General just wanted us

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:32.090
to make a deal with A She.

00:25:33.110 --> 00:25:34.380
How do you plan to make the deal?

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:39.620
Take the reduced sentence chance.

00:25:56.510 --> 00:25:57.660
The day after tomorrow at 9 PM.

00:26:00.830 --> 00:26:01.810
The location

00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:04.770
is Dongxiang Village.

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:07.460
Mr. Bai,

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:09.140
only Shan Yuanyang and Guan Lixing

00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:10.380
from the Drug Enforcement Unit

00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:11.900
were included in the task force.

00:26:12.270 --> 00:26:13.050
However, Guan Lixing

00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:13.940
went undercover

00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.290
in Decang City three years ago.

00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:17.090
Nuo Sha's men have all seen him.

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:19.010
He can't go this time.

00:26:19.310 --> 00:26:20.050
And Shan has no

00:26:20.310 --> 00:26:21.530
experience in undercover work.

00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:23.620
Mr. Bai,

00:26:23.960 --> 00:26:25.090
so I hope Mr. Han

00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.330
can assist us this time by posing

00:26:27.480 --> 00:26:29.330
as a drug dealer for a transaction.

00:26:31.590 --> 00:26:32.860
Han Feng was a good narcotics officer

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:34.380
before joining the
criminal investigation team.

00:26:35.720 --> 00:26:36.220
Han Feng,

00:26:37.310 --> 00:26:38.660
assist the Drug Enforcement Unit.

00:26:39.440 --> 00:26:39.770
Yes.

00:26:48.350 --> 00:26:48.900
People

00:26:49.510 --> 00:26:50.330
change.

00:26:51.510 --> 00:26:52.490
He would.

00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:54.180
You would.

00:26:56.270 --> 00:26:57.010
I would too.

00:26:58.270 --> 00:26:59.620
If this new drug you're talking

00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:00.490
about could

00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:03.180
let you see Yu Fei,

00:27:04.110 --> 00:27:04.980
do you think you could

00:27:05.030 --> 00:27:06.530
resist the temptation?

00:27:09.510 --> 00:27:10.250
It's all in the past.

00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.570
This is over

00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:14.770
for both you

00:27:15.590 --> 00:27:16.620
and Yu Fei.

00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:19.420
(Chen,)

00:27:20.550 --> 00:27:21.730
(did you make this new drug?)

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:48.530
Feng.

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:54.980
These three buckets contain

00:28:55.480 --> 00:28:57.180
several pigs that have been

00:28:57.310 --> 00:28:59.220
dead for different numbers of days.

00:28:59.830 --> 00:29:01.050
Your assignment today

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:02.490
is to identify

00:29:02.750 --> 00:29:03.900
how many pigs are

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:05.980
in these three buckets in total.

00:29:07.350 --> 00:29:08.570
You also need to tell me

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:09.770
how many days

00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:11.620
each pig has been dead.

00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:13.660
You all say you want to be

00:29:13.680 --> 00:29:14.730
excellent forensic pathologists.

00:29:15.270 --> 00:29:16.570
But a real forensic pathologist

00:29:16.830 --> 00:29:18.660
doesn't just dissect corpses

00:29:18.680 --> 00:29:19.570
in the autopsy room.

00:29:20.270 --> 00:29:21.330
Going to crime scenes

00:29:21.590 --> 00:29:23.050
is also an essential part

00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:24.900
of the work.

00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:26.660
Okay.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.140
Who wants to start?

00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:53.660
Prof. Qi.

00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.620
This is today's assignment report.

00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:01.050
There are four pigs in these buckets.

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:02.530
They died two weeks, ten days,

00:30:02.550 --> 00:30:04.660
and three days ago, respectively.

00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.250
One of them

00:30:06.680 --> 00:30:08.380
was probably slaughtered this morning.

00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.620
I also noticed

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:13.660
that three of them are white-haired,

00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:15.290
and one is black-haired.

00:30:15.920 --> 00:30:17.810
Judging from the marks on them,

00:30:18.240 --> 00:30:19.220
you probably

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.250
bought them

00:30:20.270 --> 00:30:21.250
from three different places.

00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:29.330
Yu Fei,

00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.940
how did you figure that out?

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:35.700
You can tell from their

00:30:35.720 --> 00:30:36.530
chopping techniques.

00:30:37.070 --> 00:30:37.730
It's clearly

00:30:37.790 --> 00:30:39.250
not the same method

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.180
of chopping meat.

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:44.940
You're very observant.

00:30:45.590 --> 00:30:46.570
Thank you, Professor.

00:30:47.750 --> 00:30:48.980
But actually,

00:30:50.590 --> 00:30:51.290
all these pigs

00:30:51.310 --> 00:30:52.380
were bought from the

00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:53.010
same place.

00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:55.660
I asked the butcher

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.530
to use different methods and techniques

00:30:57.550 --> 00:30:58.090
to chop them.

00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.460
Don't be discouraged.

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:08.250
Because you're the only one

00:31:08.270 --> 00:31:09.460
who discovered

00:31:09.480 --> 00:31:10.220
that I had set

00:31:10.240 --> 00:31:11.460
up this clue.

00:31:12.550 --> 00:31:13.660
I believe you will become

00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:15.140
a good forensic pathologist someday.

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:17.530
Someday?

00:31:18.310 --> 00:31:19.770
So you're not going to listen to his

00:31:19.790 --> 00:31:20.490
advice to ask me to quit?

00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:24.330
Sizhe!

00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:30.810
Han Feng?

00:31:34.070 --> 00:31:34.940
What are you doing here?

00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:35.980
What are you doing here?

00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.380
I'm here to teach a class.

00:31:37.790 --> 00:31:38.460
What class?

00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:39.490
I'm a visiting professor

00:31:39.510 --> 00:31:40.620
of forensic medicine here.

00:31:41.720 --> 00:31:42.490
But what's a

00:31:43.030 --> 00:31:43.810
police officer like you

00:31:44.200 --> 00:31:45.220
doing at the university?

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.570
Visiting professor of forensic medicine?

00:31:48.920 --> 00:31:50.700
Do you know a girl

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:52.290
named Yu Fei?

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:54.660
You know Yu Fei?

00:31:55.510 --> 00:31:56.140
Great.

00:31:56.590 --> 00:31:57.810
You have to help me with this.

00:31:59.680 --> 00:32:01.050
You can't let Yu Fei

00:32:01.070 --> 00:32:02.420
like forensic medicine.

00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:02.940
Wait.

00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:05.180
What? Why?

00:32:08.110 --> 00:32:09.570
He asked you to persuade
me to quit, right?

00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:11.420
He just can't

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:13.050
keep secrets.

00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.330
He's been all smiles ever
since he came back

00:32:15.350 --> 00:32:16.490
from school that day.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:17.980
Plus, with your background,

00:32:18.510 --> 00:32:20.140
I could guess you know him even

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.620
without you saying anything.

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:24.980
Yu Fei,

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:27.620
you are

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:29.570
really observant.

00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:30.770
So please,

00:32:30.790 --> 00:32:31.660
don't listen to him.

00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:34.940
If I can't continue my studies,

00:32:35.590 --> 00:32:36.900
the forensic field will lose

00:32:37.270 --> 00:32:38.090
a valuable talent

00:32:38.110 --> 00:32:39.090
like me.

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:40.810
You're confident.

00:32:44.070 --> 00:32:44.570
Yu Fei,

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:46.250
let me ask you.

00:32:47.510 --> 00:32:48.330
Why do you want to be

00:32:48.350 --> 00:32:49.250
a forensic pathologist?

00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:53.900
I want to find the truth

00:32:54.830 --> 00:32:56.090
for those

00:32:56.110 --> 00:32:56.900
who can't speak,

00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:59.290
so they can

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:01.250
rest in peace.

00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:04.250
Fei,

00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:07.460
if I had listened to Han Feng

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.250
and asked you to quit,

00:33:13.110 --> 00:33:14.010
if I had

00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:16.660
received your call

00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:17.700
sooner that day,

00:33:19.920 --> 00:33:21.010
if I had found you sooner…

00:33:45.030 --> 00:33:45.530
Fei.

00:33:47.270 --> 00:33:47.810
Fei.

00:33:48.920 --> 00:33:49.660
Are you hurt?

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:51.290
What happened?

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:03.700
I didn't protect you.

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.690
Fei,

00:34:13.480 --> 00:34:15.130
I will definitely find the truth

00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:17.340
for you and put an end

00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:21.090
to this case.

00:34:47.070 --> 00:34:48.260
We've just located

00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:48.980
Wang Bo.

00:34:49.480 --> 00:34:50.090
Ms. Zhu, Su,

00:34:50.590 --> 00:34:51.650
proceed with the arrest.

00:34:52.110 --> 00:34:52.650
Yes, sir.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:53.300
Han Feng,

00:34:53.710 --> 00:34:54.820
take Wu Ya to make

00:34:54.880 --> 00:34:56.380
the deal with the drug dealers.

00:34:57.110 --> 00:34:57.420
Mr. Guan,

00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:59.050
lead the rest

00:34:59.150 --> 00:35:00.460
as the advance team.

00:35:01.510 --> 00:35:01.980
Guys,

00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:03.210
be careful.

00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:04.090
Go.

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.170
Where's Qi Sizhe?

00:35:42.710 --> 00:35:43.490
Cooperate with us.

00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:44.460
Don't try anything.

00:35:44.510 --> 00:35:45.380
Let me introduce him.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.900
This is Mr. Meng.

00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.860
If you want to make money,

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.820
let me meet the drug maker.

00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.530
You lied to me?

00:35:51.670 --> 00:35:53.090
Don't fucking try to scam me!

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:54.900
You think we can't find
out if you don't tell us?

00:35:55.000 --> 00:35:56.650
You'd better explain everything clearly.

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:58.210
Hydrofluoric acid

00:35:58.280 --> 00:35:59.780
is usually processed and manufactured

00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:00.940
in glass factories.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:01.900
Attention,

00:36:02.030 --> 00:36:02.740
get ready.

00:36:08.550 --> 00:36:09.170
Stop!

00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.010
Watch out!

00:36:13.590 --> 00:36:14.490
Ms. Zhu!
