00:01:04.560 --> 00:01:05.710
Why would the head of a bank

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:07.680
visit a lady's room at midnight

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.280
and help her frame the General's wife?

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.710
I had no idea

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:14.790
where you hid that silver
you took in secret.

00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:16.710
But last night,

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:18.120
you were acting guilty.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.680
You wanted to retrieve the deposit slip.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.120
But once you realized
I was following you,

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:23.310
you set me up.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:25.120
Though I managed to escape,

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:26.560
I left behind a sachet.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.350
You seized the chance
to stir up trouble,

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.230
spreading rumors that I was cheating.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.200
But you never knew
I'd turned him to my side.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:34.190
Today,

00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.070
he went to give Mr. Liu a false report.

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.790
That's why he came here
to meet with you.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:42.630
Concubine Qin,

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.280
the more secrets you try to hide,

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:48.230
the more flaws will show.

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:49.430
Stop framing me!

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.230
You

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.070
had an affair with Erlang.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:55.040
You two plotted together to set me up.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:56.270
Erlang?

00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.510
Who's Erlang?

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:01.920
I...

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.200
How would you know he's Erlang?

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:07.070
You're acquainted with the head

00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.960
and the accounts clerk of Yongle Bank.

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:11.360
Doesn't that mean you're admitting

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.150
the money that was skimmed off

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:14.960
is sitting right in Yongle Bank?

00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:17.800
Your sharp tongue always bests me.

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:19.680
But don't think you can frame me.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.750
I say there's nothing, and that's it.

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:23.430
And you?

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:26.000
She has nothing to do with you?

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.840
Of course I have
no other dealings with her.

00:02:29.030 --> 00:02:31.360
Concubine Qin
only stored some money with me.

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.080
Don't frame me.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:34.870
Fine.

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.680
Guards.

00:02:38.470 --> 00:02:40.240
Do you know what the law says

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.680
about sneaking
into the Marquis' Manor at night.

00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.800
I... I don't know.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:46.750
The General holds a crucial post.

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:49.750
The Marquis' Manor holds many secrets.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:52.000
If it were tried as treason,

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:55.030
that'd mean death by slow slicing.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:02:57.960
Or,

00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.000
if you wanted to harm
the General's wife,

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.680
by law, that's execution
by dismemberment.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:08.470
You still refuse to tell the truth?

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.310
This is coercion!

00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:18.960
I... I...

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.560
I'll talk.

00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:22.870
It was...

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:43.150
The rashes...

00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:45.910
The coroner has confirmed the cause.

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.750
Your mother was poisoned first,

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.360
then someone cut her throat.

00:04:03.030 --> 00:04:03.870
Qin Ruoyi,

00:04:04.590 --> 00:04:05.710
was it you who poisoned?

00:04:06.470 --> 00:04:07.310
No.

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:09.280
It wasn't me.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.750
I swear it wasn't me.

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:12.310
Yaochu.

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.870
These banknotes and receipts are forged.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.440
It wasn't me.

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:32.750
It truly wasn't me.

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:34.840
I...

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:50.790
Yaochu.

00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.560
What happened to you?

00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.270
Madam, why have you come out?

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:25.480
The medicine is ready.

00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:27.630
Please drink it while it's still warm.

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:28.840
Where did this come from?

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:30.560
After you fainted last night,

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.630
you remained unconscious.

00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.600
The General said your worries
have made you ill,

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.560
and you have grown weak.

00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:37.920
So he rushed to Jishi Temple overnight

00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.040
and prayed for this medicine.

00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.720
It's priceless.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.320
General.

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:52.600
It's an ordinary medicine.

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.310
Drink it before it cools.

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:55.960
Thank you, General.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:58.590
General,

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.630
my mother's death might
have something

00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:03.430
to do with the people of Li Manor.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:07.830
Last night, Mr. Liu died suddenly.

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:10.510
The way he died was similar
to my mother's.

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.190
The only one who benefited
was Qin Ruoyi.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:16.270
I did suspect her before.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:18.480
But she bore no grudge
against my mother.

00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:20.430
So why would she do such a thing?

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.200
Shen Yaochu.

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.110
I told you

00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.120
I'd look into this matter.

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:46.040
I must investigate too.

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:48.510
You know this person
is skilled in poisons.

00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:49.600
So you should stay away,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:51.920
or you're only putting yourself
in danger.

00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:54.000
Will I be safer if I don't investigate?

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:55.680
The killer

00:06:55.680 --> 00:06:56.920
was coming after me.

00:07:01.390 --> 00:07:02.750
Madam, that's wonderful news!

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:03.590
Madam...

00:07:06.190 --> 00:07:07.750
Madam, something terrible has happened.

00:07:07.750 --> 00:07:08.930
Concubine Qin tried to hang herself.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.040
Then why are you smiling?

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.110
Because I'm happy.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:19.120
Please don't lose hope.

00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.510
- Let me go!
- They're framing you!

00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:22.480
- Don't stop me!
- Why seek death over this?

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:24.040
The Old Madam no longer trusts me.

00:07:24.270 --> 00:07:25.160
The General doesn't trust me.

00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:26.630
That makes me feel tainted.

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:28.160
There's no such thing as being framed.

00:07:28.430 --> 00:07:29.270
Today,

00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:32.070
I'll prove my innocence with my death!

00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:34.560
Madam!

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.760
Stop this!

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.950
I've had the matter investigated.

00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.160
You are innocent.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.720
No one will dare wrong you again.

00:07:42.040 --> 00:07:43.000
Come down.

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:44.950
But... Mr. Liu is already dead.

00:07:45.190 --> 00:07:46.800
Which means there's no testimony left.

00:07:47.310 --> 00:07:49.390
I have no way

00:07:49.390 --> 00:07:50.750
to clear my name.

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:54.120
I'd rather die than live on in disgrace,

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.360
being talked about like this!

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:01.590
Madam!

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.640
General.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.480
You believe me,

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:19.590
don't you?

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:21.430
This matter is still unproven.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:22.920
We can't draw a conclusion.

00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:25.000
Ruoyi remains a concubine.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.830
Anyone daring to speak recklessly
of this will be

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.720
punished with twenty strikes.

00:09:00.750 --> 00:09:01.590
Any leads yet?

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.120
The poison was administered to Mr. Liu

00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:05.120
two hours before his death.

00:09:05.910 --> 00:09:06.910
But at that time,

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.750
he had contact with far too many people.

00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:10.870
The body has been taken over
by Shuntian Prefecture.

00:09:10.870 --> 00:09:12.480
It's not convenient for me to intervene.

00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:14.280
You handle it.

00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.870
All questioning stops at the gates.

00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:17.200
I'll manage matters inside the manor.

00:09:17.550 --> 00:09:18.390
Yes.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:19.440
Wait.

00:09:22.030 --> 00:09:23.320
Madam has already rested.

00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:25.510
(Shen Yaochu.)

00:09:26.750 --> 00:09:28.440
(Do you truly not care at all?)

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:31.440
Why still stand there? Go!

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:41.500
(Li Manor)

00:09:53.840 --> 00:09:54.680
Concubine Qin.

00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:55.960
Concubine Qin.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:57.110
What's wrong with you?

00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:01.630
I'm not sure.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.320
Ever since the general

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.750
favored me a month ago,

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:06.910
I've felt weary all over.

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:08.090
My back aches and my waist feels sore.

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:09.600
Thought it was because...

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.080
Because the General
had exceptional stamina.

00:10:18.790 --> 00:10:20.240
But now, a whole month has passed,

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:21.320
and there's no improvement.

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:22.870
Lately, I don't know why,

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:23.840
but I've been feeling

00:10:25.390 --> 00:10:27.480
weak all over, with no appetite.

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.870
Are there any other symptoms?

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:31.390
Like unusually sleepy.

00:10:32.780 --> 00:10:33.630
Yes, exactly.

00:10:33.630 --> 00:10:34.960
Wan'er, how do you know that?

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:38.080
Could it be that
I have some grave illness?

00:10:40.510 --> 00:10:42.360
Back when I was living on the estate,

00:10:42.870 --> 00:10:45.550
I happened to see the steward Shunzi's wife
expecting a child.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.390
Her symptoms were
exactly the same as yours.

00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:52.670
You might be pregnant.

00:10:54.550 --> 00:10:55.390
Really?

00:10:57.840 --> 00:10:59.510
That day was only just over a month ago.

00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:01.840
Your morning sickness
is already this severe?

00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.960
Everyone's constitution is different.

00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:06.720
We can't generalize like that.

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:10.120
Let's get a physician
to take a look at her.

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:11.840
Yes.

00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.270
Physician Zhang, what do you think?

00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.240
Congratulations, Old Madam.

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.840
Although Concubine Qin's pulse
is still faint,

00:11:34.030 --> 00:11:35.910
it can be basically confirmed

00:11:36.120 --> 00:11:37.510
that she is indeed pregnant.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.550
Thanks, Physician Zhang.

00:11:46.670 --> 00:11:47.840
I truly didn't expect this.

00:11:48.270 --> 00:11:49.910
Madam has served the General
for so long,

00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:51.360
yet she's not pregnant.

00:11:51.720 --> 00:11:53.960
And now I'm the one carrying
the General's child first.

00:11:54.540 --> 00:11:55.390
It seems

00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:58.240
fate wants me to have the eldest kid
of the Li family.

00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:01.720
Madam, you won't be upset, will you?

00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:07.630
After all, it's the General's child.

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:09.200
Even if born of a concubine,

00:12:09.440 --> 00:12:10.750
they will still call me Mother.

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:12.720
How could I be unhappy?

00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:14.750
Even as a kid born of concubine,

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:16.910
he is still the eldest kid
of the Li family.
