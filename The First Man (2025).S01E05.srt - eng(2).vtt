WEBVTT

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.330
Ok Hee, Tok Hee.

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.930
I'm so sorry you were both born
as my daughters.

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.540
But still, please be happy.

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.340
Live a long and happy life.

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:36.310
Promise me...

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:38.540
you'll live a good life.

00:01:41.140 --> 00:01:43.680
(Episode 5)

00:01:57.820 --> 00:01:59.290
Let's get out.

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.400
Dad, I don't want any of those rice cakes.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:16.070
What makes you think
I bought these for you?

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.780
I bought them for the caretaker here.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.280
- Why?
- "Why?"

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.310
Suk Hee was staying here, wasn't she?

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.980
It's just common courtesy
to show our gratitude.

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.950
- "Courtesy?"
- Yes.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:33.690
It just means you can't just accept
anything for free.

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:42.370
Where is that cat meowing from?

00:02:42.430 --> 00:02:44.840
Dad, I want to go play with the cat.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:46.070
What?

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:48.510
All right. Should we go check it out?

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:50.280
Let's go.

00:02:55.450 --> 00:02:56.450
What?

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:58.480
That doesn't sound like a cat.

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.530
Wait, why is there a baby here?

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:11.730
What in the world is going on?

00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:17.500
Goodness. Let's see.

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.840
What's a baby doing here?

00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.740
Where's your mommy?
Why are you out here crying?

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.610
This is the four-leaf clover
Suk Hee crocheted.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:30.010
What?

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.080
This is exactly like mine.

00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.790
Dad, it's just like yours, too!

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.460
Bok Gil.

00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.890
I hesitated whether
I should tell you this or not...

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:43.600
for a long time.

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:48.330
There's something that will be
a big surprise for you later.

00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:51.440
She's so beautiful that
I want to brag about her,

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.370
but I'll stop myself.

00:03:54.310 --> 00:03:57.240
Then could this be the big surprise
she mentioned?

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.840
Does it mean she had this baby?

00:04:01.910 --> 00:04:03.180
"She's so beautiful that
I want to brag..."

00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:05.820
She has to be hers.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.920
She has to be Suk Hee's baby!

00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:17.860
It's done.

00:04:19.430 --> 00:04:21.100
She went over with the baby,

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.770
so it's done and over with.

00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.840
Boss, can we take off now?

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.040
Go ahead.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.680
You cleaned the villa,
leaving no traces of us, right?

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.680
Yes, boss.

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:35.250
Hey. Didn't I tell you
not to drink on the job?

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.180
You made this a lot harder
than it should've been.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:41.790
Let's go.

00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:47.990
Suk Hee! Are you in there?

00:04:48.590 --> 00:04:50.130
Are you in there?

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:51.630
Suk Hee!

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.460
Are you in there?

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.600
Suk Hee!

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.540
Are you in there?

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:00.840
What on earth is going on here?

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.380
Well, if this is her baby,

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:06.210
she wouldn't be in the room...

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:08.550
with the baby alone in the shed.

00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:10.880
What is going on here?

00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.480
Oh, all right.

00:05:14.350 --> 00:05:17.560
Jung Suk Hee threw herself off a cliff?

00:05:18.460 --> 00:05:19.460
Yes.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.160
She was at a dead end anyway.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.800
What about the baby? The baby too?

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.870
She knew she had to take
the baby with her.

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:32.140
The baby would've had
a miserable life anyway.

00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.280
Right. It might be for the best.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:39.580
We didn't get blood on our hands.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:43.410
That's right. Our hands are clean.
We did nothing wrong.

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:46.420
It was Jung Suk Hee's choice to die.

00:05:47.550 --> 00:05:48.550
Right?

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:56.090
I'm telling you, Suk Hee was gone,
and only this baby was there.

00:05:56.160 --> 00:05:58.360
In a filthy shed, no less!

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.930
Please, you have to find Suk Hee.

00:06:00.030 --> 00:06:02.070
You need to find Suk Hee now!

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:03.770
I just spoke with the caretaker
of the villa,

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.800
and he said Ms. Jung Suk Hee
rented the place for a few months...

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:07.840
and has moved out.

00:06:08.610 --> 00:06:11.280
She moved out?
Leaving the baby behind?

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:16.010
Our records show that Ms. Jung Suk Hee
doesn't have any children.

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:17.580
Are you sure she has a daughter?

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:21.120
She's right here. Don't cry. It's okay.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:24.190
- If she left her child and vanished,
- What do you mean she left her child?

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.390
it looks more like she ran away
than went missing.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:28.860
It was probably too hard
for a single mother to raise a child.

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:30.360
That's ridiculous!

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.400
Suk Hee would never do that!

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:34.670
We'll call you if we hear anything,
so you can go home for now.

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:35.730
But I...

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:37.370
Yes, this is the Buho Police Substation.

00:06:38.340 --> 00:06:39.470
- What?
- It's okay.

00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.570
You're saying a fisherman
found a woman in the water?

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:44.740
A woman?

00:06:57.290 --> 00:06:58.960
Here, hold her.

00:07:08.700 --> 00:07:11.170
I'll pull the car around.
Take your time coming down.

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:19.280
From now on, no matter what anyone says,

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.350
you will live as my daughter.

00:07:22.150 --> 00:07:24.180
You'll forget all about your blood ties.

00:07:24.850 --> 00:07:26.220
You'll be my daughter
for the rest of your life.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:27.820
Got it?

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:33.260
Which baby...

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:35.490
should I take?

00:07:41.770 --> 00:07:43.730
All right. We're going to see
your grandfather now.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.470
And when we do,

00:07:46.170 --> 00:07:49.410
you'll get to live a life of luxury,
all thanks to me.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.240
So don't you ever cross me.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:54.180
You will be grateful...

00:07:54.810 --> 00:07:56.310
and do exactly as I say.

00:07:57.110 --> 00:07:58.120
Forever.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:02.850
Suk Hee! You guys stay here...

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:04.620
Suk Hee, it's me! I'm here!

00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.760
- I'm here, Suk Hee...
- Sir, please be quiet.

00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:08.360
Where is my Suk Hee?

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.130
Suk Hee!

00:08:10.130 --> 00:08:11.230
Suk Hee...

00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:13.130
Suk Hee!

00:08:16.770 --> 00:08:19.070
Suk Hee. What happened to you?

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:23.840
You were studying for the bar exam.
How'd you fall in the water to get here?

00:08:31.850 --> 00:08:32.850
Out of the way!

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:34.550
What? Okay.

00:08:35.950 --> 00:08:38.090
- She's in arrest.
- Prepare for CPR, now.

00:08:38.090 --> 00:08:39.160
Yes, Doctor.

00:08:42.290 --> 00:08:44.430
Suk Hee! Open your eyes!

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.760
You can't go like this.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:48.930
You've had a hard life with no parents,

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:50.270
so it's too unfair for you to die now.

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:53.100
You deserve to be successful for once.

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:54.970
That's why you studied so hard
for the bar exam!

00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:57.110
- Dad.
- Don't cry.

00:08:57.170 --> 00:08:58.440
Family members, please step back.

00:08:58.440 --> 00:08:59.480
Okay.

00:09:00.950 --> 00:09:01.950
Suk Hee!

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.320
No! Suk Hee!

00:09:05.050 --> 00:09:06.320
Father.

00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.720
She's your granddaughter.

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.720
She's my daughter with Dong Seok.

00:09:11.020 --> 00:09:12.090
I see.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.360
So you're Dong Seok's daughter.

00:09:16.360 --> 00:09:17.460
Hold her, Father.

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:19.860
All right.

00:09:20.670 --> 00:09:23.600
Oh, you're so pretty. Oh, my sweet girl.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:25.940
It feels like my Dong Seok
has come back to me.

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.410
- Father.
- Yes. All right...

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:33.240
- Oh, Suk Hee...
- Charge to 200 joules.

00:09:33.540 --> 00:09:34.550
Two hundred joules.

00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:38.320
Dad...

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.620
Suk Hee...

00:09:40.990 --> 00:09:41.990
Please...

00:09:42.620 --> 00:09:44.820
- Charge to 250 joules.
- Two hundred fifty joules.

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:45.890
Suk Hee...

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:49.160
Suk Hee.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:52.330
No.

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.930
- Suk Hee...
- No...

00:09:55.130 --> 00:09:56.130
Suk Hee.

00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:57.800
No.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:09:59.500
Suk Hee.

00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:04.610
Suk Hee, no!

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:17.860
I've never seen you this happy, Father.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.260
Is that so?

00:10:19.260 --> 00:10:22.230
I guess blood ties
really do pull you together.

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:25.500
Still, you should get a DNA test,
just to be sure.

00:10:26.330 --> 00:10:28.070
That way, I'll have a clear conscience.

00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.800
Of course. We have to.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:32.470
Don't worry.
I'm going to get the DNA test.

00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.370
Oh my, her hands are so tiny.

00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:40.850
Seo Rin, I'm your grandpa.

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.050
- Peekaboo.
- Seo Rin?

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:46.250
Yes. "Seo" means auspicious,
and "Rin" means jade.

00:10:46.250 --> 00:10:48.220
That's her name. What do you think?

00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:51.860
You've already picked out a name for her?

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:54.060
Ma Seo Rin.

00:10:55.860 --> 00:10:57.290
It's a beautiful name.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:59.800
You've been through so much.

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:04.100
Move into the house tomorrow with Seo Rin.

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:07.470
- Into the house?
- Why are you surprised?

00:11:08.070 --> 00:11:11.010
If you're Seo Rin's mother,
then you're my daughter-in-law.

00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.710
Move in and raise Seo Rin.

00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.580
I'll make that decision
after we get the DNA results, Father.

00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.380
Please, let me do it that way.

00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:27.630
All right.

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:31.230
Let me apologize
for how harshly I treated...

00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:33.030
you before.

00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:36.370
Thank you, Father.

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.500
I'll move in and make sure...

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.470

I'll do right by both her and Dong Seok.

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.180
All right, it's okay...

Suk Hee.

00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:58.790
All right. It's okay.

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:12.100
No, Suk Hee!

Her heart is beating!

Suk Hee's alive, right?

00:12:48.110 --> 00:12:49.910
She will make it, right?

00:12:50.070 --> 00:12:51.180
She's come back.

00:12:51.810 --> 00:12:53.110
Suk Hee, thank you.

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:54.410
Thank you, Suk Hee.

- Yes, we'll have one steak.

- And a tomato pasta, please.
- And one tomato pasta.

Is medium rare okay for the steak?

- Yes.
- All right.

You reserved a table by the window, right?

00:14:03.950 --> 00:14:05.750
Yes, right this way, please.

00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.770
Here's your basil shrimp cream pasta.

00:15:58.330 --> 00:15:59.330
Alright.

00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.940
Have a drink

00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.320
Dad? What is it?

00:16:22.850 --> 00:16:23.890
Aren't you going to work?

00:16:24.690 --> 00:16:28.530
I sent you out for eggs.
What are you doing, goofing off in here?

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:30.790
Alright, I'm going.

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.260
Darn it,
you scarfed down all the eggs, too.

00:16:34.770 --> 00:16:36.700
Your sister Jang Mi prepped
the shop earlier...

00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:38.240
and left for her part-time job.

00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:41.540
But you're just holed up inside,
stuffing your face with eggs...

00:16:41.540 --> 00:16:42.710
and fooling around!

00:16:42.710 --> 00:16:44.480
I only ate a few.

I was just doing my vocal warm-ups.

00:16:46.010 --> 00:16:47.410
You've got some nerve.

00:16:47.410 --> 00:16:48.750
When will you get your act together?

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:50.880
Gosh, my ears are ringing.

00:16:53.420 --> 00:16:54.620
Where's your mother?

00:16:54.890 --> 00:16:57.020
What? Isn't she at the store?

00:16:57.090 --> 00:16:59.990
She went out right after you left
to buy eggs to go with you.

00:16:59.990 --> 00:17:02.360
- I told her to go back in.
- But did you see her go in?

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:04.400
Isn't telling her enough?
Must I walk her in too?

00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.830
You and your mouth...

00:17:05.930 --> 00:17:07.460
- Dad, wait!
- Why, you little...

00:17:08.130 --> 00:17:09.170
Dad, calm down.

00:17:09.430 --> 00:17:10.730
Violence is not the answer.

00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:13.100
I'm about to lose it.

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.370
Go find your mother now!

00:17:15.870 --> 00:17:17.540
Hopefully, she's just at the supermarket.

00:17:17.540 --> 00:17:20.340
Otherwise, I have no idea where she'd go.

00:17:20.610 --> 00:17:22.680
All right, I'll go.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.350
Don't just say it and do it.

00:17:24.950 --> 00:17:26.820
And don't forget that
it's your mom's birthday tomorrow.

00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:28.320
All right!

00:17:29.920 --> 00:17:31.120
You're such a headache.

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:38.000
What should I get?

00:17:39.060 --> 00:17:42.900

for her birthday last year,

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:45.400

from the airport.

She'll be here.

00:19:41.450 --> 00:19:43.520

she'd attend the board meeting this time.

I spoiled her rotten, and now she thinks
she can do as she likes.

Please, try not to worry so much.

You're not home already, are you?

No. I've got a stop to make
before I head home.

Okay. Then get ready
for a surprise welcome home party.

00:21:42.770 --> 00:21:44.140
There will be lots of balloons.

- That kid.
- Was that your brother?

Yes.

He was going on
about a surprise party for me,

00:21:54.520 --> 00:21:57.350
and I knew he'd make Mom and Dad
blow up balloons, so I called.

And sure enough.

00:21:59.890 --> 00:22:01.860
Sounds like your brother is
nothing like you.

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:05.760
We're very different.
Other than being a handful,

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:08.330
he's bright, kind, and has a big heart.

00:22:08.900 --> 00:22:10.030
He's a good kid.

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:12.400
You're really singing his praises.

00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:15.310
I'm jealous.
I wish I had a brother like that.

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.740
It's just my mom and me,
so things get pretty dull.

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:21.010
Aren't you going home?
Your mom's probably waiting for you.

00:22:21.910 --> 00:22:22.910
I should get going.

Hey, Mom. You know Jun Ho's back, right?

00:22:59.420 --> 00:23:01.820
Yes, I heard earlier he was back for good.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:07.360
I don't know why he has to be so distant.

00:23:07.690 --> 00:23:11.600
He's so formal and distant,
it's hard to even call him my son.

You're home?

00:23:15.270 --> 00:23:17.100
Right, Baek Ho.
So you're coming home early?

00:23:18.070 --> 00:23:20.570
Good. Let's all have dinner together
for a change.

00:23:21.140 --> 00:23:22.210
Okay.

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:24.640
I didn't know you were home.

00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:27.610
My class was canceled,
so I wrapped up early and came home.

00:23:27.710 --> 00:23:29.580
By the way, Jun Ho is back.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.550
I know. He called me.

00:23:33.020 --> 00:23:35.690
Does this mean we have to
blow up balloons again?

00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:39.360
Baek Ho said he was coming home early
with a gift for his brother.

can be so completely different.

- For your mother?

That's beautiful.

What a freak.

00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:03.810
Why is a crazy person like you
wandering the streets?

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:06.240
If you're not all there,
you should be locked up at home.

00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:08.080
Why are you out here?

00:25:08.140 --> 00:25:11.950
I'm not crazy.
I'm looking for my Jang Mi.

00:25:13.650 --> 00:25:15.690
Have you seen my Jang Mi?

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:16.720
My Jang Mi.

00:25:16.790 --> 00:25:18.690
What do you think you're doing?

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:20.620
You're disgusting.

00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:22.530
I'm not disgusting!

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:24.900
I'm going to tell my Jang Mi on you.

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:28.000
You're mean. You're a mean lady.

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:30.170
I can't believe this woman.

00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:33.840
Hey, I didn't do anything to her! I swear!

00:25:33.900 --> 00:25:35.940
Yes, you did! You pushed me!

00:25:35.940 --> 00:25:37.640
You're a mean lady!

00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:39.180
You pushed me!

00:25:39.680 --> 00:25:42.110
You fell all by yourself!
Why are you blaming me?

00:25:42.110 --> 00:25:43.310
What a nutcase.

00:25:44.510 --> 00:25:46.620
What are you staring at?
You think this is a show?

00:25:46.820 --> 00:25:47.980
Jang Mi...

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:57.660
I just want to see my Jang Mi.

00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:01.900
Where is she?
Please, take me to my Jang Mi.

00:26:02.230 --> 00:26:03.870
- What's her problem?
- What's going on over there?

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:05.370
Will you get out of my way?

00:26:05.370 --> 00:26:07.540
You crazy old hag, what is wrong with you?

00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.110
Take me to my Jang Mi!

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.810
Jang Mi! Take me to her!

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:15.550
It looks like there was an accident.

00:26:15.610 --> 00:26:16.880
Let go of me.

00:26:17.610 --> 00:26:20.420
- I said let go.
- It looks like a fight's breaking out.

00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:23.220
I have to get to Jang Mi.

00:26:23.850 --> 00:26:26.560
- Take me to her! Please, take me.
- What is wrong with you?

00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:29.890
Take me to Jang Mi.

00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:33.230
- I said let go!
- Take me to Jang Mi.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:35.030
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:26:35.570 --> 00:26:36.570
Dad!

00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.970
Is Mom not back yet?

00:26:38.970 --> 00:26:41.170
You couldn't find her?
Did you look everywhere?

00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:42.270
I told you I did.

00:26:42.470 --> 00:26:44.640
- What are we going to do?
- Darn it.

00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:47.040
Hey! This is all on you!

00:26:47.310 --> 00:26:49.110
- What?
- Go find your mother right now!

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:52.650
Who are you calling?

00:26:52.780 --> 00:26:55.290
Don't call Jang Mi.
You'll just make her worry.

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:58.120
- Hey, Jang Mi. Mom's missing.
- Seriously, you!

00:26:58.120 --> 00:26:59.820
- I swear I told her to go inside.
- Give me that.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.160
- Hang on!
- You little punk!

00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.560
- Dad, wait!
- Tae Pyung.

00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.960
What did you say about Mom?

00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:08.330
What?
Don't tell me she got lost again.

00:27:08.770 --> 00:27:09.930
How could you let this happen?

00:27:09.930 --> 00:27:11.900
I thought I told you
not to let Mom go out alone!

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:26.580
She was at that park last time, remember?

00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:28.020
Go check there.

00:27:28.420 --> 00:27:29.520
I'm on my way.

00:27:32.660 --> 00:27:34.060
Call me if anything happens.

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.120
(Filming with newborns was conducted...)

00:28:08.190 --> 00:28:09.560
(under parental supervision
with safety and rest.)

00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:22.570
(The First Man)

00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:23.970
The police substation just called.

00:28:23.970 --> 00:28:25.380
I flagged him first.

00:28:25.480 --> 00:28:27.240
- What are you talking about?
- Are you going to let go or not?

00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:29.350
- I'm not letting go.
- You've got to be kidding me.

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.380
Who do you take after,
lying so shamelessly like that?

00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:36.350
Ma Seo Rin, don't forget
that you owe everything you have to me.

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:38.090
- It's so cute.
- Is that really for Mom?

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.760
- I think they got switched.
- What's going on here?

00:28:41.890 --> 00:28:45.400
I swear I'll hunt that jerk down
and make him pay.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.970
