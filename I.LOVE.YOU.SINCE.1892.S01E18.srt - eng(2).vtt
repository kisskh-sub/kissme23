WEBVTT

00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:47.950
That's just the first bullet.

00:00:48.016 --> 00:00:50.072
- Leandro!
- So that you can't escape.

00:00:50.452 --> 00:00:51.452
Juanito?

00:00:51.495 --> 00:00:53.205
Leandro, I'm begging you!

00:00:53.592 --> 00:00:55.724
Just this once, please.

00:00:55.749 --> 00:00:57.084
Do you remember?

00:00:57.334 --> 00:00:58.586
When I asked you

00:00:58.611 --> 00:01:01.071
to listen to me explain?

00:01:01.463 --> 00:01:02.464
Did you listen?

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:03.757
You son of a bitch!

00:01:03.924 --> 00:01:06.135
Leandro, no!

00:01:06.609 --> 00:01:08.345
Don't, Leandro!

00:01:09.019 --> 00:01:11.473
Leandro! No...

00:01:11.498 --> 00:01:13.375
You son of a bitch!

00:01:13.706 --> 00:01:14.706
No, don't!

00:01:16.581 --> 00:01:17.581
Juanito!

00:01:23.068 --> 00:01:24.403
I know it hurts a lot.

00:01:27.223 --> 00:01:29.767
And I know it feels like
you don't want to live.

00:01:31.994 --> 00:01:34.163
But I thank the Lord...

00:01:35.581 --> 00:01:37.291
That you're still
here with us.

00:01:43.213 --> 00:01:44.213
This is me.

00:01:44.715 --> 00:01:46.008
Who painted this?

00:01:52.765 --> 00:01:53.765
What I want...

00:01:54.808 --> 00:01:56.143
Is Juanito's life.

00:01:56.168 --> 00:01:58.001
You will regret all of this!

00:02:00.510 --> 00:02:01.510
No!

00:02:03.108 --> 00:02:04.108
Miss?

00:02:04.835 --> 00:02:05.878
Are you alright?

00:02:05.903 --> 00:02:07.408
Did you have a nightmare?

00:02:07.821 --> 00:02:09.365
You must have been
so exhausted

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:10.630
from doing embroidery.

00:02:10.908 --> 00:02:11.908
Me?

00:02:12.368 --> 00:02:13.368
Embroidery?

00:04:24.708 --> 00:04:25.948
I asked you to search for this?

00:04:26.835 --> 00:04:28.629
Yes, Miss.

00:04:28.654 --> 00:04:30.989
I found it by the lake.

00:04:31.392 --> 00:04:33.393
Miss, I must be going now.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:38.275
It must have been Carmelita.

00:04:42.142 --> 00:04:44.394
If Carmelita's presence is here...

00:04:44.978 --> 00:04:47.231
How did she enter my body?

00:04:47.731 --> 00:04:50.381
Is it because Juanito
almost died again?

00:04:50.406 --> 00:04:51.641
And the diary got burned?

00:04:51.968 --> 00:04:53.214
Carmelita?

00:04:53.403 --> 00:04:54.616
Carmelita?

00:04:56.247 --> 00:04:57.269
Carmelita?

00:04:57.294 --> 00:04:58.804
I've been looking for you.

00:04:59.269 --> 00:05:02.605
Father asked you to postpone
visiting Mother's grave.

00:05:08.073 --> 00:05:09.695
When will the rebels make their move?

00:05:11.049 --> 00:05:13.343
I cannot take serving
this family any longer.

00:05:13.549 --> 00:05:16.301
I'm dying to cut Don Alejandro's throat.

00:05:16.593 --> 00:05:17.594
Will you stop it?

00:05:18.335 --> 00:05:19.753
Someone might hear you.

00:05:20.514 --> 00:05:22.224
We can't afford to fail now.

00:05:25.179 --> 00:05:26.179
Emilio.

00:05:26.812 --> 00:05:28.397
I have a favor to ask of you.

00:05:29.565 --> 00:05:31.859
Will you please give
this to Miss Carmelita?

00:05:33.151 --> 00:05:34.651
You still haven't given up on her, Juanito?

00:05:34.829 --> 00:05:36.665
That fake mestiza does
not want you anymore.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:40.676
Her real self is as black
as her father's conscience.

00:05:40.701 --> 00:05:41.785
Calm down, both of you.

00:05:42.494 --> 00:05:43.494
That's enough.

00:05:44.496 --> 00:05:46.957
The servants might wake
up because of your noise.

00:05:47.791 --> 00:05:49.710
I will give this to Miss Carmelita.

00:05:50.794 --> 00:05:52.796
I understand you still have feelings

00:05:52.821 --> 00:05:54.541
for the youngest daughter of Don Alejandro.

00:05:55.132 --> 00:05:56.136
But...

00:05:56.212 --> 00:05:58.798
She has refused to accept
your letters several times.

00:05:59.396 --> 00:06:01.731
And she even threw some of it.

00:06:02.377 --> 00:06:03.870
[murmuring]

00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:12.440
Juanito?

00:06:13.734 --> 00:06:14.734
Carmelita!

00:06:16.403 --> 00:06:17.779
What are you doing here?

00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:19.907
Have you been here a while, Miss?

00:06:22.735 --> 00:06:24.328
What's the problem, Andoy?

00:06:25.454 --> 00:06:26.955
She heard everything, Juanito.

00:06:27.706 --> 00:06:29.082
Carmelita's our ally.

00:06:30.399 --> 00:06:31.399
If that's the case,

00:06:31.958 --> 00:06:34.543
then we'll be holding on to
your fidelity, Miss Carmelita.

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.874
My heart is faithful to Juanito.

00:06:38.305 --> 00:06:41.308
But what if my own mind is my enemy?

00:06:47.476 --> 00:06:49.102
Where am I? Why-

00:06:49.394 --> 00:06:51.313
Why am I dressed differently?

00:06:51.338 --> 00:06:53.914
Miss, would you like to enter?

00:06:55.809 --> 00:06:56.851
Who are you?

00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:58.191
Where is Belinda?

00:06:59.066 --> 00:07:00.192
It is I,

00:07:00.217 --> 00:07:01.217
Angling,

00:07:01.573 --> 00:07:03.379
your new servant.

00:07:03.632 --> 00:07:04.967
Did you forget about it?

00:07:06.453 --> 00:07:07.537
Where is Belinda?

00:07:09.039 --> 00:07:10.039
Miss,

00:07:10.207 --> 00:07:11.583
did you really forget it?

00:07:12.435 --> 00:07:13.994
You were the one who ordered

00:07:14.294 --> 00:07:15.671
to silence Belinda.

00:07:16.349 --> 00:07:17.392
She's gone.

00:07:20.089 --> 00:07:21.966
Wait. What date is it?

00:07:22.344 --> 00:07:24.554
It is the 15th of February, Miss.

00:07:26.369 --> 00:07:29.542
This is the day that
Carmelita controls my body?

00:07:40.655 --> 00:07:41.655
Carmelita,

00:07:42.842 --> 00:07:44.093
have you read

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.631
the letter I gave Natasha?

00:07:48.328 --> 00:07:49.746
I made a promise to you then,

00:07:49.955 --> 00:07:52.541
to never hurt the ones
you love anymore.

00:07:53.166 --> 00:07:54.460
Even Juanito,

00:07:54.836 --> 00:07:56.213
my rival to your love.

00:07:57.443 --> 00:07:58.528
Forget about that.

00:07:59.801 --> 00:08:00.885
What I want

00:08:01.630 --> 00:08:03.965
is for you to kill Juanito
and marry me.

00:08:04.594 --> 00:08:07.556
It would be best if Colonel Santos
would be the one to shoot him.

00:08:08.473 --> 00:08:10.475
So that your name won't be dragged in it.

00:08:15.063 --> 00:08:16.648
Why does it have to be Colonel Santos?

00:08:17.357 --> 00:08:19.401
I relieved him from
service a long time ago.

00:08:20.235 --> 00:08:21.319
And from what I heard,

00:08:21.653 --> 00:08:22.946
he went home to Cavite.

00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:27.200
Call him back and
reinstate Colonel Santos.

00:08:27.784 --> 00:08:29.762
He must be the one to shoot Juanito.

00:08:37.377 --> 00:08:38.670
Miss Carmelita,

00:08:39.171 --> 00:08:40.589
would you mind telling me again?

00:08:41.214 --> 00:08:44.342
Where was it you want me to hide

00:08:44.342 --> 00:08:47.304
that letter you gave me earlier?

00:08:47.971 --> 00:08:48.971
A letter?

00:08:50.479 --> 00:08:51.479
This one.

00:08:55.479 --> 00:08:56.872
Carmelita my love,

00:08:57.048 --> 00:08:59.583
I never want anything
bad to happen to you.

00:08:59.608 --> 00:09:03.469
Which is why I need to warn you
about the planned assault on San Alfonso.

00:09:03.528 --> 00:09:04.528
But...

00:09:05.113 --> 00:09:07.366
I do not know where Juanito is.

00:09:09.826 --> 00:09:11.828
He's at the church of San Alfonso.

00:09:12.662 --> 00:09:14.623
Father Orlando is hiding him.

00:09:16.943 --> 00:09:18.277
He's also hiding

00:09:18.555 --> 00:09:20.212
Angelito Alfonso

00:09:20.405 --> 00:09:22.240
at a Village in the next town.

00:09:22.695 --> 00:09:24.530
The rebel forces of Catapang

00:09:24.686 --> 00:09:27.164
are now in the mountains
of the next town.

00:09:27.969 --> 00:09:32.015
They plan to attack the civil
guards' quarters any day now.

00:09:33.517 --> 00:09:35.268
How did you know all of this?

00:09:38.021 --> 00:09:39.481
Juanito told me everything.

00:09:41.358 --> 00:09:42.776
I thought you love him?

00:09:44.111 --> 00:09:45.111
But now...

00:09:46.196 --> 00:09:47.239
It seems like

00:09:47.906 --> 00:09:49.282
you're betraying him.

00:09:51.993 --> 00:09:53.203
I came back to my senses.

00:09:55.372 --> 00:09:57.541
I shouldn't have loved someone like him.

00:09:59.259 --> 00:10:00.552
I regret

00:10:01.327 --> 00:10:04.205
that I sacrificed myself for him.

00:10:07.884 --> 00:10:10.220
I won't allow my family to get ruined.

00:10:11.988 --> 00:10:16.284
The person who tried to
ruin my family must pay

00:10:16.309 --> 00:10:18.019
for everything he had done.

00:10:30.532 --> 00:10:33.950
Carmelita read this message
and disclosed it all to Leandro.

00:10:35.328 --> 00:10:38.415
I can no longer trust myself anymore.

00:10:39.249 --> 00:10:42.793
I need to prevent the information
which Juanito is providing from spreading.

00:10:42.919 --> 00:10:45.786
For every truth that finds its way to me...

00:10:45.922 --> 00:10:47.934
they become more at risk.

00:10:48.091 --> 00:10:50.427
I was planning to do this a long time ago.

00:10:51.303 --> 00:10:52.303
But...

00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:54.973
my nerves always gets to me.

00:10:57.348 --> 00:10:58.974
But I believe...

00:11:00.645 --> 00:11:01.938
That everything

00:11:02.856 --> 00:11:04.232
deserves a second chance.

00:11:07.319 --> 00:11:09.029
So, with this chance...

00:11:11.573 --> 00:11:13.909
I'd like to ask you something.

00:11:14.451 --> 00:11:17.120
I should've asked a long time ago
if only you came to the pier.

00:11:24.085 --> 00:11:26.254
Will you spend the
rest of your life with me?

00:11:36.139 --> 00:11:37.139
I.

00:11:37.849 --> 00:11:38.849
Love.

00:11:39.476 --> 00:11:40.476
You.

00:11:42.844 --> 00:11:44.387
I love you too, Juanito.

00:12:09.214 --> 00:12:10.214
This is for you.

00:12:12.425 --> 00:12:14.094
When will I see you again?

00:12:18.512 --> 00:12:19.513
In ten days.

00:12:20.892 --> 00:12:22.828
It's hard slipping away from Father.

00:12:25.105 --> 00:12:26.105
Ten days?

00:12:26.692 --> 00:12:27.776
I will be waiting.

00:12:45.542 --> 00:12:47.335
Let them face me!

00:12:48.308 --> 00:12:49.308
Sir!

00:12:49.523 --> 00:12:50.730
Quickly!

00:12:51.106 --> 00:12:53.066
Father is questioning them

00:12:53.091 --> 00:12:55.927
about the rebels in line with Ka Tapang.

00:12:57.762 --> 00:12:59.968
Most of them has an
cross mark on their backs.

00:12:59.993 --> 00:13:01.933
I want to know who are
the traitors among you!

00:13:03.534 --> 00:13:04.618
How did you know?

00:13:06.563 --> 00:13:07.563
Know what?

00:13:13.278 --> 00:13:14.863
Take off their clothes!

00:13:15.655 --> 00:13:17.782
Strip! Take it off!

00:13:22.342 --> 00:13:23.527
Father! Father,

00:13:23.663 --> 00:13:26.497
maybe it's better to
stop this for awhile.

00:13:27.292 --> 00:13:28.852
What the hell are you doing?

00:13:30.003 --> 00:13:31.004
Alejandro!

00:13:32.493 --> 00:13:35.586
- Father!
- Father! Father!

00:14:17.901 --> 00:14:19.402
So, you're awake.

00:14:19.427 --> 00:14:20.804
Would you like to have breakfast?

00:14:20.829 --> 00:14:24.283
There's still some cow's milk
and bread downstairs.

00:14:25.266 --> 00:14:26.518
What date is it today?

00:14:27.102 --> 00:14:29.354
It's the 24th of February, dear.

00:14:31.523 --> 00:14:32.899
Kill Juanito.

00:14:34.317 --> 00:14:35.317
I am here.

00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:36.610
I am here.

00:14:37.153 --> 00:14:39.280
Kill him at the end of
the month of February.

00:14:43.976 --> 00:14:45.519
What about our agreement?

00:14:46.871 --> 00:14:48.623
Please forget about it now.

00:14:49.624 --> 00:14:51.960
But all the gold I gave you is still yours.

00:14:53.002 --> 00:14:56.089
I will also speak to Leandro
and ask him not to fire you.

00:14:58.007 --> 00:14:59.592
Just make sure that whatever happens...

00:15:00.718 --> 00:15:02.429
You won't hurt Juanito.

00:15:04.431 --> 00:15:06.516
Even if the order comes
from me, don't do it.

00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:13.230
General.

00:15:14.149 --> 00:15:15.483
I will take my leave now.

00:15:36.546 --> 00:15:37.546
Leandro...

00:15:38.923 --> 00:15:41.384
You don't have to give me flowers.

00:15:46.806 --> 00:15:48.224
Gratitude and...

00:15:50.935 --> 00:15:53.354
Letting go are what

00:15:53.730 --> 00:15:55.398
these flowers stand for.

00:16:00.403 --> 00:16:03.281
Gratitude and... Letting go?

00:16:07.035 --> 00:16:09.662
Every time I see roses...

00:16:11.289 --> 00:16:12.957
It always reminds me of you.

00:16:16.419 --> 00:16:18.630
You are the rose of my life, Carmelita.

00:16:23.092 --> 00:16:24.469
And just as the saying goes...

00:16:26.012 --> 00:16:27.597
When you can let go of

00:16:28.389 --> 00:16:30.642
the thing most important to you...

00:16:32.185 --> 00:16:33.812
Then you will be able to...

00:16:35.063 --> 00:16:37.732
Start the new chapter of your life.

00:16:41.236 --> 00:16:43.029
A new chapter of your life?

00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:47.116
Do you mean

00:16:48.493 --> 00:16:50.286
you're taking back...

00:16:51.955 --> 00:16:53.206
our arrangement?

00:16:57.502 --> 00:16:58.545
I have accepted it.

00:16:59.003 --> 00:17:01.548
And I'm happy for you and Juanito.

00:17:03.216 --> 00:17:04.759
I know that he's

00:17:05.051 --> 00:17:06.051
the one you love.

00:17:08.012 --> 00:17:10.014
When I saw this necklace...

00:17:12.892 --> 00:17:14.894
I already knew he gave it to you.

00:17:20.024 --> 00:17:22.026
But don't worry, Carmelita.

00:17:22.695 --> 00:17:23.819
I know

00:17:24.279 --> 00:17:25.989
it won't be easy for me...

00:17:28.741 --> 00:17:31.035
To forget the love I have for you.

00:17:33.732 --> 00:17:35.316
But I believe...

00:17:37.272 --> 00:17:38.691
That the time will come...

00:17:41.671 --> 00:17:43.423
That I will learn how to forget you.

00:17:47.927 --> 00:17:49.053
Only our

00:17:49.078 --> 00:17:50.747
friendship and

00:17:51.681 --> 00:17:53.891
good memories...

00:17:55.101 --> 00:17:57.186
Will remain in our hearts.

00:18:03.735 --> 00:18:04.777
Thank you.

00:18:09.741 --> 00:18:10.741
Thank you.

00:18:13.286 --> 00:18:15.747
For all the times you made my heart happy.

00:18:23.671 --> 00:18:24.797
Thank you.

00:18:27.717 --> 00:18:28.843
For every smile,

00:18:29.719 --> 00:18:31.054
and every lesson

00:18:31.079 --> 00:18:32.580
you've ever taught me.

00:18:35.016 --> 00:18:36.725
I will carry all of that,

00:18:37.935 --> 00:18:39.854
not as wounds...

00:18:41.022 --> 00:18:43.358
But as a reminder

00:18:44.776 --> 00:18:47.111
that I was loved by someone like you.

00:19:05.463 --> 00:19:08.174
Thank you very much
for everything, Leandro.

00:19:10.201 --> 00:19:11.594
Because of you...

00:19:13.638 --> 00:19:14.889
I learned that.

00:19:16.265 --> 00:19:17.892
Love can be...

00:19:19.089 --> 00:19:20.716
an inspiration.

00:19:21.604 --> 00:19:23.690
To reach for your dreams.

00:19:25.817 --> 00:19:26.984
Thank you.

00:19:35.493 --> 00:19:38.151
I have a strong feeling
your baby is a girl.

00:19:39.206 --> 00:19:41.041
My only wish is

00:19:41.413 --> 00:19:42.981
for you to name her

00:19:43.376 --> 00:19:44.376
Carmen.

00:19:45.185 --> 00:19:46.187
And

00:19:46.212 --> 00:19:48.840
if she has a daughter,
I want her to be named...

00:19:50.925 --> 00:19:51.925
Carmina.

00:19:52.652 --> 00:19:54.696
And if Carmina gives
birth to a daughter too,

00:19:54.721 --> 00:19:56.222
I want her to be named Carmenia.

00:19:56.993 --> 00:20:00.313
It seems like you have
planned my whole lineage.

00:20:00.622 --> 00:20:03.917
Why don't you use those names
for your children with Juanito?

00:20:04.731 --> 00:20:06.315
That's impossible to happen.

00:20:11.863 --> 00:20:13.823
Why are you giving this to me?

00:20:15.283 --> 00:20:17.243
I want you to give that to...

00:20:18.911 --> 00:20:20.079
Carmenia's daughter.

00:20:20.913 --> 00:20:23.374
The fourth generation from you.

00:20:24.375 --> 00:20:25.460
That's for her.

00:20:30.089 --> 00:20:31.174
Of course.

00:20:36.262 --> 00:20:37.263
Carmelita?

00:20:37.930 --> 00:20:38.931
Carmelita?

00:20:57.849 --> 00:21:01.561
This is all your fault!

00:21:03.505 --> 00:21:04.693
Kill me...

00:21:05.171 --> 00:21:07.590
or I'll kill you!

00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.670
Wait! Don't go near me!

00:21:09.695 --> 00:21:12.114
You ruined my life!

00:21:12.381 --> 00:21:14.717
Kill me now!

00:21:36.572 --> 00:21:38.074
Happy birthday!

00:21:38.866 --> 00:21:39.866
Carmela.

00:22:20.119 --> 00:22:22.605
Even if I've returned back,

00:22:23.114 --> 00:22:24.714
I still can't accept

00:22:25.469 --> 00:22:27.437
leaving Juanito all alone.

00:22:36.328 --> 00:22:37.454
OMG, Carms!

00:22:37.942 --> 00:22:39.193
Carmela!

00:22:39.218 --> 00:22:40.469
What are you doing there?

00:22:40.469 --> 00:22:41.804
Come on, stand. Stand up.

00:22:41.804 --> 00:22:43.806
Do you really not want to graduate?

00:22:44.181 --> 00:22:45.433
Stand up.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:47.368
Carmela, what happened?

00:22:47.393 --> 00:22:48.853
Why are you crying?

00:22:49.228 --> 00:22:50.354
Are you okay?

00:22:51.856 --> 00:22:55.138
- Carmela! Carmela!
- Carmela! Carmela!

00:22:57.987 --> 00:22:59.864
- Dad, I'm sorry.
- Don't cry.

00:23:00.156 --> 00:23:01.156
Don't cry.

00:23:02.366 --> 00:23:03.366
I love you, Dad.

00:23:03.826 --> 00:23:04.826
I love you.

00:23:05.578 --> 00:23:06.829
I love you too, dear.

00:23:07.955 --> 00:23:08.955
Stop crying.

00:23:09.290 --> 00:23:11.083
Hey. Wipe those tears.

00:23:12.126 --> 00:23:13.628
You know, the doctor said

00:23:14.337 --> 00:23:16.881
it might have been over-fatigue.

00:23:17.423 --> 00:23:18.799
That's why you fainted.

00:23:20.801 --> 00:23:21.801
Maybe...

00:23:22.803 --> 00:23:26.182
That incident the other
day took a toll on you.

00:23:26.724 --> 00:23:28.559
It was just last week
when that happened?

00:23:29.535 --> 00:23:30.578
So it means...

00:23:30.603 --> 00:23:33.367
It is still February 29, 2025 today?

00:23:33.706 --> 00:23:36.625
This was the day when
Mother Olivia pushed me.

00:23:36.692 --> 00:23:38.184
On the Arc of the Centuries?

00:23:45.974 --> 00:23:48.977
So the time in our present days stopped.

00:23:49.038 --> 00:23:51.269
When I was in the past.

00:24:01.137 --> 00:24:04.766
Intramuros was known
as the walled-city of Manila

00:24:04.846 --> 00:24:07.486
- during the Spanish era in 16th century.
- Carmela, we're up next.

00:24:07.865 --> 00:24:10.701
The name Intramuros is a Latin verb

00:24:10.726 --> 00:24:12.937
which means "within the walls."

00:24:13.204 --> 00:24:16.040
Meaning, it is within
the walled enclosure

00:24:16.065 --> 00:24:18.234
of cities and fortresses.

00:24:18.609 --> 00:24:20.403
As it describes structures

00:24:20.403 --> 00:24:22.154
as thick, high walls,

00:24:22.179 --> 00:24:23.806
and are surrounded by moats.

00:24:24.365 --> 00:24:27.493
There you have it.
The history of the walled city of Manila.

00:24:36.752 --> 00:24:37.878
Good afternoon!

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:41.065
Our topic is the Philippine
list of well-known families

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:42.767
during the 19th century.

00:24:43.150 --> 00:24:46.445
Well, the principalaria or
the noble class was the ruling

00:24:46.470 --> 00:24:48.472
and usually educated upper class

00:24:48.497 --> 00:24:50.544
in the towns of the Spanish Philippines.

00:24:50.808 --> 00:24:54.770
The members of this class
enjoy these exclusive privileges.

00:24:55.037 --> 00:24:56.205
Like voting,

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:58.399
be elected for the public office,

00:24:58.424 --> 00:25:02.178
and of course, being addressed
by the titles of Don or Doña.

00:25:02.403 --> 00:25:03.654
Examples are...

00:25:03.654 --> 00:25:05.072
the Alfonso Family.

00:25:06.657 --> 00:25:07.867
The Alfonso Family

00:25:07.892 --> 00:25:10.980
has led San Alfonso for a long time.

00:25:11.503 --> 00:25:14.469
Don Mariano Alfonso was
the last leader of the town.

00:25:15.374 --> 00:25:19.370
He was removed from power
after being accused of treason.

00:25:20.087 --> 00:25:21.422
The Montecarlos Family

00:25:21.447 --> 00:25:24.692
was considered as the
richest family in San Alfonso.

00:25:25.029 --> 00:25:30.707
They were known for their large businesses
in Coconuts, Abaca and other products.

00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:35.144
This businesses contributed
greatly in the Philippine trade.

00:25:35.811 --> 00:25:38.814
The Flores family was
led by Vicente Flores.

00:25:39.565 --> 00:25:42.568
He was the last Gobernadorcilio
before the uprising.

00:25:42.593 --> 00:25:44.753
And the end of the Spanish regime.

00:25:51.535 --> 00:25:55.498
Those were just names in the
history of San Alfonso before.

00:25:56.332 --> 00:25:57.333
Now,

00:25:57.358 --> 00:25:59.902
they are all big part of my life.

00:26:01.962 --> 00:26:03.547
Yes, that will be all.

00:26:03.547 --> 00:26:04.840
Thank you, guys, for listening.

00:26:14.308 --> 00:26:16.977
Miss Isabella, what did you learn?

00:26:30.741 --> 00:26:32.952
You might not believe me, sir, but...

00:26:34.245 --> 00:26:35.788
I learned a lot.

00:26:36.789 --> 00:26:39.125
I will admit I'm not interested in history.

00:26:41.919 --> 00:26:45.798
But it's not too late to give
history some importance.

00:26:47.049 --> 00:26:48.676
Because if not for the past,

00:26:49.635 --> 00:26:51.011
there wouldn't be a present.

00:26:53.389 --> 00:26:56.183
We're actually lucky
we didn't have to live

00:26:56.183 --> 00:26:57.476
during the colonial period.

00:26:58.227 --> 00:27:04.417
When human rights were not equal.

00:27:05.359 --> 00:27:07.153
Living in the own motherland, but...

00:27:08.350 --> 00:27:10.102
Slaves to colonizers.

00:27:10.865 --> 00:27:12.491
You're always careful

00:27:12.516 --> 00:27:14.894
not to taint your name or else,

00:27:15.286 --> 00:27:16.912
you'll be sentenced to death.

00:27:18.389 --> 00:27:21.851
Young ladies are
expected to act decent

00:27:21.876 --> 00:27:23.335
with traditional Filipina values.

00:27:24.879 --> 00:27:26.505
You can't befriend people

00:27:26.530 --> 00:27:28.908
that didn't come from the
same social status as you.

00:27:29.550 --> 00:27:34.013
Parents arrange their
children's marriage all the time.

00:27:36.182 --> 00:27:38.058
But I think,

00:27:39.943 --> 00:27:42.529
things that you must work
hard for have more value.

00:27:43.439 --> 00:27:46.025
Because if you worked hard for something,

00:27:46.650 --> 00:27:48.277
you will also treasure it.

00:27:49.195 --> 00:27:51.864
Just like writing a letter...

00:27:53.699 --> 00:27:56.827
Cooking using charcoal and clay pots...

00:27:58.621 --> 00:28:00.331
Using old-school lamps...

00:28:02.708 --> 00:28:04.293
And so many other things.

00:28:32.863 --> 00:28:36.741
- Happy birthday, Carmela!
- Happy birthday!

00:28:39.912 --> 00:28:40.996
I missed you all!

00:28:41.513 --> 00:28:43.927
I thought I wasn't able to see guys again.

00:28:44.208 --> 00:28:46.377
Even though we argue a lot.

00:28:46.402 --> 00:28:47.403
That's fine.

00:28:47.561 --> 00:28:48.896
As long as we're together.

00:28:48.921 --> 00:28:50.047
Okay, that's enough.

00:28:50.047 --> 00:28:51.632
Let's go blow the candle.

00:28:51.657 --> 00:28:53.705
Let's go! Cake time!

00:28:53.801 --> 00:28:55.412
Don't forget to make a wish.

00:28:56.470 --> 00:28:57.263
Alright!

00:28:57.288 --> 00:28:58.722
- There it is...
- Let's go!

00:28:58.722 --> 00:28:59.722
Wish.

00:29:02.685 --> 00:29:05.609
Happy birthday, Carmela! Happy birthday!

00:29:05.634 --> 00:29:08.162
- We love you!
- Thank you!

00:29:20.577 --> 00:29:21.577
Dad?

00:29:23.539 --> 00:29:25.332
There's just something
I'd like to give you.

00:29:30.004 --> 00:29:32.180
I found that in my office earlier today.

00:29:32.506 --> 00:29:34.591
From your Lola Carmina.

00:29:35.342 --> 00:29:38.470
She got it from an old
dresser in her house.

00:29:42.099 --> 00:29:43.935
Oh my God!

00:29:44.038 --> 00:29:48.132
This was the letter that I wrote
when I drowned myself in the lake of tears.

00:29:52.151 --> 00:29:53.319
I must admit.

00:29:53.986 --> 00:29:55.696
I was surprised with what you did.

00:29:56.755 --> 00:30:00.175
I never thought you'll find
a unique way to apologize

00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:02.286
to me and your sisters

00:30:02.311 --> 00:30:05.981
because you sneaked out
of your Lola Carmina's house.

00:30:06.874 --> 00:30:07.916
You read it?

00:30:09.631 --> 00:30:11.003
I was curious.

00:30:11.670 --> 00:30:15.466
It's a century old letter
addressed to my name.

00:30:16.216 --> 00:30:17.216
You know,

00:30:17.634 --> 00:30:20.429
Jenny and Emily should
read that letter of yours.

00:30:22.097 --> 00:30:23.097
Dad, no.

00:30:23.143 --> 00:30:24.199
No.

00:30:24.224 --> 00:30:25.768
Okay. Fine.

00:30:26.352 --> 00:30:27.936
I will just tell them

00:30:28.145 --> 00:30:29.145
that according to you,

00:30:29.855 --> 00:30:33.067
they must study
Philippine history that you...

00:30:34.109 --> 00:30:35.486
Took for granted before.

00:30:39.448 --> 00:30:40.448
Okay.

00:30:41.033 --> 00:30:42.242
Okay. Fine, fine.

00:30:43.702 --> 00:30:44.787
Happy birthday, dear.

00:30:45.672 --> 00:30:46.705
Thanks, Dad.

00:30:46.705 --> 00:30:47.705
Thank you.

00:30:57.049 --> 00:30:58.437
Happy birthday,

00:30:59.426 --> 00:31:00.511
Carmela.

00:31:04.014 --> 00:31:05.302
It means...

00:31:05.516 --> 00:31:07.615
He knows that I'm not Carmelita.

00:31:08.185 --> 00:31:09.937
But how did that happened?

00:31:10.270 --> 00:31:11.270
Dad?

00:31:11.772 --> 00:31:13.315
Can I ask for a favor?

00:31:14.733 --> 00:31:15.733
What is it?

00:31:16.335 --> 00:31:18.879
Can I go to San Alfonso?

00:31:18.904 --> 00:31:20.531
To Lola Carmina.

00:31:23.534 --> 00:31:24.534
Alright.

00:31:27.371 --> 00:31:28.371
Thank you.

00:31:30.374 --> 00:31:31.375
Oh, Lorenzo.

00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.527
Take their things upstairs.

00:31:33.752 --> 00:31:35.796
Put them at the room
where we usually sleep in.

00:31:35.821 --> 00:31:37.656
He's Lucia's grandson.

00:31:38.173 --> 00:31:39.173
Cute!

00:31:39.198 --> 00:31:40.365
Is he your crush?

00:31:41.176 --> 00:31:42.970
Hey. You're too young.

00:31:43.178 --> 00:31:45.597
Carmela, are you living in Spanish times?

00:31:45.622 --> 00:31:46.665
You're so conservative.

00:31:47.141 --> 00:31:48.261
Let's go to the dining room.

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:53.313
I made you kaldereta ala Montecarlos.

00:32:22.342 --> 00:32:23.844
Be mindful of the things.

00:32:25.095 --> 00:32:27.973
My grandmother was strict

00:32:28.557 --> 00:32:30.976
when she ordered not to
change anything in this room.

00:32:32.144 --> 00:32:35.606
Because her youngest sister died in here.

00:32:36.773 --> 00:32:38.525
Carmelita died in here?

00:32:39.359 --> 00:32:42.488
How did you know that
Carmelita was the name

00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.532
of my grandmother's sister?

00:32:55.417 --> 00:32:57.169
You told me her name, grandma.

00:32:57.753 --> 00:32:59.588
Didn't you show me

00:33:00.001 --> 00:33:03.254
her painting at the secret
room inside the library?

00:33:05.093 --> 00:33:07.554
I showed you the secret room?

00:33:09.348 --> 00:33:10.553
Oh my God!

00:33:10.735 --> 00:33:12.855
Looks like Grandmother Carmina
wasn't fooling around.

00:33:13.143 --> 00:33:15.354
She has no idea what happened to me.

00:33:18.106 --> 00:33:20.192
My mom told me about it before.

00:33:20.692 --> 00:33:21.693
Maybe.

00:33:22.152 --> 00:33:26.156
Maybe I told your
mother about those things.

00:33:27.366 --> 00:33:28.367
Then,

00:33:29.451 --> 00:33:31.078
you're interested

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.498
in the family of our ancestors.

00:33:38.794 --> 00:33:42.673
The Montecarlos family
suffered an unfortunate fate.

00:33:43.757 --> 00:33:44.967
Thank you, my friend.

00:33:47.344 --> 00:33:50.055
How did the inspector
find out about this?

00:33:51.622 --> 00:33:56.085
The Alfonso family
already have this document.

00:33:57.020 --> 00:34:02.442
And only Juanito could
pull off something like this.

00:34:04.611 --> 00:34:09.950
That letter contains all the grievances...

00:34:09.950 --> 00:34:13.161
All the hardships Filipino suffered

00:34:13.161 --> 00:34:18.108
in the hands of the Spanish
here in the Philippines.

00:34:20.335 --> 00:34:23.088
My name could be mentioned in this letter.

00:34:23.922 --> 00:34:24.922
It's possible.

00:34:25.632 --> 00:34:26.632
But,

00:34:26.717 --> 00:34:29.845
if I'm right that Juanito
sent that letter...

00:34:30.345 --> 00:34:33.557
Maybe he didn't include your name.

00:34:34.349 --> 00:34:35.767
Because the moment

00:34:36.518 --> 00:34:37.728
he does that...

00:34:38.103 --> 00:34:41.148
Your youngest daughter
will get involved.

00:34:43.609 --> 00:34:46.904
Juanito desires Carmelita, doesn't he?

00:34:49.197 --> 00:34:50.197
Yes.

00:34:51.825 --> 00:34:54.036
They were in a relationship
for quite some time.

00:34:57.241 --> 00:35:01.996
I didn't expect that their love
I have been so opposed to...

00:35:03.462 --> 00:35:05.130
Would be the thing that saves me.

00:35:05.922 --> 00:35:08.200
But, we are not sure.

00:35:09.594 --> 00:35:13.347
Governor Flores might
implicate your name too.

00:35:13.805 --> 00:35:17.934
Don Alejandro tried
to escape to Spain.

00:35:19.103 --> 00:35:21.772
But they were caught in the crossfire.

00:35:22.230 --> 00:35:23.440
Escape.

00:35:23.732 --> 00:35:24.941
Go

00:35:25.609 --> 00:35:27.736
and stay at different countries.

00:35:27.986 --> 00:35:29.446
Change your name.

00:35:29.471 --> 00:35:31.014
Change your surname.

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:36.018
So that the fiscal tasked
to investigate this case

00:35:36.078 --> 00:35:39.206
will find it difficult to locate you.

00:35:41.890 --> 00:35:43.350
I need your gun.

00:35:56.473 --> 00:35:57.473
Here!

00:35:57.933 --> 00:35:59.142
You can have it.

00:36:18.662 --> 00:36:19.996
Carmelita! Maria!

00:36:19.996 --> 00:36:21.081
Let's get out of here!

00:36:22.999 --> 00:36:24.084
Let's go to the other side!

00:36:26.031 --> 00:36:27.031
Eduardo!

00:36:27.129 --> 00:36:28.964
I know a safe way out of here.

00:36:30.048 --> 00:36:31.216
Just trust me.

00:36:31.241 --> 00:36:32.743
And why would we trust you?

00:36:33.964 --> 00:36:35.665
Because I won't let no harm
come to your daughter!

00:36:40.045 --> 00:36:41.045
Let's go!

00:36:44.053 --> 00:36:46.639
Didn't you mention earlier, Grandma...

00:36:47.093 --> 00:36:50.946
That the Montecarlos family were caught

00:36:51.115 --> 00:36:53.134
in the crossfire of the
rebels and the army?

00:36:54.235 --> 00:36:55.653
What happened to them?

00:36:56.742 --> 00:36:57.960
They said

00:36:58.368 --> 00:37:01.788
the rebel leader was killed.

00:37:25.269 --> 00:37:26.269
But...

00:37:26.547 --> 00:37:29.532
Leandro Flores was also killed.

00:37:29.766 --> 00:37:34.900
The son of Gobernadorcillo Flores
of San Alfonso.

00:38:00.052 --> 00:38:03.931
Send my gratitude to
your father for this oil.

00:38:04.142 --> 00:38:06.770
This will greatly help
with my aching joints.

00:38:07.771 --> 00:38:09.480
Oh, Carmela, dear.

00:38:10.152 --> 00:38:11.191
Carmela,

00:38:11.216 --> 00:38:12.592
good thing you're awake.

00:38:13.151 --> 00:38:14.528
Let's eat some breakfast.

00:38:18.715 --> 00:38:20.300
His name is John.

00:38:20.325 --> 00:38:22.410
The son of my neighbor.

00:38:24.830 --> 00:38:26.414
Hi. Good morning.

00:38:28.294 --> 00:38:29.820
He is not Juanito.

00:38:30.032 --> 00:38:31.617
But he looks like him a lot.

00:38:32.212 --> 00:38:33.428
Even his smile.

00:38:34.172 --> 00:38:35.172
I remember you!

00:38:36.078 --> 00:38:39.332
You were the one who
had an incident at the bar?

00:38:50.856 --> 00:38:52.274
You were the one who saved me?

00:38:54.709 --> 00:38:57.170
You're such a good kid.

00:38:57.195 --> 00:38:59.725
Thank you for saving my granddaughter.

00:38:59.808 --> 00:39:01.101
You're welcome, Grandma.

00:39:02.025 --> 00:39:04.719
You two eat together.

00:39:04.744 --> 00:39:07.188
I'll just get some desserts.

00:39:07.213 --> 00:39:09.165
Go, sit down. Eat.

00:39:09.165 --> 00:39:10.165
Eat up.

00:39:18.106 --> 00:39:19.106
Um...

00:39:20.635 --> 00:39:22.053
I want to apologize for last time.

00:39:22.568 --> 00:39:24.152
I left you at the precinct.

00:39:25.324 --> 00:39:27.500
There was an emergency at home.

00:39:29.394 --> 00:39:30.979
And if you don't mind...

00:39:33.906 --> 00:39:37.451
Is it okay if I invite you
for coffee next week?

00:39:37.736 --> 00:39:39.029
It's my treat.

00:39:41.489 --> 00:39:43.044
Is he asking me out?

00:39:45.535 --> 00:39:46.535
Sure.

00:39:48.538 --> 00:39:50.248
Do you really like what you do?

00:39:51.249 --> 00:39:52.667
You don't want to be a doctor,

00:39:52.692 --> 00:39:54.110
or do painting?

00:39:55.391 --> 00:39:57.303
I'm not passionate about medicine.

00:39:58.271 --> 00:40:00.857
And I also don't have
the talent for painting.

00:40:03.347 --> 00:40:04.347
To be honest...

00:40:05.513 --> 00:40:06.890
I want to go into IT.

00:40:07.584 --> 00:40:08.613
But of course,

00:40:08.638 --> 00:40:10.626
my Dad's gonna pay for my tuition.

00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:12.243
He's taking care of my education.

00:40:12.562 --> 00:40:14.522
So I don't have a choice
but take accounting.

00:40:15.482 --> 00:40:16.566
We're in the same boat.

00:40:17.108 --> 00:40:19.444
After I graduate, I want to study history.

00:40:19.611 --> 00:40:20.612
I wanna be a

00:40:21.112 --> 00:40:22.364
history professor.

00:40:24.366 --> 00:40:25.366
Really?

00:40:27.661 --> 00:40:29.579
Why do you want to study

00:40:30.013 --> 00:40:31.598
the past when it's been long over?

00:40:31.623 --> 00:40:33.375
That's why past is past, right?

00:40:35.669 --> 00:40:37.549
Juanito and John really
are different from each other.

00:40:37.949 --> 00:40:39.869
- Because he will not say those things.
- Bill out!

00:40:42.342 --> 00:40:44.495
Why am I comparing him to Juanito?

00:40:46.779 --> 00:40:47.779
Thank you.

00:41:02.529 --> 00:41:04.197
Your name is Juanito Alfonso?

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:10.333
We've all been named Juanito

00:41:11.830 --> 00:41:14.083
starting from my great-great grandfather.

00:41:14.346 --> 00:41:16.333
That's why I just use John.

00:41:16.810 --> 00:41:18.853
I'm getting sick of the name Juanito.

00:41:18.878 --> 00:41:21.673
Wait, are you a native of San Alfonso?

00:41:24.342 --> 00:41:25.342
Yes.

00:41:27.095 --> 00:41:29.014
Can you introduce me to your family?

00:41:31.504 --> 00:41:33.214
Really? You want to
level up that quickly?

00:41:33.768 --> 00:41:35.734
No... No, it's just--

00:41:36.734 --> 00:41:38.235
I just want to know your...

00:41:38.398 --> 00:41:39.941
Your family history.

00:41:40.457 --> 00:41:42.334
You know I'm interested in history, right?

00:41:44.070 --> 00:41:45.070
Okay...

00:41:45.196 --> 00:41:47.032
But on one condition.

00:41:48.742 --> 00:41:50.118
Never call me Juanito, okay?

00:41:50.952 --> 00:41:52.495
It's so old-fashioned.

00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:53.605
It sounds so poor.

00:41:54.664 --> 00:41:55.749
It doesn't suit me.

00:42:02.297 --> 00:42:03.297
Carmela, wait!

00:42:05.717 --> 00:42:07.802
What's the problem?
Did I say something wrong?

00:42:08.595 --> 00:42:09.637
Is it the name?

00:42:10.805 --> 00:42:12.015
If you think about it,
it's just a name.

00:42:12.040 --> 00:42:13.208
I could easily replace it.

00:42:14.601 --> 00:42:15.727
You know what, you're right.

00:42:16.436 --> 00:42:17.436
It's just a name.

00:42:18.688 --> 00:42:19.814
But for me...

00:42:20.899 --> 00:42:22.567
It can never be replaced.

00:42:25.420 --> 00:42:27.389
John and Juanito really do look like a lot.

00:42:27.906 --> 00:42:29.574
But he is not Juanito.

00:42:30.116 --> 00:42:32.528
It's not a good idea
for someone broken hearted

00:42:32.577 --> 00:42:35.428
To find another person
to heal my broken heart.

00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:03.983
Good morning, Dr. Alfonso.

00:43:04.008 --> 00:43:05.927
Good morning, mister.

00:43:10.901 --> 00:43:12.819
He really became a Doctor.

00:43:24.420 --> 00:43:25.421
Carmela!

00:43:32.689 --> 00:43:34.114
I just want to apologize

00:43:34.139 --> 00:43:36.620
for all the wrong things
I've done to you.

00:43:37.897 --> 00:43:40.107
I also want to apologize
for being so shallow.

00:43:42.667 --> 00:43:44.293
It's not too late for us, right?

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.440
Beshie?

00:43:45.733 --> 00:43:46.733
Of course.

00:43:47.402 --> 00:43:48.402
Beshie.

00:44:00.832 --> 00:44:01.832
Hello?

00:44:03.501 --> 00:44:04.544
Good day to you.

00:44:04.569 --> 00:44:05.755
Please come in.

00:44:06.434 --> 00:44:07.434
What can I help you with?

00:45:08.149 --> 00:45:09.275
I'll go ahead.

00:45:10.526 --> 00:45:11.526
Wait...

00:45:13.529 --> 00:45:14.529
I think...

00:45:14.948 --> 00:45:15.949
I already saw you.

00:45:17.450 --> 00:45:18.450
What?

00:45:20.161 --> 00:45:21.161
That's right.

00:45:22.747 --> 00:45:23.747
It's you.

00:45:25.375 --> 00:45:27.085
You're the one in the painting.

00:45:29.379 --> 00:45:30.379
Painting?

00:45:58.491 --> 00:45:59.826
He finished it.

00:46:00.488 --> 00:46:01.488
They said,

00:46:01.869 --> 00:46:04.272
Don Juanito didn't get
the chance to get married.

00:46:04.414 --> 00:46:07.598
Because he was devastated
waiting for a girl she truly loves.

00:46:08.617 --> 00:46:10.369
He loved that woman very much.

00:46:13.826 --> 00:46:15.661
Every day, before twilight,

00:46:16.538 --> 00:46:19.541
he will always be at the
mango tree outside the hacienda.

00:46:20.004 --> 00:46:21.964
To wait for the woman's return.

00:46:25.643 --> 00:46:27.528
But the days passed...

00:46:27.553 --> 00:46:28.638
The months...

00:46:28.817 --> 00:46:31.923
The years... And even
after decades until his death.

00:46:32.259 --> 00:46:33.787
The woman never returned.

00:46:36.328 --> 00:46:38.203
This woman, they called her...

00:46:39.014 --> 00:46:40.974
Carmelita Montecarlos.

00:46:41.821 --> 00:46:43.235
But this woman in the portrait was named..

00:46:43.330 --> 00:46:44.665
Carmela Isabella.

00:46:44.690 --> 00:46:45.850
By great-grandfather Juanito.

00:47:10.254 --> 00:47:11.272
Aside from that,

00:47:11.272 --> 00:47:13.192
my great-grandfather
Juanito left another thing.

00:47:15.610 --> 00:47:17.070
These are the diaries.

00:47:49.394 --> 00:47:50.394
Child,

00:47:51.187 --> 00:47:52.563
are you alright?

00:47:55.441 --> 00:47:58.694
Why do you seem so lost
in thought sometimes?

00:47:59.529 --> 00:48:01.906
Your father is getting worried.

00:48:04.117 --> 00:48:07.078
You've been here in
San Alfonso for three weeks.

00:48:08.704 --> 00:48:10.123
Is there a problem?

00:48:11.374 --> 00:48:13.876
On your birthday,

00:48:15.169 --> 00:48:17.422
I should've given this to you.

00:48:18.548 --> 00:48:20.758
But you went home immediately.

00:48:22.366 --> 00:48:26.620
Good thing I found it
while cleaning the room.

00:48:37.608 --> 00:48:39.360
And that letter

00:48:41.487 --> 00:48:42.864
was from...

00:48:44.198 --> 00:48:46.909
Mr. Juanito.

00:48:57.628 --> 00:49:00.047
I have only seen it once.

00:49:18.483 --> 00:49:20.026
Please put it inside the library.

00:49:20.051 --> 00:49:21.051
Thank you!

00:49:22.408 --> 00:49:23.408
Um...

00:49:23.633 --> 00:49:26.093
Sir, when will the paints arrive?

00:49:26.132 --> 00:49:27.381
It's on its way, ma'am.

00:49:27.406 --> 00:49:28.406
Oh, alright then.

00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:34.081
Hello, Emily?

00:49:34.624 --> 00:49:36.744
Carmela, Dad and I we're on our way.

00:49:36.918 --> 00:49:41.022
We just need the papers so you
can open your new museum next month.

00:49:41.099 --> 00:49:42.475
- Really?
- Yeah.

00:49:42.590 --> 00:49:45.234
Dad's really on full support
even though you shifted course.

00:49:45.551 --> 00:49:46.860
Even Grandmother Carmina.

00:49:47.195 --> 00:49:49.363
I think they are happy that
you already found your passion.

00:49:49.388 --> 00:49:50.389
Which is history.

00:49:52.475 --> 00:49:54.060
This isn't just for me.

00:49:54.473 --> 00:49:56.684
This museum will also be a great help

00:49:56.871 --> 00:49:59.415
to preserve the history of San Alfonso.

00:50:00.066 --> 00:50:01.609
Emily, I'll go ahead, okay?

00:50:01.802 --> 00:50:02.802
Alright.

00:50:08.658 --> 00:50:12.453
- Sir, let's follow up. Thank you.
- Yes, ma'am. No problem.

00:50:16.015 --> 00:50:18.392
- Ma'am?
- Yes, what is it, Lorenzo?

00:50:18.417 --> 00:50:20.211
Where do you want to put this painting?

00:50:20.260 --> 00:50:22.188
Maybe upstairs.

00:50:22.213 --> 00:50:23.881
At the right wing, second slot.

00:50:23.881 --> 00:50:25.174
- I got it.
- Alright.

00:50:25.788 --> 00:50:27.373
That painting is truly remarkable.

00:50:30.096 --> 00:50:31.597
Go ahead. Alright.

00:50:33.182 --> 00:50:34.350
That's why you look so familiar.

00:50:34.375 --> 00:50:35.918
I've seen that painting way back.

00:50:37.162 --> 00:50:38.538
What are you doing here?

00:50:39.480 --> 00:50:40.940
Remember, you told me

00:50:40.940 --> 00:50:42.441
you want to meet my whole family?

00:50:42.799 --> 00:50:45.635
Because you're interested
in learning my family's history.

00:50:46.445 --> 00:50:48.698
- Huh?
- Come, I'll introduce you now.

00:51:05.436 --> 00:51:08.565
Mr. Juanito asked to
be buried in this place.

00:51:09.109 --> 00:51:12.696
Because this is where
he'll wait for his beloved.

00:51:17.779 --> 00:51:19.322
I know everything now, Carmela.

00:51:20.978 --> 00:51:22.062
And I accept...

00:51:23.733 --> 00:51:25.109
That nothing could ever compare

00:51:25.109 --> 00:51:27.028
to your love for Mr. Juanito.

00:51:34.243 --> 00:51:35.494
I'll be going then.

00:51:35.494 --> 00:51:38.664
I might miss my flight to Italy.

00:51:39.373 --> 00:51:41.931
I will be an apprentice
under a chef at his restaurant.

00:51:43.102 --> 00:51:44.145
I'm happy for you.

00:51:44.170 --> 00:51:45.838
You'll get to fulfill your dream.

00:51:46.370 --> 00:51:48.039
I'm also happy for you.

00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:50.867
Future professor. Carmela Isabella.

00:51:53.846 --> 00:51:54.846
Take care.

00:52:25.343 --> 00:52:27.670
August 4,

00:52:28.356 --> 00:52:31.343
1963.

00:52:31.950 --> 00:52:33.389
Carmela, my beloved.

00:52:34.148 --> 00:52:37.869
It pains me whenever
I'm reminded about our situation.

00:52:38.702 --> 00:52:40.224
Because no matter what happens,

00:52:40.850 --> 00:52:42.356
no matter what I do,

00:52:42.794 --> 00:52:46.787
even if I were to stake my life, I know
I would never be able to be with you.

00:52:49.023 --> 00:52:52.277
It was too late when I learned
you weren't from this time.

00:52:53.449 --> 00:52:55.684
And that you were
brought here for a mission.

00:52:58.711 --> 00:53:00.685
Which is to save me from death.

00:53:10.076 --> 00:53:13.836
I learned about your secret
the day I read your letter.

00:53:14.575 --> 00:53:16.843
Where in you said,
you won't be able to come back.

00:53:17.953 --> 00:53:19.092
Along with this...

00:53:19.118 --> 00:53:21.137
Don Alejandro learned that

00:53:21.338 --> 00:53:25.371
there was a rebel that pretended
to be a guard in your home.

00:53:25.919 --> 00:53:27.725
We entered your home,

00:53:27.759 --> 00:53:30.118
to get the letter
I gave to you.

00:53:30.218 --> 00:53:32.826
Where I shared the whole
plan to you.

00:53:33.113 --> 00:53:35.145
So that it wouldn't be
taken in as evidence.

00:53:35.481 --> 00:53:38.907
That's when I saw your diary.

00:53:40.285 --> 00:53:44.636
I remembered you were
always carrying that diary.

00:53:45.040 --> 00:53:46.519
That's why I apologize

00:53:46.842 --> 00:53:49.762
for taking it,
because I wanted to read

00:53:49.992 --> 00:53:51.639
your inner thoughts.

00:53:51.961 --> 00:53:54.160
We learned from Eduardo

00:53:54.566 --> 00:53:59.108
that you and your family were heading
to Spain, along with some officials.

00:54:00.013 --> 00:54:02.340
That's why I followed you.

00:54:03.264 --> 00:54:04.264
Carmela.

00:54:04.403 --> 00:54:05.736
What do you mean, 'Carmela?'

00:54:05.874 --> 00:54:08.480
But I was surprised
when you suddenly pointed a gun at me.

00:54:08.651 --> 00:54:11.210
I also noticed the shift in your emotions.

00:54:11.241 --> 00:54:15.068
That's why I believed
what you wrote on your diary.

00:54:15.152 --> 00:54:17.433
That you're not Carmelita Montecarlos.

00:54:17.500 --> 00:54:19.567
Because you're Carmela Isabella.

00:54:20.284 --> 00:54:22.463
Who is from a different time.

00:54:22.610 --> 00:54:23.861
Don't come near me!

00:54:30.193 --> 00:54:31.194
Juanito...

00:54:35.841 --> 00:54:38.010
Even if you were not born in this era...

00:54:40.554 --> 00:54:42.264
You will still be the one I love.

00:54:47.527 --> 00:54:48.820
I hope I make you smile,

00:54:49.647 --> 00:54:52.024
because I fulfilled
my promise to you.

00:54:53.275 --> 00:54:54.902
I lived for a long time.

00:54:58.113 --> 00:55:00.282
And even though I am not
holding your hand now...

00:55:01.826 --> 00:55:02.868
Know that

00:55:03.118 --> 00:55:05.746
my heart will never let you go.

00:55:06.163 --> 00:55:09.708
Forgive me if I cannot wait for you anymore
at our meeting place.

00:55:12.169 --> 00:55:13.629
But always remember...

00:55:14.922 --> 00:55:17.007
That I love you very much, Carmela.

00:55:23.848 --> 00:55:27.518
This place, where everything
started, is the witness.

00:55:29.144 --> 00:55:31.146
I still love you, Juanito.

00:55:35.025 --> 00:55:36.652
Until we meet again, my beloved.

00:55:38.070 --> 00:55:41.574
With love, Juanito Alfonso.

00:55:48.539 --> 00:55:49.874
Dear Diary,

00:55:49.952 --> 00:55:53.538
thank you very much for everything
that you made me understand.

00:55:54.050 --> 00:55:57.095
Now I know that even if
there's a lot of deserving people,

00:55:57.161 --> 00:55:58.871
I was the chosen one.

00:56:02.386 --> 00:56:05.958
I learned to give importance
to people that surrounds me.

00:56:08.153 --> 00:56:10.881
I also learned to love truly.

00:56:14.523 --> 00:56:15.524
Juanito.

00:56:16.025 --> 00:56:20.525
I will forever cherish
what we have in my heart.

00:56:20.946 --> 00:56:23.616
You will be definitely that
last person I will truly love.

00:56:24.909 --> 00:56:27.161
I am Carmela Isabella,

00:56:27.186 --> 00:56:30.022
a spoiled feisty woman
who is bitter in love.

00:56:30.890 --> 00:56:32.099
But everything

00:56:32.124 --> 00:56:34.001
changed when I went to the

00:56:34.026 --> 00:56:35.736
year 1892.

00:56:45.304 --> 00:56:49.208
The woman in this painting
looks so much like my sister, Carmela.

00:56:49.651 --> 00:56:52.612
But that was painted in 1892.

00:56:53.646 --> 00:56:55.606
That's why it was a big mystery

00:56:55.606 --> 00:56:58.545
why its title became "Carmela Isabella."

00:56:59.071 --> 00:57:00.864
Who are those in the painting to the right?

00:57:01.111 --> 00:57:02.905
That is the Alfonso family.

00:57:03.280 --> 00:57:04.698
The family who were said to be

00:57:04.698 --> 00:57:08.077
the first to settle here in San Alfonso.

00:57:08.869 --> 00:57:11.288
I am Juanito Alfonso VI.

00:57:12.206 --> 00:57:14.875
But you can call me Jun.

00:57:16.126 --> 00:57:17.711
- Grandma!
- Oh, Carmela.

00:57:19.588 --> 00:57:21.757
Mom and I are going to the church.

00:57:21.782 --> 00:57:23.025
Do you want to come?

00:57:23.050 --> 00:57:25.778
Yes, I will come with you
and your Mommy to church.

00:57:25.803 --> 00:57:28.180
But the mass would be later.

00:57:28.205 --> 00:57:30.082
And your mommy is still sleeping.

00:57:30.543 --> 00:57:34.370
So, just play around here for now.

00:57:39.959 --> 00:57:40.964
Dad?

00:57:41.572 --> 00:57:43.832
And who is this

00:57:43.921 --> 00:57:47.257
handsome little gentleman?

00:57:47.282 --> 00:57:48.742
What's your name, child?

00:57:49.172 --> 00:57:50.245
Hey.

00:57:50.330 --> 00:57:51.623
Grandma is asking you.

00:57:51.870 --> 00:57:52.955
What is your name?

00:57:55.474 --> 00:57:56.596
It's Juanito.

00:57:57.167 --> 00:57:58.460
Apologies, grandma.

00:57:58.752 --> 00:58:01.046
This boy's really shy.

00:58:02.381 --> 00:58:04.675
Your child's name is
also Juanito Alfonso?

00:58:05.488 --> 00:58:06.640
Yes, grandmother.

00:58:06.802 --> 00:58:09.529
Juanito Alfonso VII.

00:58:09.680 --> 00:58:11.062
That's his name.

00:58:12.674 --> 00:58:14.286
Fascinating.

00:58:14.937 --> 00:58:15.966
By the way,

00:58:15.991 --> 00:58:19.356
I want to show you
the flowers in the garden.

00:58:19.381 --> 00:58:22.009
My sister Carmela planted those before.

00:58:22.317 --> 00:58:24.068
- Let's go.
- Alright.

00:58:24.181 --> 00:58:26.100
Juanito, you wanna come?

00:58:26.159 --> 00:58:27.494
I'll just stay here.

00:58:27.546 --> 00:58:28.546
Alright.

00:58:29.283 --> 00:58:30.534
Just explore.

00:58:30.559 --> 00:58:33.145
Look at the beautiful paintings.

00:58:34.079 --> 00:58:35.079
Alright then.

00:58:35.581 --> 00:58:36.793
- Let's go.
- Okay.

00:58:37.833 --> 00:58:39.126
Juanito, stay here, okay?

00:59:07.228 --> 00:59:08.228
Who is she?

00:59:08.566 --> 00:59:09.859
I don't know.

00:59:09.907 --> 00:59:11.033
Who are you anyway?

00:59:11.967 --> 00:59:14.682
My name is Juanito Alfonso VII.

00:59:14.798 --> 00:59:16.800
I will complain about you to my Dad

00:59:16.825 --> 00:59:18.105
because you're being mean to me.

00:59:18.557 --> 00:59:20.017
Then complain about me!

00:59:20.042 --> 00:59:23.131
I will also complain about
you to my Mom and Grandma.

00:59:23.921 --> 00:59:24.921
Carmela?

00:59:25.464 --> 00:59:26.965
Carmela's your name?

00:59:27.299 --> 00:59:30.094
Your name's so pretty.
It suits you.

00:59:30.479 --> 00:59:32.261
Too bad you're being mean.

00:59:32.286 --> 00:59:34.984
I didn't even do anything wrong.

00:59:36.433 --> 00:59:38.310
I have a secret to tell you.

00:59:38.644 --> 00:59:39.930
I have a third eye.

00:59:40.979 --> 00:59:42.856
It's true.
Come, quickly.

00:59:47.361 --> 00:59:48.361
Look at this.

00:59:48.403 --> 00:59:50.339
I'm the only one who can see

00:59:50.364 --> 00:59:52.212
and read what's inside.

00:59:52.673 --> 00:59:55.176
I told my Mom and Grandma about it,

00:59:55.285 --> 00:59:57.615
but they both can't read it.

00:59:58.055 --> 00:59:59.932
I'm the only one who can read it,

00:59:59.957 --> 01:00:02.042
which means,
my third eye's open.

01:00:15.848 --> 01:00:17.391
I can also read it.

01:00:17.724 --> 01:00:19.595
Really? What's written on it then?

01:00:20.853 --> 01:00:21.853
It says...

01:00:23.730 --> 01:00:25.065
Wow, that's cool!

01:00:25.090 --> 01:00:27.217
Both of our third eyes are open!

01:00:28.443 --> 01:00:29.603
What's that supposed to mean?

01:00:29.903 --> 01:00:32.281
This is the sign for
being happy and okay.

01:00:34.428 --> 01:00:35.450
Let's go outside.

01:00:35.450 --> 01:00:36.827
Maybe this isn't allowed.

01:00:36.852 --> 01:00:38.862
We might get reprimanded.
