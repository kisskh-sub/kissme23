WEBVTT

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:34.800
I'll kill you.

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.600
If this happens again,

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:42.960
I'll shoot you dead.

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:47.640
Go.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:57.880
Let me go.

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.800
Let me go.

00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:05.400
Huihui.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:06.600
Stop!

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:07.940
What are you doing?

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:08.580
Huihui.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:09.780
Huihui.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:12.480
What are you doing in front of the Colonel?

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.480
This crazy woman bit me!

00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:14.240
What are you doing here?

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.400
Sister Ying'er,

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.200
help me!

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:18.400
Where is your father?

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:19.120
Father

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:22.000
and my brother were killed by them.

00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:23.880
You must save me!

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.810
Sister Ying'er,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:25.720
please save me!

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.780
I'll take you away.

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:28.800
Miss Ye.

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:29.920
I'm sorry.

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:35.160
Captain Oshima ordered us to take this woman

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.520
to the police station immediately.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.000
I don't want to go!

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000
Comfort women

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.600
are all registered with the military.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.120
I don't want to go!

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:44.000
I'm taking her with me.

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000
I don't want to go!

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:46.560
Save me!

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:48.960
This is beyond my jurisdiction.

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:49.760
Take her away.

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.360
Sister Ying!

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:52.480
Sister Ying!

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:53.500
Please save me!

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.120
Don't you dare leave!

00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.320
Let her go!

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:56.960
Sister Ying!

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.960
Let go!

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.200
Save me, Sister Ying!

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:05.360
Sister Ying!

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:38.000
I thought you didn't care about anything.

00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.400
Why are you following me?

00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:40.760
You can't save them.

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.620
I'll go back and save them myself.

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:44.160
Let me go.

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.220
Let go of me.

00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.200
Release me.

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.240
I swear by my own judgment

00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.050
to keep the following oath.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.520
I swear that according to my ability

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:54.680
and judgment,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.160
I will keep this oath to benefit the sick

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.420
as my moral principle,

00:03:57.520 --> 00:03:58.600
to avoid all corruption

00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.680
and harm to others.

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:01.320
Wherever I go,

00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.280
regardless of whether my patients are male or female,

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.920
free citizens or slaves,

00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:06.200
I will treat them all equally.

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:07.600
I will seek their happiness

00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:08.760
as my only purpose.

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.800
I am willing to keep these oaths

00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.320
so that Apollo, the god of medicine,

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:13.320
Asclepius,

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.240
and all the gods may grant me life

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.959
and supreme glory in medicine.

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:18.399
If I break this oath,

00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.079
may I suffer

00:04:20.079 --> 00:04:22.480
the most severe judgment from all the gods.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.280
The Hippocratic Oath.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.000
Every doctor follows it.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.240
It speaks of compassion,

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:36.600
salvation,

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.880
and equality.

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.960
Please tell me,

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:46.720
have you ever seen a patient

00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.580
die right on the operating table?

00:04:50.440 --> 00:04:51.370
Of course I have.

00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:54.610
Why didn't you save him?

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.080
Doctors aren't omnipotent.

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.200
Neither am I.

00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:01.280
But you didn't even try.

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.160
How could you just...

00:05:05.320 --> 00:05:06.560
Acting on impulse

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.570
will only compromise our actions.

00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:12.840
Rash actions will only backfire.

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:16.160
I hope you never forget

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:17.820
why we came back to the island.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:21.360
We're already in grave danger.

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:23.440
If we make one wrong move,

00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:25.400
you, me, your family,

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.160
and the Major could all lose our lives.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.610
The Major came to China,

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.120
but what mission is he carrying?

00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:37.800
What kind of international operation is involved?

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.320
We know nothing about it.

00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:41.800
If this operation

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:43.720
truly has a decisive impact

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:45.000
on the entire Eastern front,

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:46.400
then it means we can only succeed.

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:47.480
Failure is not an option.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.600
Because if we fail,

00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.280
it will affect our entire country

00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:54.010
and the survival of our people.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:05:59.840
You are a smart

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.000
and innocent girl.

00:06:05.160 --> 00:06:08.880
Perhaps in the future you'll become complex,

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.880
sophisticated,

00:06:13.120 --> 00:06:15.880
cold and heartless like me.

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.860
I don't want to deliberately taint your innocence.

00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:25.400
I know it's your most precious quality.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:27.600
But

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.000
we need to survive first.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:31.800
Because only if we survive

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:33.880
can we possibly change this world.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.280
Only if we survive

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:38.360
can we protect those we love.

00:06:43.159 --> 00:06:43.600
Therefore,

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:45.200
I need to add something heavy

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.480
to your innocence.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:56.920
I'm sorry.

00:07:58.880 --> 00:07:59.560
Don't move.

00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:03.480
I'm sorry.

00:08:04.560 --> 00:08:05.600
Don't move.

00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.330
If you move, I won't be able to insert it properly.

00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:16.880
Get out.

00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.320
Get out.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:26.920
Nurse Tang,

00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:30.680
you have such a beautiful face.

00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.000
I'm working.

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:33.919
Please leave.

00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:38.200
You think

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:40.080
you can escape from me?

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.200
Nurse Tang,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.560
today you're still hoping...

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.490
Is that colonel coming to save you?

00:08:55.200 --> 00:08:57.720
Today you're already in my hands.

00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.680
I'd like to see who can save you now.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:04.890
I'm working.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:06.600
Please leave.

00:09:06.600 --> 00:09:07.760
Cooperate with us.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.480
Come with us.

00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:14.840
Let's go to the police station.

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.200
Captain Oshima has some questions for you.

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:21.480
Don't worry.

00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:26.680
I'll make sure you get what you deserve.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.200
I'm not going.

00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:31.480
You're not going?

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:32.760
You have to go anyway.

00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:34.720
Yes.

00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:42.840
Let me go!

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.160
I'm not going!

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.240
Let me go!

00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.840
What crime have I committed?

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:49.680
That doesn't matter.

00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:54.440
This is the face

00:09:54.440 --> 00:09:56.880
I've been thinking about for days.

00:09:57.440 --> 00:09:59.500
You've finally fallen into my hands.

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:01.680
You won't escape this time.

00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:05.880
Dr. Kozu.

00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.400
What are you doing here?

00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:08.200
Kozu.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:08.760
Hello there.

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:09.800
We're currently

00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.560
taking an important witness back to the station.

00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.440
Please don't interfere.

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:15.880
Dr. Kozu.

00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:17.560
Dr. Kozu.

00:10:18.960 --> 00:10:20.160
Let me go!

00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:23.440
Dr. Kozu.

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:35.560
Captain.

00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:36.600
Captain.

00:10:37.920 --> 00:10:38.800
Captain.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.880
We'll

00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:47.080
continue this next time.

00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:47.880
Yes.

00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:57.280
Did you find out

00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:57.880
why Colonel Takeki

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:58.840
came to our base?

00:11:00.280 --> 00:11:02.240
Deputy Sakamoto says

00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.320
Colonel Takeki's visit to the Sixth Air Base

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:07.760
is likely related to General Osumi's matter.

00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.200
It also involves

00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:12.800
the conflict between the Imperial Way Faction and the Control Faction,

00:11:12.800 --> 00:11:16.360
the Southern Expansion Faction and the Northern Expansion Faction,

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.280
and their power struggles.

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.640
What he brought

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:23.560
is a document

00:11:25.800 --> 00:11:28.400
personally signed by His Majesty the Emperor.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:31.960
He said

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.400
we must not

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:39.080
get involved in this matter.

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.360
Captain,

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.640
what should we do next?

00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:52.400
Let me think.

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.120
Colonel Wumu

00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.600
is an investigator from the Imperial Palace Chamberlain's Office

00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:08.160
and possesses investigation documents personally signed by the Emperor.

00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.200
Clearly he's from the Cabinet

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:12.440
Investigation Bureau.

00:12:12.440 --> 00:12:14.240
Cabinet Investigation Bureau.

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.640
If we continue this investigation,

00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:23.960
we'll likely get caught in power struggles between higher-ups.

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:26.600
We might become sacrificial lambs.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:29.120
So what should we do?

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.200
I have zero interest in power struggles at the top.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.720
Let the Colonel carry out his mission.

00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.720
Investigate this Ye Biying thoroughly

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:46.650
to prevent her from becoming a threat to the Colonel.

00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.840
If we uncover any issues with her,

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.360
the Colonel will surely be grateful.

00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.160
Also,

00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:00.800
have you found that American who fell from the plane?

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:01.720
Any news?

00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:03.920
This is still under investigation.

00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:05.880
What about

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:07.760
the missing sentinel?

00:13:08.800 --> 00:13:12.240
I will do my utmost to investigate, sir.

00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.740
Two people vanished into thin air

00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:29.220
after the Colonel and this woman arrived on the island.

00:13:48.960 --> 00:13:52.280
Why did you bring me here?

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:53.640
I want to go back.

00:13:54.120 --> 00:13:55.360
What did I do wrong?

00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:56.960
What have I done wrong?

00:13:57.360 --> 00:13:58.200
Darling,

00:13:58.200 --> 00:13:59.460
you look so energetic.

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.160
What's that?

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.210
Let's go check it out together.

00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:16.200
Why are you hesitating?

00:14:16.200 --> 00:14:16.720
Come on.

00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:17.760
Come on.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:19.480
Come on.

00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:25.880
Why did you bring me here?

00:14:27.560 --> 00:14:28.640
Come here.

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:29.520
This way.

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:31.320
Do you know her?

00:14:35.360 --> 00:14:36.360
Who is she?

00:14:39.840 --> 00:14:41.000
Be careful.

00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:42.920
You could be next.

00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:54.400
Which one should I choose?

00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.200
But this isn't enough.

00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:10.330
It's not hot enough.

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:12.320
This one is good.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.240
This is perfect.

00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:18.610
Deputy Captain.

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.720
Wait for me.

00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.120
Watch carefully.

00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.560
As expected of the Captain.

00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:49.000
Today they'll probably confess to everything.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.600
This is just routine procedure.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:54.480
Don't do anything to her.

00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.640
After all, her father

00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:57.560
is the chairman of the Maintenance Association.

00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:58.880
I know.

00:15:59.720 --> 00:16:02.160
Come to my office for a meeting after the interrogation.

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:02.560
Yes.

00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:12.760
Hey, you know who I'm talking about,

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:13.520
Mr. Li.

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:16.560
When you talk to the villagers in the future,

00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:19.200
don't be so aggressive.

00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:22.480
The Japanese are dangerous.

00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:23.680
We have to be careful around them.

00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:26.240
You see the villagers every day.

00:16:26.240 --> 00:16:27.520
What are you thinking?

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:28.960
What's going on here?

00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:32.080
Chairman Tang.

00:16:33.760 --> 00:16:34.360
Come here.

00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.680
Come here.

00:16:39.360 --> 00:16:40.680
Mr. Fukuda,

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.760
come in and have a drink with me.

00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:46.640
Come here.

00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:47.520
Mr. Fukuda.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.360
The Maintenance Association still has many matters to attend to.

00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:52.800
Perhaps we could meet another day?

00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.520
No need to reschedule.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:56.400
Today is perfect.

00:16:57.360 --> 00:16:59.600
The shop just received new merchandise today.

00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:00.800
Let me treat you to something fresh.

00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:02.160
Come here.

00:17:02.480 --> 00:17:03.360
Wait.

00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.440
You two go ahead.

00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:07.200
Hurry up.

00:17:08.359 --> 00:17:09.000
Go on.

00:17:10.119 --> 00:17:10.520
Come here.

00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.200
I'll do it.

00:17:11.560 --> 00:17:12.520
Come here.

00:17:17.680 --> 00:17:19.119
Bring the wine quickly.

00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:21.200
Sit down.

00:17:22.839 --> 00:17:23.440
Not this one.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.520
We need the special wine.

00:17:24.520 --> 00:17:25.200
Oh.

00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:41.800
That old guy

00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.720
turns into a mess after just a little alcohol.

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.160
If he were Japanese, he'd be ridiculed.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.080
Come here.

00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:57.120
Come here.

00:17:58.360 --> 00:17:58.960
Come here.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.200
Tang Ju'er.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:08.560
I'm back.

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:13.520
Let her go,

00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:15.680
I'll tell you everything.

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:19.060
Don't touch me.

00:18:19.280 --> 00:18:20.320
Don't touch me.

00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:22.600
I've told you.

00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:24.720
Good girl.

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:27.560
Put her down.

00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.840
Tang Ju'er.

00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.100
It's just the two of us now.

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.840
I've already said

00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:02.300
it's just the two of us now.

00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.200
It's just us two.

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:10.920
Let's go.

00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.480
I heard you want to challenge me.

00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:23.280
Have a drinking contest with me.

00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:26.760
I wouldn't dare.

00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:27.200
Sir,

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.240
I really can't.

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.120
Drink up.

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:31.930
[Drinks]

00:19:56.840 --> 00:19:58.080
I didn't mean to.

00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:58.760
Please spare me, sir.

00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.480
Have mercy!

00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.600
Drink.

00:20:21.560 --> 00:20:22.680
Sir,

00:20:22.680 --> 00:20:24.320
please spare me.

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:26.080
I can't drink anymore.

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.360
I told you to drink them.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.580
I really can't drink anymore.

00:20:48.360 --> 00:20:49.800
Don't move at all.

00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:54.240
Open your mouth.

00:20:57.600 --> 00:20:59.600
Don't move.

00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.520
Stay still.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.320
Sergeant, sir.

00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:19.440
Fukuda.

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:20.640
Who is this person?

00:21:20.640 --> 00:21:21.440
The interpreter.

00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:23.320
What brings you here?

00:21:24.840 --> 00:21:26.520
Commander Fujita

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:29.480
has always emphasized treating the island residents with leniency.

00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:32.560
Besides, Chairman Tang has been serving the Imperial Army all along.

00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:33.760
Please show mercy

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:34.880
and let him go.

00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.240
The Commander has repeatedly ordered

00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.200
that soldiers on the island are strictly forbidden to drink alcohol.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:41.330
Please mind your behavior, Corporal.

00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:45.960
Today's meal

00:21:45.960 --> 00:21:48.160
is on me, Fukuda.

00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:49.840
Please be merciful

00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:51.520
and go back to rest.

00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:56.600
I did it.

00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:24.120
Are you okay?

00:22:57.680 --> 00:22:58.880
Translator Luo.

00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:00.200
Have you heard

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:02.080
that Captain Daodao Hao

00:23:02.080 --> 00:23:05.080
raided the secret room in the Ye family's old house?

00:23:05.080 --> 00:23:07.140
I heard they confiscated quite a lot.

00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.160
Yes, I heard about it.

00:23:10.160 --> 00:23:10.840
Oh my,

00:23:11.320 --> 00:23:12.160
now

00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:15.800
will the Ye family fall into ruin?

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:19.120
Are you worried

00:23:19.120 --> 00:23:23.050
your daughter might live in poverty after marrying into their family?

00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.480
Marrying into the Ye family?

00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:28.120
I never agreed to that.

00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.880
I'm concerned about Old Master Ye.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:33.610
After all, he's a respected figure on the island.

00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:35.690
That's true.

00:23:43.840 --> 00:23:46.400
Could you be good to my daughter Ju'er?

00:23:50.280 --> 00:23:52.160
What do you mean?

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:54.160
In these troubled times,

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:55.960
a young girl out there

00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:58.560
always makes one worry.

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:00.800
Come.

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.760
Initially, I just wanted to work for the Japanese

00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:09.920
to be their messenger

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.520
to keep my daughter safe.

00:24:12.240 --> 00:24:13.920
But it seems that's not reliable.

00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:17.080
Unlike you, with your talents and wisdom.

00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:19.050
Even the Japanese respect you.

00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:20.400
You flatter me.

00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:23.180
The Japanese don't respect me at all.

00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.760
They're merely concerned about

00:24:24.760 --> 00:24:27.290
Commander Fujita's reputation, that's all.

00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:29.000
Living in chaotic times,

00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:30.600
I'm also just trying to survive.

00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:34.400
I had no choice but to take shelter under the Japanese military flag.

00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:36.400
Actually, I'm just like you.

00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:39.720
We all have to live by the Japanese whims.

00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:45.960
I'm old now.

00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.560
These old bones are useless.

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.280
If Ju'er could find someone like you to rely on,

00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:54.800
how wonderful that would be.

00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:55.240
Then

00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:57.760
I wouldn't have to worry constantly

00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:00.220
about her being mistreated by the Japanese.

00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:01.360
Come.

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.290
Let's not talk about this anymore.

00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:09.570
Translator Luo,

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:11.480
let me tell you,

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:14.200
my daughter Ju'er,

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:16.960
she's so filial

00:25:16.960 --> 00:25:18.120
at home.

00:25:18.120 --> 00:25:18.980
Chairman Tang.

00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:20.120
What's wrong,

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.100
Chairman Tang?

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:23.760
Ju'er has been taken by the police.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.120
How did Ju'er get taken by the police?

00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.200
I don't know.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:26.680
Let's go see.

00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:27.210
Let's go.

00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:28.880
Come on.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.600
Tang Ju'er.

00:25:39.360 --> 00:25:41.160
I'm giving you two options.

00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:46.000
Tell me everything you know,

00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:49.240
but don't tell a single lie.

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:54.240
I'm going to hand you over to my men

00:25:54.240 --> 00:25:56.760
and have them question you here.

00:25:57.560 --> 00:26:00.760
You can lie to them all you want.

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:03.280
I don't lie.

00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:05.400
I don't lie.

00:26:05.840 --> 00:26:06.640
Fine.

00:26:09.720 --> 00:26:11.960
Tang Ju'er, don't cry.

00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.560
Let's begin.

00:26:17.640 --> 00:26:18.400
Tell me

00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:22.320
what you know about Miss Ye.

00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.640
What do you want to know?

00:26:27.720 --> 00:26:28.360
Anything.

00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.960
Then let's start from childhood.

00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:39.240
I grew up with Biying.

00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:42.920
In 1936,

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.160
we left Sanzao Island for Guangzhou.

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:51.800
Then I went to nursing school.

00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:54.120
She...

00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:56.320
she attended women's normal school.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:57.920
At that time,

00:26:57.920 --> 00:27:00.080
we were often together.

00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.720
After the New Year,

00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:05.400
she asked me to go north with her.

00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.920
And then...

00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:07.920
Hey!

00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.920
Where exactly is 'north'?

00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:18.720
Everyone was saying Guangzhou would soon be at war.

00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:20.520
My father

00:27:21.240 --> 00:27:24.320
wrote to me asking me to return to Sanzao Island.

00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:26.520
He said Guangzhou wasn't safe,

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.440
so I didn't go.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:32.760
I'm asking you,

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:35.520
where exactly is 'north'?

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:42.440
You didn't go to Yan'an.

00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:43.800
In Shanghai,

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.100
to survive in Shanghai...

00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:47.720
I had no choice,

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.450
so I went to work at a dance hall.

00:27:49.520 --> 00:27:50.600
Ju'er.

00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:53.320
There's one more thing.

00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:58.080
If anyone asks about me in the future,

00:27:58.640 --> 00:28:00.200
just say you don't know.

00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.560
Where exactly is 'north'?

00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:07.520
Shanghai.

00:28:08.280 --> 00:28:09.240
Shanghai.

00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:11.600
Shanghai.

00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:15.600
Do you dare to lie?

00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.960
I'm not lying.

00:28:18.200 --> 00:28:19.080
Since that year,

00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:23.000
we haven't seen each other until she came back this time.

00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:25.640
Shanghai.

00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.360
Where in Shanghai?

00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:33.120
She said.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:34.160
She said.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:36.170
She said.

00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:42.960
She said at a dance hall.

00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:45.560
Do you dare to lie?

00:28:45.560 --> 00:28:46.400
I'm not lying.

00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:47.440
You're lying.

00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.240
I'm not.

00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:50.520
I'm not lying.

00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.600
Ju'er! Ju'er!

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:58.400
Stop!

00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.200
I'm looking for my daughter Ju'er.

00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:00.960
No entry.

00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.280
Tang Ju'er, where are you?

00:29:03.280 --> 00:29:06.120
Father!

00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:08.160
Father!

00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:09.480
Father, I'm here!

00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:11.600
Father!

00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:15.960
Keep an eye on her.

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:16.680
Yes, sir.

00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:20.600
Father, I'm here.

00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:25.280
Tang Ju'er, where are you? Ju'er!

00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:27.080
Hey! What are you doing?

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.600
What's going on?

00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:29.760
Captain.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:32.200
You've taken my daughter.

00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.240
Why are you locking her up?

00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:33.560
Let me tell you.

00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:34.440
Have you done anything to her?

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.280
Absolutely not.

00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:35.880
I want to see her.

00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:36.320
Go back.

00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.960
No, I just want to see my daughter.

00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:40.720
Let me through, please. Get out of my way.

00:29:48.760 --> 00:29:50.200
Why did you come here?

00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:51.760
What are you doing here?

00:29:51.760 --> 00:29:52.880
I didn't mean to.

00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:53.960
What do you mean 'didn't mean to'?

00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:55.480
I just want to see my daughter.

00:29:55.480 --> 00:29:56.800
Stop right there!

00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:01.080
Stop hitting him!

00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:02.740
I just want to see my daughter.

00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:11.200
The commander told you not to make trouble.

00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:12.920
What damn commander?

00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:15.200
None of the commander's business.

00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.360
Ju'er!

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.930
I'm looking for my daughter Ju'er.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.320
Bring him here.

00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:27.560
Don't move or I'll kill you.

00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.440
Stay still or I'll shoot.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:30.880
Captain.

00:30:31.280 --> 00:30:31.960
Wait.

00:30:33.840 --> 00:30:35.560
The chief wants to see you.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:50.160
Wait for me here.

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.690
All of you, wait for me here.

00:30:56.640 --> 00:30:58.280
Stand straight.

00:31:01.680 --> 00:31:03.440
That dog Tang Bingchen

00:31:03.440 --> 00:31:04.800
how dare he lay hands on me!

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.280
Calm down now.

00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:07.600
If you keep causing trouble like this,

00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:10.460
aren't you afraid the Commander will hear about it?

00:31:11.080 --> 00:31:12.520
I didn't think it through.

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:14.120
Did Tang Ju'er say anything?

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:14.920
No.

00:31:14.920 --> 00:31:16.160
Let her go for now.

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.000
Release her.

00:31:19.480 --> 00:31:21.280
Come back later for the meeting.

00:31:21.880 --> 00:31:23.680
Return for the meeting shortly.

00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:16.120
Is everyone here?

00:32:17.360 --> 00:32:18.280
Sasaki.

00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:19.720
Report to everyone

00:32:19.720 --> 00:32:22.250
about your situation at headquarters again.

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:26.320
I'll begin my report now.

00:32:26.480 --> 00:32:28.560
The Colonel's reason for coming to our island

00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:29.600
is related to

00:32:29.640 --> 00:32:33.240
General Minoru Osumi's plane crash last year.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:36.560
This matter may also involve

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:42.360
the internal conflict between the Imperial Way Faction and the Control Faction in the military.

00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:46.160
He brought investigation documents personally signed by the Emperor

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:51.960
to our Sixth Air Base.

00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:59.400
Therefore, we must not

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.280
get involved in this matter.

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:04.720
That's all Sakamoto told us.

00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:06.660
Report concluded.

00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:13.080
Originally, we had no suspicions

00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:15.240
about the Colonel from the Imperial Palace.

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:16.160
We were only concerned

00:33:16.160 --> 00:33:18.620
about the Chinese woman he brought with him.

00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:23.840
Did you all hear that?

00:33:26.600 --> 00:33:29.000
Does anyone among you know

00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:32.860
what the Imperial Way Faction and Control Faction are?

00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.680
That's right.

00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:45.360
We don't need to know about these

00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:50.440
meaningless power struggles at the top.

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:54.680
Just remember one thing:

00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:56.760
these internal conflicts,

00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.080
no matter which faction,

00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:00.360
we can't afford to offend any of them.

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:02.640
We don't need to make enemies everywhere.

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:05.600
Those bureaucrats

00:34:05.600 --> 00:34:07.280
would sacrifice our remote base

00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.210
and special police force officers

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.760
like stepping on an ant.

00:34:11.159 --> 00:34:15.320
The current situation is the calm before the storm.

00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:16.800
Don't cause any trouble.

00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:21.560
So,

00:34:22.199 --> 00:34:23.679
we've discovered so many

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:25.880
suspicious things about Colonel Wumu.

00:34:26.080 --> 00:34:30.760
And that woman from the Ye family

00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.440
also has many suspicious points.

00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:34.370
Are we not investigating any of it?

00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:41.360
Are you questioning the Emperor's investigator?

00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:44.679
That's not what I meant.

00:34:45.239 --> 00:34:46.280
I just want to know

00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.719
about that American who parachuted down.

00:34:47.719 --> 00:34:49.080
Do we not need to continue the investigation?

00:34:49.080 --> 00:34:50.840
What about the missing sentinel?

00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:52.679
Do we keep searching?

00:34:53.800 --> 00:34:56.330
These matters need to be handled separately.

00:34:56.880 --> 00:34:59.810
As for the person who jumped from the American plane,

00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.980
of course we must continue searching

00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:03.800
until we catch him.

00:35:04.560 --> 00:35:06.890
We need to conduct a high-profile search.

00:35:07.280 --> 00:35:08.920
That American

00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.120
is probably no longer in the village.

00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:16.080
So there must be a traitor in the village.

00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:20.800
Follow the trail and we'll smoke them out.

00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:25.240
What about the search for the missing sentinel?

00:35:25.800 --> 00:35:28.460
Leave it to the garrison to continue searching.

00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:31.760
We need to find him, dead or alive.

00:35:32.600 --> 00:35:35.920
As for the Ye family,

00:35:36.480 --> 00:35:38.320
we need to ease tensions.

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:39.480
Return all items

00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:42.140
confiscated yesterday from their secret room.

00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:45.120
Return everything?

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:48.920
Is there a problem?

00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.680
I understand.

00:35:52.160 --> 00:35:53.880
Did you really hear me?

00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:56.680
I'll return everything.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.360
Then go do it right away.

00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:00.680
Yes, sir.

00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:04.680
Meeting adjourned.

00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.400
Yes.

00:36:13.080 --> 00:36:13.920
Sasaki.

00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:15.000
Yes.

00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:15.960
Don't leave yet.

00:36:16.440 --> 00:36:16.920
Yes.

00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:27.120
Ju'er.

00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:33.480
Forget it.

00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.200
Just treat it like being bitten by a dog.

00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:39.520
This Inoue

00:36:41.080 --> 00:36:42.440
is truly despicable.

00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.560
Even bullying our family.

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:47.440
Tell me,

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:49.570
how can people on this island survive?

00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.360
Forget it.

00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.890
When you're under someone's roof,

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.800
who can avoid bowing their head?

00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:06.120
It seems that as chairman,

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.320
I'm not of much use anymore.

00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:11.920
When making marriage connections nowadays,

00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:13.640
you not only need equal social status,

00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.300
but also need strong backing.

00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:19.760
As for Ju'er,

00:37:19.840 --> 00:37:22.240
she really needs to find someone reliable.

00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:24.240
What worries me most now

00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.000
is my daughter Ju'er

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:27.760
in these chaotic times.

00:37:35.840 --> 00:37:36.770
Translator Luo,

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:39.880
you young people communicate better.

00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:41.320
Please go talk some sense into her.

00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:42.000
No, no, no.

00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:42.880
It's not appropriate for me to go.

00:37:42.880 --> 00:37:43.880
You should go instead.

00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:44.640
Come on.

00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:45.600
Translator Luo, I'm begging you.

00:37:45.600 --> 00:37:47.460
I'm begging you, Translator Luo.

00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:49.200
Please, I beg you.

00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.400
Go away.

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:06.600
Ju'er,

00:38:07.160 --> 00:38:08.480
don't be sad.

00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:16.240
Ju'er.

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:21.210
You'll harm your health if you go on like this.

00:38:26.840 --> 00:38:28.080
Listen to me.

00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.000
Life is short.

00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.440
One moment of patience can save you trouble.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.680
There's still a long way to go.

00:38:33.680 --> 00:38:34.480
Get out.

00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:35.760
I'm doing this for your own good.

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:36.960
Please leave.

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:41.520
Ju'er, be reasonable.

00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:44.680
Come, translator.

00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:45.610
Have some water.

00:38:46.440 --> 00:38:47.160
Or I can...

00:38:47.920 --> 00:38:48.600
Sit down.

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:50.280
Always drinking.

00:38:51.080 --> 00:38:51.600
Ju'er.

00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:52.960
Ju'er.

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:55.200
Where are you going?

00:39:07.400 --> 00:39:09.840
We have no way to investigate the Colonel.

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.520
This is really troublesome.

00:39:13.560 --> 00:39:15.320
To break this deadlock,

00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:19.690
we need to find that American as soon as possible.

00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.040
Alright.

00:39:24.240 --> 00:39:24.840
In the village,

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.900
Lieutenant Inoue has already led you

00:39:28.360 --> 00:39:30.200
on several searches.

00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:34.180
The Ye family, who are most likely to hide the American,

00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:35.960
yielded nothing as well.

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:39.520
So we should expand our search area.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.840
Now we need to make a show of force

00:39:42.840 --> 00:39:45.840
to get the Ye family to point us in the right direction.

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:50.560
Abandoned villages, caves,

00:39:50.560 --> 00:39:54.560
and coastal cliffs.

00:39:55.760 --> 00:39:57.280
All places that the Ye family can reach

00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:58.600
quickly from the village

00:39:58.600 --> 00:40:00.440
need to be thoroughly searched.

00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.840
Especially

00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:05.400
abandoned villages,

00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:08.290
which make the best hiding places.

00:40:09.120 --> 00:40:10.880
We just need the Ye family to give us a direction.

00:40:10.880 --> 00:40:11.720
Captain,

00:40:11.720 --> 00:40:13.200
first thing tomorrow morning,

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:14.680
I'll send the second platoon to Tanjia Bay.

00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:15.680
All right.

00:40:16.520 --> 00:40:17.280
By the way,

00:40:19.080 --> 00:40:19.800
please make arrangements

00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:21.840
to call Mr. Fukuda.

00:40:22.600 --> 00:40:25.960
I want to invite the Major to dinner at his place in the next few days

00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:27.690
to ease the tension between us.

00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.840
Bring Inoue along as well.

00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:34.760
Oh, and

00:40:36.320 --> 00:40:37.360
I need you to find

00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:38.280
all the files on General Osumi's plane crash

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.360
from last year.

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:43.000
Get it done quickly.

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:47.480
The Major will be transferred sooner or later anyway.

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.360
I understand.

00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:51.440
Go take care of it.

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:09.680
Xia'er.

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:11.800
Xia'er.

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:13.080
Yes, father.

00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.890
The pigeon is back. Let's go check.

00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:57.640
Great.

00:41:57.640 --> 00:41:59.440
Call your sister and the others.

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:16.320
I have good news for you.

00:42:18.640 --> 00:42:19.800
Major.

00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.260
We just need to hold on until tomorrow night.

00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:25.880
Why?
