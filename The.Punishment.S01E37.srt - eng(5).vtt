00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:35.310
Zhang Xin will be fine.

00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:36.370
No need to worry.

00:23:36.830 --> 00:23:37.590
Besides,

00:23:38.830 --> 00:23:40.880
I've started maneuvering
at the provincial level.

00:23:40.880 --> 00:23:43.070
The task force
won't be around for many more days.

00:23:43.070 --> 00:23:43.680
Also,

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:47.270
although you're currently
the acting director,

00:23:47.270 --> 00:23:50.330
with my support for your work,
you should be confident.

00:23:52.270 --> 00:23:53.070
Of course.

00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.750
Ye Tianyou has retired,

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:57.800
but his influence remains.

00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:00.360
For you to carry out your work smoothly,

00:24:00.790 --> 00:24:02.160
the key positions

00:24:02.590 --> 00:24:03.720
must be in your own hands.

00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:04.960
Use your own people.

00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:07.290
It has to be a solid, unbreakable unit.

00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:09.160
I understand.

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:10.770
Go back and tell them

00:24:11.640 --> 00:24:13.440
they must unify their thinking.

00:24:14.580 --> 00:24:15.350
By the way,

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.350
Sir,

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:18.590
today, I specifically brought
Captain Zhong Yanning

00:24:18.590 --> 00:24:20.650
of the Criminal Investigation Unit.

00:24:20.790 --> 00:24:22.750
He is a seasoned comrade in our bureau.

00:24:22.750 --> 00:24:24.540
He is very capable

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:26.110
and also very eager to advance.

00:24:26.110 --> 00:24:26.910
It's just that

00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.640
he hasn't had the opportunity
all these years.

00:24:28.640 --> 00:24:29.500
How about this?

00:24:29.750 --> 00:24:30.790
I'll ask him

00:24:31.030 --> 00:24:32.490
to report this case to you.

00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.880
He's waiting next door.

00:24:38.070 --> 00:24:38.590
Go.

00:24:44.400 --> 00:24:45.070
Zhong.

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:45.920
Yes.

00:25:02.030 --> 00:25:02.830
Hello, Sir.

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:04.920
I'm Zhong Yanning.

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:10.640
Xiaomei,

00:25:11.030 --> 00:25:12.880
your release on bail pending trial

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:14.440
was handled by Ms. Leng.

00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:19.140
Tell her everything you know.

00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:23.970
It will help with your sentence reduction
or probation in the future.

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:27.960
Don't worry.

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:29.130
Take your time.

00:25:29.790 --> 00:25:31.160
Tell me what you know.

00:25:31.590 --> 00:25:32.400
I'll help you.

00:25:45.790 --> 00:25:46.680
Xiaomei.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:48.930
I know

00:25:49.530 --> 00:25:51.290
this is very hard for you.

00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:55.700
You've been in Longwan for so many years.

00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:59.100
You're practically
a Longwan person by now.

00:26:04.130 --> 00:26:05.990
Ding Baoshuai ending up like this

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:09.270
is something none of us wants to see.

00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:14.180
But there are still so many young people
in Longwan.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:16.530
And our children

00:26:16.930 --> 00:26:18.740
will grow up in Longwan.

00:26:20.950 --> 00:26:23.190
We can't
let what happened to Ding Baoshuai

00:26:23.190 --> 00:26:24.880
happen to them again.

00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:28.710
For our children,

00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.480
and for yourself,

00:26:33.410 --> 00:26:35.570
tell us everything you know.

00:26:39.910 --> 00:26:42.050
I just finished eating that day

00:26:43.930 --> 00:26:45.660
and thought I'd go out for a walk

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:47.920
and wait for Xiaoshuai while I was at it.

00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:51.320
Then I saw them

00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:53.940
pushing a man into a room.

00:26:54.950 --> 00:26:56.990
So I went to see what was happening.

00:26:57.020 --> 00:26:58.420
What are you trying to do?

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:05.430
What did they say?

00:27:05.630 --> 00:27:07.290
I couldn't hear very clearly.

00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:08.640
I just...

00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:10.510
heard bits and pieces,

00:27:10.510 --> 00:27:12.220
something about...

00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.740
a female college student.

00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:16.330
She seemed to be someone's mistress.

00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:17.840
And she was pregnant.

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:22.350
She was... Ms. Zhang's assistant.

00:27:24.810 --> 00:27:25.380
Meng Yu,

00:27:25.410 --> 00:27:26.510
help Ms. Wen with her bag.

00:27:26.510 --> 00:27:27.110
Okay.

00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.440
She is...

00:27:30.650 --> 00:27:31.980
She's my new assistant.

00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:33.790
Xinrui has those work-study projects

00:27:33.790 --> 00:27:35.410
with a few universities.

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:36.680
She is good at foreign languages.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:37.590
She can work as an interpreter,

00:27:37.590 --> 00:27:39.310
so I kept her as my secretary.

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:41.690
Meng Yu, say hello to Ms. Wen.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:42.720
Hello, Ms. Wen.

00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:43.520
Hello. Hello.

00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:46.290
Your assistant—

00:27:46.440 --> 00:27:47.550
her name is Meng Yu, right?

00:27:47.550 --> 00:27:49.150
Why didn't she come with you?

00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.100
She resigned.

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:52.450
I know this person.

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:54.630
I saw her at the racecourse.

00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:58.110
But later I heard she resigned.

00:27:58.390 --> 00:27:59.990
Can you get in touch with her?

00:28:00.030 --> 00:28:02.160
I don't have her contact information.

00:28:02.930 --> 00:28:04.190
But I can think of a way.

00:28:09.180 --> 00:28:09.860
Xiaomei,

00:28:11.350 --> 00:28:12.640
many years ago,

00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:13.880
there was a girl

00:28:14.290 --> 00:28:16.490
who was also driven to her death by them.

00:28:17.290 --> 00:28:18.880
All these years, we investigators

00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:21.340
have been searching
for clues and evidence.

00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:24.440
What you told me today

00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:26.330
has given me great hope.

00:28:27.430 --> 00:28:28.160
Thank you.

00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:35.140
They... also mentioned another person.

00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:36.590
Mayor Hong.

00:28:38.850 --> 00:28:41.280
He seems to be the one behind them.

00:28:42.310 --> 00:28:43.440
They also said...

00:28:43.850 --> 00:28:46.980
something about holding overseas assets
or something.

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:52.100
Director Ye,

00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:53.830
based on the information
provided by Qin Feng,

00:28:53.830 --> 00:28:55.270
we have started the investigation.

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:56.960
Luo Xiaomei has also agreed to testify.

00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:59.000
The college student named Meng Yu—

00:28:59.590 --> 00:29:01.240
have you gotten in touch with her?

00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:02.160
It's a little difficult,

00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.160
but we are still trying to find a way.

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:05.690
Hong Mushou

00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.060
has been operating in Hanzhou
for so many years.

00:29:09.590 --> 00:29:10.390
He has friends

00:29:10.550 --> 00:29:12.070
and social connections.

00:29:12.270 --> 00:29:14.930
We are not facing just him alone,

00:29:15.070 --> 00:29:16.550
but an interest group of dozens,

00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:18.790
even hundreds of people.

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:21.480
If these people fight back,

00:29:21.550 --> 00:29:23.270
it will be like a flood of wild beasts,

00:29:23.270 --> 00:29:24.460
a towering wave.

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:25.750
At this stage

00:29:25.920 --> 00:29:27.180
of the investigation,

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:28.310
every step we take

00:29:28.590 --> 00:29:30.720
is like scraping the bone
to heal the wound—

00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:31.850
extremely painful,

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.170
but absolutely necessary.

00:29:37.170 --> 00:29:37.760
Ye.

00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:40.310
I just got a call.

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:42.540
As soon as Chen Shuifa got into trouble,

00:29:42.540 --> 00:29:45.030
Hong Mushou rushed to his mentor's home
in the provincial capital that very night.

00:29:45.030 --> 00:29:47.690
The leadership told us
to prepare for the worst.

00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:50.410
This might be our last chance.

00:29:51.030 --> 00:29:51.960
What do you mean?

00:29:53.590 --> 00:29:54.590
The task force...

00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:57.130
might be withdrawn at any moment.

00:29:58.720 --> 00:30:00.960
We finally managed to uncover these leads.

00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.270
So many people have investigated
for so many years.

00:30:03.270 --> 00:30:04.740
My disciples and I

00:30:05.030 --> 00:30:06.510
have risked our lives for this.

00:30:06.510 --> 00:30:07.920
We're going to reveal the truth soon.

00:30:07.920 --> 00:30:09.450
How can they just withdraw?

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.610
The leadership said over the phone

00:30:15.070 --> 00:30:16.230
that someone
with very significant influence

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:17.730
spoke up for Hong Mushou.

00:30:18.070 --> 00:30:19.030
We are under...

00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:21.160
a lot of pressure.

00:30:22.350 --> 00:30:24.400
No wonder our investigation
has kept hitting roadblocks lately.

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:26.110
Every department paid lip service.

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:27.350
They said all the right things,

00:30:27.350 --> 00:30:29.400
but they just wouldn't cooperate with us.

00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:30.440
They have extended their hands

00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:32.680
into every corner of Hanzhou.

00:30:33.160 --> 00:30:34.240
This fight

00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:35.920
is not about winning or losing.

00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:36.830
It's about life and death.

00:30:36.830 --> 00:30:39.160
It determines
the future development of Hanzhou

00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.750
and is a decisive battle
for the livelihoods

00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:43.750
of millions of Hanzhou's citizens.

00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:46.110
We're just one step away.

00:30:46.550 --> 00:30:47.950
No matter the obstacles,

00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:50.360
we will see this through to the very end.

00:30:50.790 --> 00:30:51.440
Okay.

00:30:52.030 --> 00:30:53.290
I'll buy you more time.

00:30:53.350 --> 00:30:54.750
I'll shoulder the pressure from above.

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:55.950
But you have to hurry.

00:30:56.790 --> 00:30:58.310
Find a breakthrough as soon as possible.

00:30:58.310 --> 00:30:58.880
Okay.

00:30:59.570 --> 00:31:00.250
-Okay.
-Yes.

00:31:00.250 --> 00:31:01.630
[Registered Population Form
Name: Meng Yu]

00:31:01.630 --> 00:31:03.890
Xu Li was about this age back then, right?

00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.480
Yes, around the same age.

00:31:10.790 --> 00:31:13.200
I didn't dare
report it to the police at first.

00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.790
But my good friend insisted

00:31:14.790 --> 00:31:16.350
that I report it.

00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:17.850
Don't be afraid.

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:19.440
We will help you.

00:31:22.270 --> 00:31:22.960
Xu Li.

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:24.760
Don't be afraid.

00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:26.550
So,

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:28.820
the most crucial thing now

00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.880
is to find the person in that sketch.

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:33.270
No matter what kind of monster
is behind him,

00:31:33.270 --> 00:31:34.400
we'll take him down.

00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:37.030
It's been 12 years.

00:31:39.030 --> 00:31:40.720
A full cycle.

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:43.690
I've had nightmares for 12 years.

00:31:44.590 --> 00:31:47.310
This person has been harming people
for 12 years.

00:31:47.310 --> 00:31:49.110
We're about to catch him,

00:31:49.720 --> 00:31:51.580
but the task force was withdrawn.

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:56.710
I guess Chu Qingtong
is not that impressive at all.

00:31:56.710 --> 00:31:58.070
He put on airs all day long.

00:31:58.070 --> 00:31:59.350
I thought he was tough.

00:31:59.570 --> 00:32:02.600
All show and no substance!
What a piece of work!

00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:03.880
Don't talk nonsense!

00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:05.920
Stop cursing him. What's the use?

00:32:07.680 --> 00:32:08.270
Qin Feng!

00:32:09.590 --> 00:32:10.850
Don't act recklessly!

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:31.400
Tianye.

00:32:32.510 --> 00:32:33.640
The police are here.

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.130
You go first.

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:36.920
I'll send someone to escort you out.

00:32:36.920 --> 00:32:38.320
Forget it. It's too late.

00:32:39.550 --> 00:32:40.280
Don't worry.

00:32:40.790 --> 00:32:42.920
I've taken care of everything for you.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.360
They won't discover you.

00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:47.790
Don't always think
about winning or losing.

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:49.790
It's time to think about the future.

00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.350
Tianye.

00:32:52.270 --> 00:32:52.920
Take care.

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.200
Are you Zhou Sisi?

00:33:08.030 --> 00:33:08.590
Yes.

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.090
Please come with us.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:23.720
Tianye.

00:33:24.590 --> 00:33:27.920
The gift for Director Peng
has been signed for and received.

00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:38.560
[Deputy Director's Office]

00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:41.100
Director Peng.

00:33:42.110 --> 00:33:43.160
There's a delivery for you.

00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:44.780
I saw it downstairs and...

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.250
brought it here for you.

00:33:48.310 --> 00:33:49.370
What is this thing?

00:33:50.550 --> 00:33:51.750
Are you sure it's for me?

00:33:51.750 --> 00:33:54.280
It is for you.
Look, your name is written on it.

00:33:54.790 --> 00:33:56.070
It feels

00:33:56.070 --> 00:33:57.240
like a painting.

00:33:58.310 --> 00:33:59.480
Should I open it for you?

00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.200
A painting?

00:34:01.270 --> 00:34:01.880
Open it.

00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:02.580
Okay. Okay.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.310
It really is a painting.

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:11.010
It's oriented horizontally.

00:34:11.010 --> 00:34:12.440
Here, let me put it here.

00:34:13.710 --> 00:34:14.840
Put it here.

00:34:17.100 --> 00:34:18.070
[The Beginning, The End]

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:20.130
What's the meaning of this painting?

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:25.400
The beginning?

00:34:25.670 --> 00:34:26.440
The end?

00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:41.090
Your new identity.

00:34:42.489 --> 00:34:44.800
[The Beginning, The End]

00:34:45.550 --> 00:34:47.199
This name is good. I like it.

00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.710
It doesn't mean anything special.

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:52.969
It's just an abstract.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:56.820
Director Peng,

00:34:57.030 --> 00:34:59.090
this painting is for you.

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:00.830
So between these two people,

00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:02.150
one must be you.

00:35:02.670 --> 00:35:04.230
Then who is the other person?

00:35:04.230 --> 00:35:05.320
Didn't I tell you?

00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:07.660
Abstract art is like this.

00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:09.880
He looks like
whoever you think he looks like.

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.440
I even think he looks like you.

00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:12.500
Both look like you.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:14.300
Director Peng,

00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:15.800
stop joking.

00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:17.350
How could that possibly be me?

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:19.390
[The Beginning, The End]

00:35:39.230 --> 00:35:40.030
What's wrong?

00:35:41.110 --> 00:35:42.440
You don't like the gift?

00:35:43.710 --> 00:35:45.150
I had it painted by a famous artist.

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:46.110
If you don't like it,

00:35:46.110 --> 00:35:48.310
I'll have someone else paint it for you.

00:35:49.070 --> 00:35:50.200
It was painted well.

00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:52.920
Well, Liu Tianye,

00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:55.660
do you want to die?

00:35:58.480 --> 00:35:59.110
Here.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.550
If you want to die,

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.600
I'll grant your wish.

00:36:04.230 --> 00:36:06.070
I'll kill you right now!

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:07.710
If I die,

00:36:08.110 --> 00:36:09.710
many people will die with me.

00:36:11.110 --> 00:36:11.990
Over the years,

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:14.610
I've gathered quite a lot in my hands.

00:36:15.110 --> 00:36:16.570
If anything happens to me,

00:36:16.590 --> 00:36:17.850
no one will end up well.

00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:19.880
Do you have to push me like this?

00:36:21.190 --> 00:36:23.320
You want to force me to my death,
is that it?

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:25.650
There's no grudge between us, Liu Tianye!

00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:27.260
How about this?

00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:28.080
Here, take it!

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.310
Just kill me!

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:31.920
Kill me

00:36:32.470 --> 00:36:33.670
and I'll be free!

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:35.510
Okay?

00:36:39.110 --> 00:36:41.170
Everyone needs to rest at some point,

00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:42.760
but not now.

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:46.200
Well, what do you want?

00:36:48.550 --> 00:36:49.960
Hanzhou is only this big!

00:36:51.430 --> 00:36:53.430
Where do you want to plant your flag?

00:36:54.710 --> 00:36:56.240
Plant it on the boss's head?

00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:00.920
That works too.

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.160
My demand is very simple.

00:37:07.150 --> 00:37:09.080
I just want to finish all the things

00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.080
I've planned.

00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:19.280
Let me be honest with you.

00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:22.480
The boss has made it very clear.

00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:25.230
They want to make Tianyun
an ironclad case.

00:37:25.230 --> 00:37:26.690
It's not just aimed at you.

00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:29.710
The entire Longwan...

00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:32.510
will be completely taken down.

00:37:32.510 --> 00:37:33.570
Do you understand?

00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:36.710
Take my advice:

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:39.150
leave quickly.

00:37:39.670 --> 00:37:41.110
The farther, the better.

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:43.480
This is my...

00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:46.270
final advice for you.

00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:03.840
This is the original version
of that photo.

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:04.900
Only this one copy.

00:38:05.590 --> 00:38:06.360
Take it.

00:38:07.510 --> 00:38:08.970
It's of no use to me anyway.

00:38:18.880 --> 00:38:19.740
Director Peng.

00:38:21.150 --> 00:38:22.480
I have only one request.

00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:25.480
Don't touch Longwan.

00:38:28.510 --> 00:38:29.630
I'll try my best.

00:39:03.710 --> 00:39:04.440
Tianye.

00:39:06.190 --> 00:39:09.050
The ECID has started
investigating Tianyun Group.

00:39:09.590 --> 00:39:10.320
Many of our accounts

00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:12.320
have already been sealed or frozen.

00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:14.170
Vice President Song is hiding.

00:39:14.230 --> 00:39:16.000
Even Mr. Wei has been arrested.

00:39:18.670 --> 00:39:20.870
Editor-in-Chief Zhang is truly a jerk.

00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:22.490
He wrote an article,

00:39:23.620 --> 00:39:23.760
[Uncovering the Truth
Behind the Hangang Center Collapse]

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:24.820
digging up dirt on us.

00:39:24.820 --> 00:39:26.050
[Exposing the Violent Acts
of Tianyun Group, a Criminal Syndicate]

00:39:28.070 --> 00:39:29.600
The tree hasn't fallen yet,

00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:32.060
and the monkeys are already scattering.

00:39:34.550 --> 00:39:35.350
Tianye,

00:39:35.950 --> 00:39:37.150
what do you plan to do?

00:39:37.670 --> 00:39:39.150
Find all the previously used accounts

00:39:39.150 --> 00:39:40.480
and those documents.

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:41.970
Dispose of them all.

00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:46.070
In the next couple of days,

00:39:46.070 --> 00:39:47.440
you two also get ready.

00:39:47.480 --> 00:39:49.140
I'll arrange for you to leave.

00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:53.140
What about you?

00:39:54.510 --> 00:39:55.810
Peng Hanzhang told me

00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:58.450
the boss is determined
to bring down Tianyun.

00:39:59.030 --> 00:40:00.760
He won't spare Longwan either.

00:40:01.190 --> 00:40:03.320
So I need to bring him down

00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.850
before any of that happens.

00:40:06.190 --> 00:40:08.030
Have you found all the people I asked for?

00:40:08.030 --> 00:40:09.440
I've arranged everything.

00:40:09.440 --> 00:40:11.040
All from Longwan. Reliable.

00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:12.590
I also asked people

00:40:12.590 --> 00:40:14.050
to keep an eye on our homes.

00:40:27.190 --> 00:40:27.840
Taoyi.

00:40:29.590 --> 00:40:31.050
Have you made up your mind?

00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:35.060
Tianye said he's not leaving.

00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:36.880
Then I'm not leaving either.

00:40:41.650 --> 00:40:42.710
I plan to turn myself in.
