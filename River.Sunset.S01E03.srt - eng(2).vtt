WEBVTT

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:34.799
Fire all these bullets.

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:38.480
Don't waste them.

00:01:38.599 --> 00:01:39.200
Finish them.

00:01:51.400 --> 00:01:52.040
Did you hit it?

00:01:53.159 --> 00:01:53.680
Continue.

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.000
Report the target.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.359
All misses.

00:02:05.359 --> 00:02:06.640
Come here.

00:02:07.519 --> 00:02:08.039
Come over.

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:13.360
Miss.

00:02:15.759 --> 00:02:16.319
Here.

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.639
Miss.

00:02:19.919 --> 00:02:20.400
Come here.

00:02:21.439 --> 00:02:22.280
Hit the bullseye.

00:02:23.039 --> 00:02:23.639
Continue.

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:26.560
So close.

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.400
Bullseye.

00:02:32.039 --> 00:02:32.960
One shot, one kill.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.120
This is your optimal firing distance.

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:36.560
You must remember.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.919
On the battlefield, at any time,

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:39.680
if you're not confident,

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:40.599
maintain this stance

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:42.080
and approach the enemy.

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.439
Xiao Ye.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.879
All I can teach you

00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.159
is just this.

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:55.759
Thank you.

00:02:56.159 --> 00:02:57.039
Keep this gun.

00:02:57.879 --> 00:02:58.680
You're giving it to me?

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:00.879
Thank you.

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:02.879
Let's go.

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.919
Comrade Xiao Ye.

00:03:19.639 --> 00:03:20.680
Let me introduce you.

00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.879
This is Director Shen

00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:24.280
of the Bureau of Military Statistics.

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:26.960
Hello, sir.

00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.199
No need for formalities, Comrade Xiao Ye.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:33.159
Minister Li praised you for quite a while just now.

00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:34.520
He thinks very highly of you.

00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:36.120
Well, Minister Li,

00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:37.759
may I take her back now?

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.560
Yes.

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:41.439
Director Shen.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.800
I'll just emphasize one thing.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.560
You must return her safe and sound.

00:03:49.439 --> 00:03:50.199
You have my word.

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.520
Then I'll take Comrade Xiao Ye back first.

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.199
Alright.

00:04:09.719 --> 00:04:11.960
Minister Li, farewell.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.720
Director Shen.

00:04:31.079 --> 00:04:32.600
Where are we going now?

00:04:32.959 --> 00:04:35.600
To the Zaozi Lanya Juntong Compound.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:37.800
Miss Ye.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:38.680
There's no need to be nervous.

00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:40.800
This mission is small

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.839
and very simple.

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:45.040
It's been many years since you've been back home, right?

00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:48.360
Many years.

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.800
Just treat it as going home to visit family.

00:05:19.519 --> 00:05:20.360
Hurry up.

00:05:23.959 --> 00:05:24.800
Miss Ye.

00:05:24.959 --> 00:05:27.040
In a moment, Xiao Wang will take you to the office first.

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:28.639
I'll be there shortly.

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:31.000
Do I have to be like them too?

00:05:31.759 --> 00:05:32.920
I'll tell you in a moment.

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:36.040
You don't need to wear that for now.

00:05:42.399 --> 00:05:43.240
Pay attention to the movements.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.199
Everyone, remember the key points of the movements.

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.319
Director.

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:49.720
The person has been retrieved.

00:05:49.839 --> 00:05:50.600
Very smoothly.

00:05:50.959 --> 00:05:52.279
What do you think?

00:05:53.439 --> 00:05:54.879
She's truly just an amateur.

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:56.720
Would you like to meet her?

00:05:57.759 --> 00:05:58.639
No need.

00:05:59.079 --> 00:06:00.040
You handle it.

00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:00.720
Alright.

00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.240
So, Miss Ye.

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:08.959
Getting used to it?

00:06:15.319 --> 00:06:16.360
To complete the mission,

00:06:16.839 --> 00:06:17.600
this time we

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:19.439
have prepared a cover identity for you.

00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:20.839
From now on,

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.800
you are a surgeon

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.000
at Shanghai's Ruihua Hospital.

00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:25.879
The hospital's details,

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.720
your relationships with colleagues,

00:06:27.879 --> 00:06:30.160
and all aspects of your life in Shanghai

00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.519
are all written here.

00:06:31.519 --> 00:06:32.959
Memorize them as soon as possible.

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.720
What I say next is especially important.

00:06:36.879 --> 00:06:38.360
Due to your work,

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:40.600
you met Mr. Tang Shengming.

00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.360
He is a senior advisor in the Wang regime.

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:45.319
He holds significant power in Shanghai.

00:06:45.319 --> 00:06:46.879
He was once your patient.

00:06:46.879 --> 00:06:47.959
On March 12th,

00:06:47.959 --> 00:06:49.720
you met a gentleman in Shanghai

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.639
named Mr. Wu, who wears a suit.

00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:55.639
Through his usual interactions with you, Mr. Tang

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:57.720
learned that you are from Sanzao Island

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:58.800
in Zhongshan County, Guangdong.

00:06:59.240 --> 00:07:00.879
A friend of his, Mr. Wu,

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.720
happened to have business on the island

00:07:02.839 --> 00:07:03.920
and needed to find

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.920
a local familiar with the island.

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.519
So Mr. Tang introduced

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:08.680
the two of you.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:10.120
This Mr. Wu,

00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:11.920
full name Takeki Ichiro,

00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:14.120
is a senior Japanese officer.

00:07:14.399 --> 00:07:16.399
How could I know a Japanese person

00:07:16.399 --> 00:07:17.600
and become friends with him?

00:07:18.279 --> 00:07:19.040
Miss Ye.

00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.879
Review the materials above as quickly as possible.

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:22.560
You cannot leave this room.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.120
You cannot take the materials out.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:24.839
At the door are our

00:07:24.839 --> 00:07:26.759
guards responsible for your safety.

00:07:26.959 --> 00:07:28.720
You can approach them for anything.

00:07:29.079 --> 00:07:30.519
In half an hour,

00:07:30.839 --> 00:07:33.319
we have several basic training exercises.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.240
Change into this set of clothes.

00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.319
Do you like painters?

00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:40.120
No.

00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:42.839
Second one, Second Lieutenant.

00:07:43.519 --> 00:07:44.240
Second Lieutenant.

00:07:44.839 --> 00:07:46.360
The third one is also a Second Lieutenant.

00:07:46.759 --> 00:07:47.519
Second Lieutenant.

00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:48.560
The second one.

00:07:49.639 --> 00:07:51.000
Navy officer's service cap.

00:07:52.279 --> 00:07:53.680
Navy Rear Admiral shoulder boards.

00:07:54.439 --> 00:07:56.279
Navy Lieutenant Commander shoulder boards.

00:07:57.600 --> 00:07:58.160
This one.

00:07:59.639 --> 00:08:00.399
Miss Ye.

00:08:00.839 --> 00:08:01.879
Next,

00:08:02.199 --> 00:08:03.319
we will conduct

00:08:03.319 --> 00:08:06.079
a basic training on tailing and counter-tailing.

00:08:06.920 --> 00:08:07.959
When tailing someone,

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:08.800
you must memorize

00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:10.680
all their characteristics.

00:08:11.439 --> 00:08:12.560
Even in

00:08:12.560 --> 00:08:13.519
crowded places,

00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:14.959
you cannot lose them.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.759
Just follow this woman.

00:08:17.319 --> 00:08:18.160
The woman in the cheongsam.

00:08:18.399 --> 00:08:18.920
Follow her.

00:08:28.079 --> 00:08:29.000
Sorry.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:32.799
This is the positive terminal.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:34.080
This is the negative terminal.

00:08:34.759 --> 00:08:35.840
After you connect it,

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.759
just press down directly.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.039
You connect it.

00:08:39.559 --> 00:08:40.399
Okay, connect it here.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:42.519
When you press it down,

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:43.759
don't be afraid either.

00:08:43.879 --> 00:08:45.080
This is a training round.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.120
It's not dangerous.

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.120
Good, now you try it.

00:11:18.879 --> 00:11:19.600
Mother.

00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:21.360
I'm leaving.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:03.840
Director Shen.

00:12:04.559 --> 00:12:06.000
He asked me to bring these materials over.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:06.879
Please familiarize yourself with them.

00:12:08.519 --> 00:12:09.159
However,

00:12:10.039 --> 00:12:10.960
you can only read them here.

00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:11.720
You cannot take them out.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:15.720
The Director has ordered action after breakfast today.

00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.639
The Director has ordered action after breakfast today.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:20.039
You will depart with him.

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.759
First, fly to the Changde Lixian Airport.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:24.799
Then transfer from Changde Lixian to a river steamer to Shanghai.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.559
It's like this, Miss Ye.

00:12:31.879 --> 00:12:33.279
Everyone who trains here

00:12:33.279 --> 00:12:35.960
undergoes a political screening interview.

00:12:36.679 --> 00:12:38.039
And fills out some forms.

00:12:41.879 --> 00:12:43.039
Fills out some forms.

00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:44.799
This is just routine procedure.

00:12:45.279 --> 00:12:47.840
Just give them to me after you finish.

00:12:48.919 --> 00:12:51.679
Name, native place, social connections.

00:12:53.039 --> 00:12:54.039
And the oath.

00:12:55.279 --> 00:12:57.320
You just copy it verbatim.

00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:01.039
This oath

00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:04.200
is only to deepen the trainee's impression,

00:13:05.159 --> 00:13:07.080
constantly reminding the person filling the form

00:13:08.559 --> 00:13:10.480
not to forget their mission.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.480
I keep my vow.

00:13:28.559 --> 00:13:31.000
I was not summoned.

00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:33.159
No angel informed me.

00:13:33.399 --> 00:13:37.240
With my rose, I swear again

00:13:37.480 --> 00:13:39.840
by every sacred bee,

00:13:39.960 --> 00:13:43.039
by the daisies called from the hillside.

00:13:43.679 --> 00:13:44.759
Who told you to improvise?

00:13:48.639 --> 00:13:49.360
I know.

00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:51.559
After I finish the forms,

00:13:51.559 --> 00:13:52.960
and attach my photo,

00:13:53.639 --> 00:13:55.039
I become one of your people?

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.320
I am an Eighth Route Army medic.

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.240
I won't be fooled.

00:13:59.919 --> 00:14:00.879
Miss Ye,

00:14:01.639 --> 00:14:04.080
we are not asking you to join the Nationalist Party either.

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.159
If you fill out this form,

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:07.200
we can

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:09.200
assign you a specific military rank.

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.120
In case you fall into Japanese hands,

00:14:11.759 --> 00:14:15.200
having a rank is better than having none.

00:14:22.919 --> 00:14:24.399
The Japanese in Nanjing

00:14:24.399 --> 00:14:26.240
killed so many Chinese soldiers.

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.799
Didn't those people have ranks?

00:14:36.039 --> 00:14:37.200
This woman is very stubborn.

00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:38.960
Unwilling to fill out this form.

00:14:39.759 --> 00:14:41.480
Wrote these things on it.

00:14:42.759 --> 00:14:45.879
During the Nationalist-Communist cooperation, each takes what they need.

00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:47.120
Let it be.

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:46.159
Miss Ye.

00:15:46.159 --> 00:15:47.279
It's windy outside.

00:15:47.279 --> 00:15:47.919
Put this on.

00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:50.279
Thank you.

00:15:50.559 --> 00:15:51.480
Are you seasick?

00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.559
A little uncomfortable.

00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.279
Look at the horizon, you'll be fine.

00:15:57.279 --> 00:15:58.440
Don't look at the sea.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:02.240
I have a gift for you.

00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:07.399
This is a Browning M1906 Pocket Pistol.

00:16:07.879 --> 00:16:08.960
It can use the same type of ammunition

00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:11.080
as the one you were issued.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:16.159
Many of our female field agents in the Bureau

00:16:16.159 --> 00:16:17.440
like to carry it.

00:16:17.559 --> 00:16:18.320
They place it

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:20.240
inside their stockings, on the inner thigh.

00:16:20.679 --> 00:16:21.720
That way it's more concealed.

00:16:25.159 --> 00:16:27.039
I hope it can save your life

00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:28.600
at a critical moment.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:30.720
Thank you.

00:16:35.279 --> 00:16:37.080
Takeki Ichiro knew

00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:40.279
that from the moment he was activated,

00:16:40.279 --> 00:16:43.240
he might have bid his mother farewell forever.

00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:44.080
He knew

00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:46.759
that whether he could return alive or not,

00:16:46.919 --> 00:16:50.399
his profession did not allow him to be indecisive

00:16:50.399 --> 00:16:52.039
or cling to sentiment.

00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:53.360
Now,

00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:55.519
there were more important things than family bonds

00:16:55.519 --> 00:16:56.879
waiting for him to do.

00:16:57.159 --> 00:16:59.679
He had lain dormant for nearly ten years,

00:16:59.919 --> 00:17:03.360
quietly staying by his mother's side to fulfill his filial duty,

00:17:03.559 --> 00:17:05.079
all for this day.

00:17:05.519 --> 00:17:08.559
It was time for him to serve his country with loyalty.

00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:09.640
Excuse me.

00:17:10.519 --> 00:17:12.240
May I sit here?

00:17:12.920 --> 00:17:13.519
Please.

00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.920
Are you an officer too?

00:17:20.160 --> 00:17:21.319
Which unit are you from?

00:17:22.039 --> 00:17:22.640
Colonel, sir.

00:17:23.279 --> 00:17:24.279
Here is today's newspaper.

00:17:24.279 --> 00:17:24.880
Would you like it?

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:26.359
Thank you.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.240
Colonel, sir.

00:17:30.519 --> 00:17:31.519
Colonel, sir.

00:17:31.880 --> 00:17:32.880
Colonel, sir.

00:17:34.400 --> 00:17:35.279
Everyone, take your seats quickly.

00:17:37.119 --> 00:17:37.640
Sit.

00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:06.319
This aircraft can only carry

00:18:06.319 --> 00:18:07.240
seven hundred gallons of fuel.

00:18:07.240 --> 00:18:08.519
That is far from enough.

00:18:10.039 --> 00:18:10.359
The subsequent

00:18:10.359 --> 00:18:11.759
low-altitude bombing training.

00:18:12.519 --> 00:18:13.119
First, we will drop one-hundred-pound bombs

00:18:13.119 --> 00:18:16.200
from an altitude of three hundred feet.

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.039
The key is to hold steady over the target,

00:18:18.359 --> 00:18:20.599
release the bombs, maintain level flight,

00:18:20.599 --> 00:18:22.680
and then get away at top speed

00:18:22.680 --> 00:18:24.559
to avoid the blast shockwave.

00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.880
Once you've mastered this,

00:18:27.559 --> 00:18:29.880
we'll train everyone to drop five-hundred-pound bombs

00:18:30.599 --> 00:18:31.920
from fifteen hundred feet.

00:18:32.279 --> 00:18:33.000
Understood?

00:18:33.559 --> 00:18:34.319
Yes, sir.

00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:35.680
Lieutenant.

00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:36.000
We are conducting short takeoff

00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:37.240
We are conducting short takeoff

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:39.000
and low-altitude bombing training for what reason?

00:18:39.559 --> 00:18:40.200
I, like you,

00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.480
would very much like to know the answer.

00:18:42.119 --> 00:18:44.039
If there are no other questions,

00:18:44.039 --> 00:18:45.400
get ready quickly.

00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:46.720
Move out.

00:18:50.119 --> 00:18:50.759
Lieutenant.

00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:52.200
Boys.

00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:53.519
Cole.

00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.839
Take a trip, fly to Washington.

00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:58.400
Yes, sir.

00:19:00.319 --> 00:19:01.960
Get moving. Let's go.

00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.839
Seven-Seven-Zero-Seven requests takeoff.

00:19:06.839 --> 00:19:09.319
Seven-Seven-Zero-Seven cleared for takeoff.

00:19:09.640 --> 00:19:11.680
Seven-Seven-Zero-Seven rolling onto the runway.

00:19:11.839 --> 00:19:14.039
Seven-Seven-Zero-Seven taking off.

00:19:22.880 --> 00:19:24.319
Lieutenant Colonel, the General is waiting for you.

00:19:24.759 --> 00:19:25.079
Duncan.

00:19:25.079 --> 00:19:26.240
How is the General's mood today?

00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:26.839
Mood?

00:19:27.359 --> 00:19:29.039
I mean, is the General in a good mood today?

00:19:29.559 --> 00:19:30.200
Why?

00:19:30.200 --> 00:19:31.400
You seem to have something on your mind.

00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.200
Do you remember what I

00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:34.359
asked you for help with before?

00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:35.079
I remember.

00:19:36.720 --> 00:19:37.519
I can't help with that.

00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:50.599
Jimmy Doolittle.

00:19:51.559 --> 00:19:52.720
Good to see you, young man.

00:19:53.119 --> 00:19:54.240
How is the training going?

00:19:54.720 --> 00:19:55.400
Very well, General.

00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:56.519
The volunteers

00:19:56.519 --> 00:19:57.960
have already reported to Eglin Field.

00:19:58.240 --> 00:20:00.240
The B-25 bombers are being modified now.

00:20:00.920 --> 00:20:01.559
This is

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.240
all the details.

00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:06.000
It's all written in the report.

00:20:06.240 --> 00:20:08.079
Excellent.

00:20:09.759 --> 00:20:10.720
So,

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:14.279
anything else to add?

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.039
Yes, General.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.720
Currently, I'm only under orders

00:20:19.720 --> 00:20:20.960
to train these pilots.

00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:22.519
But I think you need someone

00:20:22.519 --> 00:20:23.720
to lead this mission.

00:20:24.200 --> 00:20:26.079
I volunteer.

00:20:28.240 --> 00:20:28.920
Jimmy,

00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.160
there's no doubt

00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:32.559
you are the Army's foremost

00:20:32.559 --> 00:20:33.359
flight expert.

00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.480
But there's a lot of work at headquarters

00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:36.240
that needs you.

00:20:37.759 --> 00:20:38.960
If we have to fight,

00:20:40.039 --> 00:20:42.279
we must plan meticulously,

00:20:42.279 --> 00:20:44.119
not just a contest of brute force.

00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:48.599
These young pilots,

00:20:48.599 --> 00:20:49.920
they're all working hard,

00:20:51.079 --> 00:20:52.400
but they need

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:53.480
real combat training.

00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.880
No one is more suitable than you.

00:20:57.880 --> 00:20:58.559
That's true.

00:20:59.319 --> 00:21:01.960
Can we discuss this later?

00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:05.279
General, we don't have time.

00:21:07.359 --> 00:21:08.640
If I lead the team,

00:21:09.359 --> 00:21:11.200
the chances of success

00:21:11.200 --> 00:21:13.000
and of bringing the young men back alive

00:21:13.400 --> 00:21:14.480
will increase significantly.

00:21:17.359 --> 00:21:19.319
That's probably right.

00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.680
But I think you and I both know

00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.200
this mission

00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:25.960
may see very few return alive.

00:21:28.599 --> 00:21:29.599
I'm prepared for the worst,

00:21:29.599 --> 00:21:30.359
General.

00:21:31.079 --> 00:21:32.200
My family is too.

00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:35.720
Alright.

00:21:35.920 --> 00:21:36.799
If

00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.119
Chief of Staff Miff Harmon approves,

00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:44.400
I'll give the green light too.

00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:49.519
Good luck, Jimmy.

00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.039
Thank you, General.

00:21:52.599 --> 00:21:53.839
The stage is right there.

00:21:53.839 --> 00:21:54.960
The band is right there.

00:21:54.960 --> 00:21:56.480
The seat next to me is still empty.

00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:57.960
That's my main point.

00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.400
I am indeed waiting for a lady.

00:22:00.559 --> 00:22:01.119
Duncan.

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:03.119
You have to do me a favor.

00:22:03.119 --> 00:22:03.640
What is it?

00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.240
Find a report

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:06.680
for General Arnold to sign.

00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:07.400
Why?

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:08.720
The General is using a scheme to kill with a borrowed knife,

00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:09.839
planning to have Chief of Staff Miff Harmon

00:22:09.839 --> 00:22:11.279
kick me out.

00:22:11.799 --> 00:22:12.599
Stall him.

00:22:12.599 --> 00:22:13.720
Don't let him make a call.

00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.839
I'll buy you a drink.

00:22:14.839 --> 00:22:15.720
Alright.

00:22:16.279 --> 00:22:16.680
Excuse me.

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.240
Please step aside, sir.

00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:28.599
What's wrong with you? Got a fire under your tail?

00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:29.920
Sir.

00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:32.119
General Arnold has agreed to let me lead the mission.

00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.000
He requested I also get your approval.

00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:35.319
Is that so?

00:22:37.599 --> 00:22:41.160
Then I have no choice but to agree.

00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:43.240
No one is more suitable than you.

00:22:43.759 --> 00:22:44.480
Thank you, Chief of Staff.

00:22:45.599 --> 00:22:48.839
Could you write an order, sir?

00:22:50.279 --> 00:22:50.960
Alright.

00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:54.680
Take this to the War Department.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:55.240
And

00:22:58.559 --> 00:23:00.200
I'll notify them.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:03.759
Harmon speaking.

00:23:05.359 --> 00:23:06.119
No, he's here.

00:23:10.279 --> 00:23:10.799
Really?

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.319
Jimmy said it was your idea,

00:23:14.319 --> 00:23:15.880
so I agreed as well.

00:23:20.519 --> 00:23:22.599
It's too late to withdraw now.

00:23:22.599 --> 00:23:24.079
I've already signed.

00:23:28.519 --> 00:23:29.200
Right.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:37.960
You may go, Lieutenant Colonel.

00:23:50.519 --> 00:23:51.200
Doolittle.

00:23:52.119 --> 00:23:53.119
You owe me a drink.

00:23:53.119 --> 00:23:54.240
Hope you like sake.

00:23:54.319 --> 00:23:55.000
I do.

00:23:57.279 --> 00:23:57.720
General.

00:23:58.359 --> 00:23:59.240
Doolittle.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:03.920
You know I really don't want to lose you,

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:04.480
Jimmy.

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.160
When you go on the mission,

00:24:08.160 --> 00:24:10.279
take care of yourself and those boys.

00:24:10.839 --> 00:24:11.759
I hope you come back in one piece.

00:24:11.759 --> 00:24:13.400
I'll pin the medal on you myself.

00:24:14.279 --> 00:24:14.920
Yes, General.

00:24:15.359 --> 00:24:17.480
Now, about Witt Chen.

00:24:18.119 --> 00:24:19.640
The Chinese are helping search for him.

00:24:20.319 --> 00:24:21.640
We need to do everything we can

00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:22.960
to ensure his safety.

00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:24.720
But you should also know

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.519
I'm sending his replacement.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.960
So you just focus on executing your mission.

00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:30.400
Understood?

00:24:31.200 --> 00:24:31.720
Yes, General.

00:24:36.839 --> 00:24:37.559
Good luck, young man.

00:25:03.759 --> 00:25:04.200
You take control.

00:25:18.119 --> 00:25:19.039
Sir, how was my flying?

00:25:20.039 --> 00:25:20.920
Passable.

00:25:23.079 --> 00:25:24.839
There were some signs of trouble.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.799
The left engine isn't breaking in well.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.599
The compass needs recalibration.

00:25:31.559 --> 00:25:33.200
The fuel gauge is a bit loose.

00:25:34.359 --> 00:25:37.000
There were twelve minor issues on this flight.

00:25:39.480 --> 00:25:40.799
Get them fixed as soon as possible.

00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.000
What's going on?

00:26:11.519 --> 00:26:13.160
The plane's propeller has stopped.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:15.160
You,

00:26:16.039 --> 00:26:16.720
go to the cockpit

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.599
and tell the captain

00:26:17.599 --> 00:26:19.000
one of the propellers has failed.

00:26:19.319 --> 00:26:19.519
Yes, sir.

00:26:24.799 --> 00:26:25.160
Captain

00:26:25.440 --> 00:26:27.160
The left propeller isn't spinning!

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:28.359
Go back to your seat.

00:26:28.759 --> 00:26:30.839
We've notified Shanghai ground control.

00:26:31.079 --> 00:26:32.039
They are preparing fire trucks and ambulances.

00:26:32.039 --> 00:26:32.920
To be ready for anything.

00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:33.640
Is that so?

00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:34.920
Go back and sit down.

00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:37.680
Don't be nervous, it's fine.

00:26:38.599 --> 00:26:39.319
Colonel.

00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.440
We're down to one engine.

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:42.400
Please put this on.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:43.880
Just in case.

00:26:45.519 --> 00:26:46.640
Everyone, stay calm.

00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:48.279
We have prepared parachutes.

00:26:48.279 --> 00:26:49.599
We'll distribute them immediately.

00:26:52.319 --> 00:26:52.960
Put them on quickly.

00:26:54.680 --> 00:26:55.279
Colonel.

00:26:55.319 --> 00:26:56.440
The plane has a major problem.

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:57.160
They have already notified...

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:58.240
...fire trucks and ambulances.

00:26:58.799 --> 00:27:00.920
Colonel, please put it on quickly.

00:27:02.359 --> 00:27:03.039
You put it on first.

00:27:04.039 --> 00:27:05.960
I need the Captain's authorization.

00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:07.359
To allow me into the cockpit.

00:27:07.359 --> 00:27:08.319
To help him land.

00:27:08.319 --> 00:27:08.799
Yes, sir.

00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:16.799
Colonel.

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.319
Colonel.

00:27:21.759 --> 00:27:23.279
One engine has failed.

00:27:23.559 --> 00:27:25.160
Or two pilots this young...

00:27:25.319 --> 00:27:26.480
Which one will make the passengers in the back...

00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:27.440
...panic more?

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:30.039
Have you identified the cause of the failure?

00:27:30.039 --> 00:27:31.160
Reporting, Colonel.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.839
We flew from the mainland to Shanghai.

00:27:32.839 --> 00:27:34.000
We passed through a level four thunderstorm.

00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.039
It likely caused water intake in one engine.

00:27:36.039 --> 00:27:37.400
Causing it to fail.

00:27:38.319 --> 00:27:38.920
Don't be nervous.

00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:41.599
It's a blessing in disguise.

00:27:41.599 --> 00:27:43.240
One engine is still working.

00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:44.480
Now listen to me.

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.319
Adjust to level flight mode.

00:27:46.319 --> 00:27:47.960
Set flaps to ten.

00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:49.440
As long as we maintain balance...

00:27:49.599 --> 00:27:50.599
...we can land safely.

00:27:50.759 --> 00:27:51.279
Yes, sir.

00:28:04.799 --> 00:28:05.799
Captain, bad news.

00:28:05.799 --> 00:28:07.599
The right engine is having trouble too!

00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:09.720
Colonel.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.400
Luck doesn't seem to be on our side.

00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:22.880
Move aside.

00:28:23.279 --> 00:28:24.640
You, take the co-pilot's seat.

00:28:24.759 --> 00:28:25.359
Yes, sir.

00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.000
From now on...

00:28:35.039 --> 00:28:36.240
...you will fully cooperate with me.

00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.359
Yes, sir.

00:28:37.359 --> 00:28:38.240
Now that both our engines...

00:28:38.240 --> 00:28:39.160
...have failed.

00:28:39.920 --> 00:28:41.200
We can only glide down like a glider.

00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:43.000
Until we hit the ground.

00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:44.960
We must get the engines running again.

00:28:46.519 --> 00:28:47.960
We need to dive quickly...

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:49.240
...to increase airspeed.

00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.359
Letting the wind speed drive the engines...

00:28:52.359 --> 00:28:54.279
...to reach minimum rotation speed.

00:28:54.279 --> 00:28:55.640
And make them restart automatically.

00:29:02.279 --> 00:29:03.160
Report altitude.

00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:04.319
Yes, sir.

00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:07.640
Altitude...

00:29:08.039 --> 00:29:08.400
Okay.

00:29:09.119 --> 00:29:10.039
Nine thousand.

00:29:11.039 --> 00:29:12.359
Hold the engine throttle steady.

00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:13.480
Yes, sir.

00:29:22.839 --> 00:29:24.240
Everyone, don't panic!

00:29:24.240 --> 00:29:26.839
Return to your seats!

00:29:27.519 --> 00:29:28.839
Everyone sit down quickly!

00:29:37.559 --> 00:29:38.440
Eight thousand.

00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:40.519
Colonel.

00:29:40.880 --> 00:29:42.599
We are losing altitude critically.

00:29:42.599 --> 00:29:44.160
Prepare ignition system.

00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:45.599
Yes, sir.

00:29:46.279 --> 00:29:48.079
Pull down, prepare to start.

00:29:48.079 --> 00:29:48.960
Yes, sir.

00:29:50.319 --> 00:29:51.240
Seven thousand.

00:29:54.599 --> 00:29:55.640
Six thousand.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:29:59.359
Ignite!

00:30:41.559 --> 00:30:42.799
Resume piloting.

00:30:42.799 --> 00:30:43.400
Yes, sir.

00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:26.559
Good work.

00:32:26.559 --> 00:32:27.599
Please show your ID.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.119
This gentleman's movements must not be recorded.

00:32:39.119 --> 00:32:39.759
Understood?

00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:40.359
Yes, sir.

00:32:40.759 --> 00:32:41.400
Give it back to him.

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.599
It seems the food in Shanghai isn't that great.

00:32:57.799 --> 00:32:58.480
Look at you two...

00:32:58.480 --> 00:32:59.359
...starved and gaunt.

00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:01.240
I really didn't want you to come.

00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:02.319
You think I wanted to come?

00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.160
In the early thirties...

00:33:04.799 --> 00:33:06.920
...at the most famous spy academy in the Far East...

00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.200
...the Shanghai Tongwen Academy.

00:33:09.599 --> 00:33:11.559
There were four ambitious young men.

00:33:11.720 --> 00:33:13.160
Right on this street...

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.920
...leading students in a parade.

00:33:15.799 --> 00:33:17.680
Who were these three fools?

00:33:19.559 --> 00:33:20.160
Takeki Ichiro.

00:33:21.279 --> 00:33:21.880
Akanishi.

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:23.759
And me, the third fool.

00:33:23.759 --> 00:33:24.559
Takizawa.

00:33:26.039 --> 00:33:27.359
Wasn't there one more person?

00:33:28.279 --> 00:33:29.240
Who would have thought...

00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:31.279
...our principal, Konoe Fumimaro...

00:33:31.279 --> 00:33:33.039
...would become the Prime Minister of Japan.

00:33:33.440 --> 00:33:34.319
Stop reminiscing.

00:33:34.319 --> 00:33:35.279
Are we that old now?

00:33:37.240 --> 00:33:37.759
Wait.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:39.920
I have a surprise for you.

00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:55.039
Teacher.

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:04.599
Teacher.

00:34:05.279 --> 00:34:07.000
I haven't met the people from Chongqing yet.

00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:09.599
So regarding the specifics of this operation...

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:10.400
...I'm not clear yet.

00:34:11.079 --> 00:34:12.159
But it seems very mysterious.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.280
They only told me the mission location.

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:14.920
On Sanzao Island.

00:34:15.199 --> 00:34:16.559
And told me to find a way to get there.

00:34:19.039 --> 00:34:20.400
We have a rough idea...

00:34:20.559 --> 00:34:22.440
...why they recalled you this time.

00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:27.159
An American plane...

00:34:27.679 --> 00:34:29.719
...over Sanzao Island in Zhongshan County...

00:34:29.719 --> 00:34:30.480
...was shot down.

00:34:31.400 --> 00:34:33.280
There was a US Major on board.

00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:35.599
He parachuted onto Sanzao Island.

00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:37.280
Currently...

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:39.599
...there is no news of his capture.

00:34:41.039 --> 00:34:42.400
They woke you up this time...

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.960
...to get you to extract this man.

00:34:45.559 --> 00:34:47.719
Or silence him.

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.559
Waking up a high-level strategic intelligence agent...

00:34:56.119 --> 00:34:57.360
...just to complete a rescue mission?

00:34:57.880 --> 00:34:59.360
Isn't that using an anti-aircraft gun to shoot a mosquito?

00:35:00.559 --> 00:35:01.639
Not really.

00:35:02.840 --> 00:35:04.079
We don't know yet...

00:35:04.079 --> 00:35:06.159
...what specific secrets this man holds.

00:35:07.039 --> 00:35:09.079
But according to the intelligence we've received...

00:35:09.719 --> 00:35:11.599
...those currently paying close attention to this...

00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:13.320
is the United States

00:35:13.639 --> 00:35:14.599
and the Nationalist Government's

00:35:14.599 --> 00:35:16.760
highest-level core figures.

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:20.199
The highest level.

00:35:20.559 --> 00:35:22.000
Could it be Roosevelt and Chiang Kai-shek?

00:35:22.559 --> 00:35:23.199
It is them.

00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:27.039
The Bureau of Military Statistics requires us

00:35:27.599 --> 00:35:29.119
to select someone for you

00:35:30.199 --> 00:35:31.320
to assist in your operation.

00:35:31.639 --> 00:35:32.719
Her name is Ye Biying.

00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:35.000
She is not a Bureau of Military Statistics agent.

00:35:36.079 --> 00:35:38.079
She is a trainee doctor

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.320
in the medical team of our Eighth Route Army office.

00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:42.679
She is a local of Sanzao Island.

00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.159
The Bureau needs someone

00:35:44.159 --> 00:35:46.559
with local social connections to assist you,

00:35:46.920 --> 00:35:47.800
so they chose her.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:49.760
Understood.

00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:53.920
The real difficulty is

00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.199
the Bureau may order you

00:35:56.880 --> 00:35:58.559
after completing the mission

00:35:58.639 --> 00:36:00.039
to eliminate this assistant.

00:36:00.360 --> 00:36:00.800
Not eliminating her

00:36:00.800 --> 00:36:02.239
wouldn't be the Bureau's style.

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:07.239
But Comrade Lao Pan asked me to tell you:

00:36:08.320 --> 00:36:09.800
Use all your strength

00:36:10.320 --> 00:36:11.360
to protect this assistant.

00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:13.639
Get her out safely,

00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:15.719
and bring her back intact.

00:36:17.079 --> 00:36:18.360
And if we encounter difficulties?

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:21.119
Overcome them.

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:23.840
Understood.

00:36:32.159 --> 00:36:34.599
Now we are in enemy-occupied territory.

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:37.199
The Japanese and Wang Jingwei's puppets have

00:36:37.199 --> 00:36:38.079
informants along the route.

00:36:38.599 --> 00:36:40.639
Be extremely vigilant when speaking.

00:36:40.719 --> 00:36:42.599
Pay attention to your surroundings.

00:36:42.719 --> 00:36:44.039
If we encounter an inspection later,

00:36:44.039 --> 00:36:45.039
don't you speak.

00:36:45.039 --> 00:36:46.599
I'll handle everything.

00:36:55.039 --> 00:36:56.039
Thank you.

00:36:57.199 --> 00:36:57.920
Captain Liu!

00:36:58.599 --> 00:36:59.440
Boss Shen!

00:36:59.440 --> 00:37:00.280
What a coincidence!

00:37:00.840 --> 00:37:01.360
Too much of a coincidence!

00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.000
What's in the bag?

00:37:02.239 --> 00:37:03.480
I brought my family member here.

00:37:03.599 --> 00:37:04.079
Just arrived in Shanghai.

00:37:04.079 --> 00:37:04.880
Of course there are things.

00:37:04.920 --> 00:37:05.639
Open it and let us see.

00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.480
Why should I show you my things?

00:37:09.599 --> 00:37:10.320
Open it and let us see.

00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:13.320
So fierce.

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:14.880
If you want to see, I'll show you.

00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:16.440
Xiao Ye.

00:37:17.079 --> 00:37:18.039
Uh...

00:37:18.039 --> 00:37:19.199
Let me introduce you.

00:37:19.360 --> 00:37:21.159
This is my Shanghai friend, Captain Liu.

00:37:21.239 --> 00:37:21.960
This is my friend.

00:37:22.599 --> 00:37:23.119
Hello.

00:37:23.639 --> 00:37:24.960
This officer is conducting an inspection.

00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.000
Come on, come on, inspect first.

00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:26.679
Here, look.

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:27.159
Not necessary.

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:27.559
Take a look.

00:37:27.559 --> 00:37:28.280
What are you doing?!

00:37:30.079 --> 00:37:31.000
My brothers don't know any better.

00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:31.719
My apologies.

00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:32.440
It's fine.

00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.320
Just doing our job.

00:37:33.719 --> 00:37:35.079
Does that still need checking?

00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:35.719
No need.

00:37:36.039 --> 00:37:36.440
Alright then.

00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:37.719
We're in a hurry.

00:37:37.840 --> 00:37:38.079
Alright!

00:37:38.079 --> 00:37:38.679
Let's catch up another time.

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:39.159
Boss Shen.

00:37:39.719 --> 00:37:40.159
After you.

00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:41.119
Okay, goodbye!

00:37:43.639 --> 00:37:45.079
Open your eyes wider next time!

00:37:45.079 --> 00:37:46.079
Didn't I tell you?

00:37:46.079 --> 00:37:47.039
Don't speak carelessly.

00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.079
You even told him to check.

00:37:50.079 --> 00:37:51.159
What if he discovered me...

00:37:53.679 --> 00:37:54.920
Where's the gift I gave you?

00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:57.760
Didn't you say

00:37:58.679 --> 00:38:00.159
they were all hidden

00:38:00.559 --> 00:38:01.599
there?

00:38:04.079 --> 00:38:05.320
You little trickster.

00:38:07.679 --> 00:38:09.679
You're the one who said to put it there.

00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:26.599
Where are we going now?

00:38:27.239 --> 00:38:28.599
To the hospital where you'll work.

00:38:30.199 --> 00:38:31.440
Ruihua Hospital.

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.360
One of our secret contact points.

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:11.840
Come on, make way, make way.

00:39:14.519 --> 00:39:15.440
Make way.

00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:18.480
Thank you for your hard work.

00:39:19.400 --> 00:39:20.000
You're here.

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.599
Director, we've been waiting for you.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:23.559
And this is?

00:39:23.760 --> 00:39:25.119
This is the one I told you about,

00:39:25.119 --> 00:39:25.880
Comrade Xiao Ye.

00:39:26.440 --> 00:39:27.199
Hello, hello. This is the hospital director.

00:39:27.760 --> 00:39:28.480
Let's go inside.

00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.159
Brief her on the hospital situation.

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:31.800
Good. Please, inside.

00:39:33.159 --> 00:39:34.480
Anti-Japanese elements have been found in the hospital!

00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:35.440
Nobody move!

00:39:36.199 --> 00:39:37.400
Submit to inspection!

00:39:48.679 --> 00:39:50.000
Submit to inspection!

00:39:54.119 --> 00:39:54.559
Your Honor.

00:39:55.639 --> 00:39:56.760
I'm here to see a doctor.

00:39:57.400 --> 00:39:58.039
See a doctor?

00:39:59.559 --> 00:40:01.000
Patients line up over there.

00:40:01.320 --> 00:40:01.760
Okay, okay.

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:05.760
Go line up over there quickly.

00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:07.559
Hurry up!

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:09.000
Everyone stand properly! Stand properly!

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.920
No fussing! No fussing! No fussing!

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:13.800
Everyone stand properly! Stand properly!

00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:14.840
Men stand here.

00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:16.199
Women stand here, alright?

00:40:17.559 --> 00:40:17.960
Your Honor.

00:40:19.039 --> 00:40:19.760
Begin.

00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:20.559
Yes.

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.800
Everyone listen carefully!

00:40:25.199 --> 00:40:25.800
Now,

00:40:26.239 --> 00:40:28.639
we will verify the identity

00:40:28.639 --> 00:40:29.599
of every one of you.

00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.239
If there are no issues,

00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.239
you can all go home.

00:40:34.559 --> 00:40:35.039
Your Honor.

00:40:35.360 --> 00:40:36.039
We're ready.

00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:38.679
Who is the director?

00:40:39.559 --> 00:40:40.480
Who is the director?!

00:40:41.199 --> 00:40:41.719
It's me.

00:40:42.199 --> 00:40:42.920
Come here quickly!

00:40:42.920 --> 00:40:43.920
Quick, quick, quick!

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.480
I am Liu Yiqian,

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:47.559
director of this hospital.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.760
My home address is 17 Anxi Road.

00:40:52.639 --> 00:40:53.039
Your Honor.

00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:56.360
He is our hospital director, Liu Yiqian.

00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:58.199
The doctors and nurses here...

00:40:58.199 --> 00:40:59.119
you know them all?

00:40:59.679 --> 00:41:01.400
You know all the doctors and nurses here, right?

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:02.679
I know them all.

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.039
I know them all.

00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.239
Begin.

00:41:13.679 --> 00:41:14.119
Yes.

00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:21.320
You are a doctor.

00:41:23.599 --> 00:41:24.400
Are you a doctor?

00:41:25.639 --> 00:41:26.320
Yes.

00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:27.079
Yes.

00:41:27.079 --> 00:41:27.960
What is her name?

00:41:28.559 --> 00:41:29.559
What's the name?

00:41:30.199 --> 00:41:31.000
Liu Yuhan.

00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:32.280
Liu Yuhan.

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:35.800
What is her name?

00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:37.880
Yes, Taijun.

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:52.119
Don't you run!

00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:56.920
Don't move. Stand still.

00:41:57.119 --> 00:41:58.159
Everyone, move over there. Move over.

00:41:58.159 --> 00:41:59.000
Stand properly.

00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:00.280
Quick, move over there. Move over.

00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.119
What do you do?

00:42:04.559 --> 00:42:05.639
What's your business?

00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.840
Taijun is asking what you do.

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.079
What is your occupation?

00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:19.800
Are you a doctor,

00:42:23.039 --> 00:42:24.239
or a patient?

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.079
Are you a doctor or a patient?

00:42:28.239 --> 00:42:29.360
I'm talking to you.
