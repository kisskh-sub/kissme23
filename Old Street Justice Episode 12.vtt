WEBVTT

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:57.439
Everyone, stop!

00:01:00.759 --> 00:01:01.560
Er Ni

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:08.760
Are you all deaf?

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:10.760
You won't even listen to me?

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:12.599
Lang Shu

00:01:19.439 --> 00:01:20.319
Brother Shengzi

00:01:20.719 --> 00:01:22.319
Please save my brother!

00:01:23.879 --> 00:01:24.680
Painted Face

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.280
What happened to you?

00:01:28.159 --> 00:01:28.799
Who did this?

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:29.319
Brother (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:30.959 --> 00:01:31.840
I'm fine.

00:01:34.319 --> 00:01:36.319
Crow kidnapped me and took me to Ghost Face Hall.

00:01:36.920 --> 00:01:38.280
My brother only did all this to save me.

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.560
That's why he joined them.

00:01:39.719 --> 00:01:41.920
Ever since we got back from the fishing boat,

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.760
they've been beating my brother with sticks every day.

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:46.840
He's like this because of me.

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:48.280
If it weren't for me,

00:01:48.319 --> 00:01:50.000
my brother wouldn't be in this state.

00:01:52.879 --> 00:01:53.719
Don't say that.

00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:55.319
I'm your brother, after all.

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:02.519
Your Ghost Face Hall beats up my brother,

00:02:02.519 --> 00:02:03.439
kidnaps my friend.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:05.719
If there's no proper explanation for today,

00:02:05.959 --> 00:02:07.799
Ghost Face Hall won't need to exist anymore.

00:02:09.719 --> 00:02:11.120
Who do you think you're fooling?

00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.479
With just you few good-for-nothings?

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.080
Let's see if today

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.520
I can let you leave here standing up.

00:02:16.919 --> 00:02:18.360
Is it your turn to speak?

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.520
Who kidnapped this girl?

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:23.400
Step out and apologize to Mr. Zhao.

00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.159
This matter...

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.240
It wasn't me!

00:02:27.879 --> 00:02:28.800
It was all them!

00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:30.840
My hand!

00:02:38.439 --> 00:02:40.120
You should be glad Xiao Qian is okay.

00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:41.599
Otherwise,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.879
it wouldn't be just one finger.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.199
Drag him away.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.360
Mr. Zhao.

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:55.919
Regarding this girl,

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:57.400
we were in the wrong.

00:02:57.479 --> 00:02:59.120
I'll send trusted men right now

00:02:59.120 --> 00:03:00.400
to take her to the hospital for a check-up.

00:03:00.919 --> 00:03:02.719
Then, safe and sound,

00:03:02.759 --> 00:03:05.039
return her exactly where she was taken from.

00:03:05.039 --> 00:03:06.840
Are you satisfied with that?

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:12.719
Satisfied.

00:03:20.639 --> 00:03:22.960
Then what about my brother's injuries?

00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.159
How do we settle that?

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.639
As the Enforcer of Ghost Face Hall,

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.719
Painted Face broke the rules, so he must be punished.

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:33.680
In this matter,

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.719
even Uncle Gui Lang

00:03:37.319 --> 00:03:38.919
can't find fault, right?

00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:41.759
Jin Fu.

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:42.680
Step back.

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:45.840
You kidnap a sister

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.599
to threaten her brother's life.

00:03:48.439 --> 00:03:49.639
You call that "rules"?

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:51.560
Zhao Fengsheng.

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:54.719
This is Bian Shui.

00:03:55.639 --> 00:03:57.960
Whoever has the biggest fist makes the rules.

00:03:58.439 --> 00:03:59.240
So what?

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:00.360
Not convinced?

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.639
Let's compare then.

00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.319
Then let's compare.

00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.199
Come on.

00:04:05.159 --> 00:04:05.840
Shengzi.

00:04:11.759 --> 00:04:12.560
Painted Face.

00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.639
I'll use your butterfly knife to get revenge for you.

00:04:15.919 --> 00:04:16.720
Brother.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:17.920
Let me go.

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.560
Am I still your brother or not?

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.720
Kid.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.920
I don't know why Lang Shu

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:29.000
shows you so much respect.

00:04:29.399 --> 00:04:31.040
But today, none of you

00:04:31.759 --> 00:04:33.040
are getting out of here.

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:38.360
You blind fool!

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:45.839
My eyes!

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.560
Uncle Gui Lang!

00:04:47.959 --> 00:04:49.279
Why did you betray me?

00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:53.879
Someone!

00:04:53.879 --> 00:04:54.639
Take him away.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.319
I've followed you for so many years!

00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.240
Why?!

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.600
Brother Zhao, any other instructions?

00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:06.480
Let's end things here today.

00:05:08.680 --> 00:05:11.160
As long as your Ghost Face Hall stops troubling Old Street,

00:05:11.759 --> 00:05:12.920
I won't take action again.

00:05:13.639 --> 00:05:17.319
This old wolf head can guarantee that.

00:05:26.079 --> 00:05:28.279
Who would dare move against this big Buddha?

00:05:28.959 --> 00:05:29.759
Jin Fu.

00:05:30.519 --> 00:05:32.279
I was saving your life.

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:34.680
Second Master.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:35.439
It's me.

00:05:36.639 --> 00:05:38.879
Lang Shu, the matter is settled.

00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.519
I can't handle this matter.

00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.040
Perhaps you should find someone more capable.

00:05:44.800 --> 00:05:45.600
What?

00:05:46.279 --> 00:05:47.920
How could a small Old Street

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:49.959
make an underground emperor like you

00:05:49.959 --> 00:05:50.920
so hesitant?

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:52.800
To be honest with you,

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:56.360
the leader of Old Street is Zhao Fengsheng.

00:05:56.759 --> 00:05:58.040
He's from Yun Ting.

00:05:58.399 --> 00:06:00.360
And he has Li Xiangping backing him.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:03.639
My Ghost Face Hall can't afford to provoke them.

00:06:04.639 --> 00:06:05.639
Zhao Fengsheng?

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.120
He's from Yun Ting?

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:09.199
Second Master, you know him?

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:10.480
Lang Shu.

00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:13.000
I'll find a way to hold off Li Xiangping.

00:06:13.399 --> 00:06:15.240
As long as you help me take Old Street,

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:17.199
from now on in Bian Shui,

00:06:17.839 --> 00:06:20.920
we won't have to answer to anyone.

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:23.839
Second Master, I'm old.

00:06:24.279 --> 00:06:26.879
And with Zhao Fengsheng here in Bian Shui,

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:29.160
the times have already changed.

00:06:42.759 --> 00:06:43.560
Bro

00:06:44.879 --> 00:06:46.040
I've caused you trouble.

00:06:46.279 --> 00:06:47.120
I'm your brother.

00:06:47.439 --> 00:06:48.639
If I don't help you, who will?

00:06:49.319 --> 00:06:50.120
This...

00:06:50.319 --> 00:06:51.120
...he's leaving?

00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.680
What trick did you use,

00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:55.279
to tame that Ghost Wolf?

00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:57.839
To dare charge into Ghost Face Hall alone,

00:06:57.839 --> 00:06:59.199
you're the first in Bian Shui.

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:01.639
Uncle Gui Lang owed a friend of mine a favor.

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.319
Didn't expect to use it today.

00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:05.360
You have friends besides us?

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.040
Why haven't you introduced us?

00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:11.279
It's a woman.

00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:17.000
Probably some vixen.

00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:17.959
I don't even want to know.

00:07:18.439 --> 00:07:19.199
Don't talk nonsense.

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:20.959
They're all sworn brothers.

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.439
Who knows what's true

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:23.920
and what's false from your mouth?

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:27.839
What's wrong?

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:29.240
I can't walk.

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:31.319
You're tired already?

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:32.680
I wonder who it was

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:34.600
who, the moment she heard Shengzi was in trouble,

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.959
flew out of that bridal shop

00:07:35.959 --> 00:07:37.079
like she had wings.

00:07:40.959 --> 00:07:41.759
Er Ni.

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.360
You look beautiful today.

00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:44.560
Why are you dressed like this?

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.800
You're not really marrying that pretty boy, are you?

00:07:47.879 --> 00:07:48.519
Who?

00:07:48.519 --> 00:07:49.560
How could I?

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:50.839
Tianyu was just messing around.

00:07:51.639 --> 00:07:52.800
Who I like...

00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:55.279
...even a blind man could see.

00:08:00.959 --> 00:08:02.639
Who could possibly marry our Er Ni?

00:08:02.639 --> 00:08:04.279
He'd have to be an exceptional man.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.519
Zhao Fengsheng!

00:08:07.199 --> 00:08:08.600
You think I'm desperate to marry you?

00:08:09.079 --> 00:08:10.680
I've got the looks,

00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:11.800
I've got the figure.

00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:12.959
What man couldn't I find?

00:08:19.439 --> 00:08:20.240
Zhao Fengsheng!

00:08:20.639 --> 00:08:21.439
Put me down!

00:08:21.519 --> 00:08:22.560
Your feet hurt, right?

00:08:22.759 --> 00:08:23.560
I'll carry you.

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:24.879
I don't want you to carry me!

00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:26.360
Put me down! Stop hitting!

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.040
That's too much!

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:27.879
Put me down!

00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:30.079
What are you doing?

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.480
Zhao Fengsheng!

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.240
You're doing this on purpose!

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.320
It's fine. You're heavy, but I can manage.

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:39.480
The Four Pests of Old Street

00:08:39.759 --> 00:08:40.879
are finally all together today.

00:08:40.879 --> 00:08:41.320
All together.

00:08:41.799 --> 00:08:42.720
Let go of me!

00:08:42.720 --> 00:08:43.279
Stop hitting!

00:08:45.399 --> 00:08:47.759
Zhao Fengsheng, you're finished, I'm telling you!

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:51.600
I'll beat you to death!

00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:56.960
Wheee!

00:08:58.240 --> 00:08:59.519
Zhao Fengsheng!

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:01.879
I'll hit you!

00:09:10.559 --> 00:09:11.360
Let's go.

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.120
Let's check it out.

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.559
Check it out, check it out.

00:09:20.399 --> 00:09:21.320
Uncle Gui Lang's men

00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:22.799
are all gone.

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:23.759
Come on, come on.

00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:26.399
Let's go, let's go.

00:09:27.799 --> 00:09:28.799
Zhao Fengsheng

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.639
really went to Ghost Face Hall?

00:09:31.919 --> 00:09:33.159
He was just bluffing.

00:09:33.480 --> 00:09:34.320
Actually,

00:09:34.679 --> 00:09:36.480
he went to kneel and kowtow.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:37.120
Yu Chen,

00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:38.200
how would you know that?

00:09:38.559 --> 00:09:40.600
My men already called and told me.

00:09:41.200 --> 00:09:42.360
Zhao Fengsheng and his crew

00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:43.679
were kicked out of the hall.

00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:45.759
If they didn't kneel and act like dogs,

00:09:45.759 --> 00:09:46.639
what else could they do?

00:09:47.559 --> 00:09:48.840
Then let them fight each other.

00:09:48.919 --> 00:09:50.840
As long as it doesn't affect our Old Street.

00:09:51.399 --> 00:09:52.559
We mustn't think that way.

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.720
If Zhao Fengsheng becomes Uncle Gui Lang's man,

00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:56.080
and comes back to our Old Street,

00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.600
he'll definitely have an agenda.

00:09:57.799 --> 00:09:58.600
Then what do we do?

00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:00.000
Yu Chen,

00:10:00.159 --> 00:10:00.879
and Er Ni...

00:10:00.879 --> 00:10:02.799
...has also been deceived by Zhao Fengsheng.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:04.240
I'll go back and talk some sense into her.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:05.120
Auntie,

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.320
don't you worry.

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.919
I'll definitely help Ya Qing

00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:10.840
see Zhao Fengsheng for the loser he is.

00:10:11.279 --> 00:10:12.639
Good, that's good.

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.679
Yu Chen, you really are the son-in-law I picked.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.399
Manager Bai.

00:10:17.799 --> 00:10:19.080
You said Er Ni ran off?

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:19.960
Where did she go?

00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:20.799
Miss Qian,

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:21.840
it's all because of that Zhao Fengsheng.

00:10:21.840 --> 00:10:23.159
Who's bad-mouthing me again?

00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.039
They're all out to welcome us.

00:10:30.519 --> 00:10:31.519
What a reception.

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:32.840
Neighbors.

00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:33.679
It's over.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:34.759
Everything's been settled.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.120
Uncle Gui Lang from now on

00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:37.960
won't send anyone to bother the neighbors anymore.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:40.759
What's going on?

00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.200
Look, there's even blood.

00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:43.120
Get down from there!

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.279
Mom.

00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:46.960
Stay away from that lunatic.

00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:48.639
Er Ni.

00:10:49.159 --> 00:10:50.559
How did you get so hurt?

00:10:50.799 --> 00:10:51.519
Who did this to you?

00:10:51.519 --> 00:10:52.639
Darn it, I'll get revenge for you.

00:10:52.679 --> 00:10:53.360
It's nothing.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.200
Just minor injuries.

00:10:54.480 --> 00:10:55.279
Er Ni...

00:10:55.279 --> 00:10:56.080
These injuries of yours...

00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:57.600
were from Uncle Gui Lang, right?

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.240
Some people...

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.039
should just cause less trouble.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.240
Neighbors!

00:11:04.440 --> 00:11:05.759
What's wrong with you all?

00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:07.840
Shengzi drove Uncle Gui Lang's men away.

00:11:07.840 --> 00:11:09.240
Forget about throwing a feast to celebrate,

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.919
why are you being so disgusting here?

00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.080
Uncle Gui Lang was brought here by him.

00:11:13.159 --> 00:11:14.399
Besides, he even wanted to kneel

00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:15.519
and be a dog for Uncle Gui Lang.

00:11:15.679 --> 00:11:17.720
Why should we thank him?

00:11:17.759 --> 00:11:18.559
Who?

00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.440
Who wanted to be a dog for Uncle Gui Lang?

00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.879
Bai, you jerk.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.320
It's you again, stirring up trouble, huh?

00:11:25.320 --> 00:11:27.159
Why did you go and raid that gang's den?

00:11:27.159 --> 00:11:29.679
Look at the state you're in now!

00:11:29.879 --> 00:11:30.559
Exactly!

00:11:30.559 --> 00:11:31.320
Yaqing.

00:11:31.320 --> 00:11:33.279
You're about to marry Manager Bai.

00:11:33.279 --> 00:11:35.200
It's better to stay away from this kind of person from now on.

00:11:35.679 --> 00:11:37.000
If you hadn't mentioned it, I'd have forgotten.

00:11:37.159 --> 00:11:38.320
This is going too far.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.360
Did you ask for my opinion?

00:11:39.679 --> 00:11:40.440
Yaqing.

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:40.879
I...

00:11:40.879 --> 00:11:41.639
But Yaqing...

00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:43.559
we got engaged today.

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:45.159
How can you be so shameless?

00:11:45.159 --> 00:11:45.960
If you're so eager to get married,

00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:46.720
go marry my mom.

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.039
You jerk!

00:11:48.279 --> 00:11:49.360
Are you trying to kill me?

00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:50.759
You're making fun of your own mother?

00:11:51.799 --> 00:11:53.919
We've already accepted Yu Chen's betrothal gift.

00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:54.919
In three days,

00:11:55.559 --> 00:11:56.600
we're holding the wedding.

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.480
Let's just get the wedding over with.

00:11:58.759 --> 00:11:59.279
Yeah.

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:00.639
You two go ahead and get married then.

00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:03.519
Yaqing.

00:12:07.919 --> 00:12:08.639
Auntie Liu.

00:12:09.159 --> 00:12:10.519
Er Ni is almost thirty.

00:12:10.519 --> 00:12:12.120
You should respect her opinion.

00:12:12.919 --> 00:12:13.720
You useless fool!

00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:14.519
You shut your mouth!

00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:16.279
Why is Yaqing almost thirty and still unmarried?

00:12:16.279 --> 00:12:17.320
It's all because of you!

00:12:17.919 --> 00:12:19.639
We're really unlucky,

00:12:19.639 --> 00:12:21.320
how did we get stuck with you?

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.960
If you don't want to live, fine,

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.519
but look at the injuries you've caused Yaqing.

00:12:24.519 --> 00:12:25.639
Are you even a man?

00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:27.919
I used to think you could fight a bit.

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:31.600
If you were willing to better yourself,

00:12:31.679 --> 00:12:33.279
you could've been a bodyguard or something.

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:34.559
But now it seems

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.320
you can't even protect Er Ni.

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.600
You're completely useless.

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.360
What?

00:12:38.559 --> 00:12:40.320
You still want to use my relationship with Er Ni

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.320
to swindle my father?

00:12:41.320 --> 00:12:42.039
Ugh!

00:12:42.759 --> 00:12:43.600
Shameless!

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.480
If you don't know the truth,

00:12:46.879 --> 00:12:48.080
then don't talk nonsense.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:50.080
Watch your words bring you trouble.

00:12:51.399 --> 00:12:53.120
Now you're threatening me?

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:54.840
Let me tell you, Zhao Fengsheng,

00:12:56.279 --> 00:12:58.679
with your habit of being a homewrecker,

00:12:58.799 --> 00:12:59.600
I don't believe

00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.840
you can do anything to me.

00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:01.360
I...

00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:03.360
Listen up.

00:13:03.519 --> 00:13:05.720
I'm staying at Er Ni's place these days.

00:13:05.879 --> 00:13:07.159
If you dare show up,

00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.399
I'll have someone cripple you.

00:13:10.399 --> 00:13:10.919
Pah!

00:13:18.840 --> 00:13:20.960
How can this woman talk so much?

00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:24.159
Zhao Fengsheng!

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:25.799
Look at what you've done!

00:13:26.679 --> 00:13:27.919
Ruining an engagement,

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.480
corrupting morals!

00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:30.279
Disgusting!

00:13:30.519 --> 00:13:31.240
Brother Gangzi!

00:13:34.279 --> 00:13:35.080
Xiaoxiao is awake!

00:13:39.519 --> 00:13:40.320
Neighbors!

00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:43.080
You've all watched Er Ni grow up.

00:13:43.159 --> 00:13:44.440
Do you really want

00:13:44.559 --> 00:13:47.039
her to marry a man full of lies?

00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.080
Still pretending, are you?

00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:49.799
You're talking about yourself.

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.759
Yu Chen saved Xiaoxiao from you.

00:13:52.759 --> 00:13:53.960
Who's good and who's bad,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.279
we see as clear as day.

00:13:56.279 --> 00:13:57.320
Yeah!

00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:58.120
Zhao Fengsheng,

00:13:58.399 --> 00:14:00.440
someone who gains fame by slandering others

00:14:00.519 --> 00:14:02.039
will never amount to anything.

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.799
A person like you, who ruins relationships

00:14:04.879 --> 00:14:06.840
and traffics children,

00:14:07.159 --> 00:14:08.639
who could ever trust you?

00:14:09.159 --> 00:14:09.679
Is that so?

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.679
Then today, let everyone see

00:14:11.799 --> 00:14:12.960
your true face.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.440
Let me share some good news.

00:14:15.559 --> 00:14:17.039
Xiaoxiao is awake.
