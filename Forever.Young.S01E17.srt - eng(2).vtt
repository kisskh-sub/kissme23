WEBVTT

00:01:55.359 --> 00:01:57.159
Director Dong, he's still waiting.

00:01:57.519 --> 00:01:58.799
Then let him wait.

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.040
Okay, understood.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.840
Jing'er.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.560
Coming.

00:02:16.879 --> 00:02:17.879
It's a delivery.

00:02:20.439 --> 00:02:21.240
Uncle Tong.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:21.879
Tongtong.

00:02:22.039 --> 00:02:22.680
Auntie.

00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:24.400
Quick, you haven't been to our new place yet.

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:25.199
You startled me.

00:02:25.199 --> 00:02:26.400
Quick, quick, come in, come in.

00:02:26.479 --> 00:02:27.039
Uncle Tong.

00:02:27.039 --> 00:02:28.120
Your new home is really nice.

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:28.759
Bought some fruit.

00:02:28.759 --> 00:02:29.319
Thank you, thank you.

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.520
Come here, give me a hug.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:31.919
A hug, a hug.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:32.759
You're too polite.

00:02:32.759 --> 00:02:33.240
Uncle Wang.

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.960
Hurry, hurry.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.159
Make tea, hurry and make tea.

00:02:35.159 --> 00:02:35.879
Sit, sit.

00:02:35.879 --> 00:02:37.000
You sit, you sit.

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.840
Please sit further in.

00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.919
Alright, then I'll sit here.

00:02:39.479 --> 00:02:41.479
You rascal, you.

00:02:41.599 --> 00:02:43.080
Since you moved,

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.560
how long has it been

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.280
without coming by the shop?

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.960
What are you doing at home?

00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:51.719
I'm just, you know, keeping busy.

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:55.360
As for me, I don't visit without a reason.

00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.560
Uncle came this time to say

00:03:00.599 --> 00:03:02.199
that my script

00:03:02.439 --> 00:03:03.960
has reached

00:03:04.159 --> 00:03:06.400
the part where Peng Le Xuan opens.

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:07.759
So now,

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:10.080
it involves the roast duck technique.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.319
How should I write it in the script?

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:14.000
No.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.439
Well, Uncle Tong,

00:03:15.759 --> 00:03:17.400
right now, I...

00:03:18.039 --> 00:03:20.080
I can't even mention

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.360
those two words.

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.080
It makes me nauseous.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.159
Here we go again.

00:03:25.159 --> 00:03:26.400
I know you

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:28.120
get sick at the smell.

00:03:28.120 --> 00:03:28.680
Yes.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.080
But this craft,

00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.759
you can't have forgotten it all, right?

00:03:31.879 --> 00:03:32.879
Right?

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.159
Come on, come on, tell Uncle.

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:36.879
I don't even dare think about it.

00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:37.719
Tell me.

00:03:37.879 --> 00:03:38.759
I know.

00:03:38.759 --> 00:03:39.520
Come on, tell me.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.360
Uncle Wang.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.520
This plaque.

00:03:41.639 --> 00:03:43.120
Looking at it up close like this

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:44.120
is a completely different feeling

00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:45.800
than seeing it hanging overhead.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.439
Here, let me show you.

00:03:50.599 --> 00:03:53.280
This is a real antique.

00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:59.520
On the first day Peng Le Xuan opened

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.120
in Baofang Hutong,

00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.120
this was the plaque they hung.

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.159
Right, Big Brother?

00:04:04.199 --> 00:04:04.840
Yes.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:05.879
Here.

00:04:05.879 --> 00:04:06.879
Girl, sit here.

00:04:07.039 --> 00:04:08.159
Listen to me.

00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:12.360
This plaque has been through a lot.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.560
Times were very hard back then.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.240
Always lacking this and that.

00:04:16.399 --> 00:04:20.680
It was almost burned as firewood.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:22.680
His grandfather used to talk about this.

00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.079
Not his grandfather.

00:04:24.079 --> 00:04:25.800
It was his great-grandfather.

00:04:28.959 --> 00:04:30.680
Here, Uncle Tong, have some tea.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:31.600
Thank you, thank you.

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.360
Thank you, Auntie.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.160
Speaking of his great-grandfather,

00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:37.959
he was incredibly clever.

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.519
He thought it over

00:04:40.519 --> 00:04:44.040
and that very night called his grandfather.

00:04:44.279 --> 00:04:45.879
The two of them, in the dead of night

00:04:45.879 --> 00:04:47.439
when it was quiet and no one was around,

00:04:47.439 --> 00:04:51.360
went to the kitchen where the firewood was piled.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.839
They stole this plaque out,

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:55.439
carried it together,

00:04:55.439 --> 00:04:57.879
all the way to their own home,

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:00.319
went up to the roof,

00:05:00.319 --> 00:05:02.560
and tied it to a roof beam.

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:04.439
Roof beams are sturdy, right?

00:05:04.439 --> 00:05:07.560
Later, they sealed the ceiling with paper.

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.120
How safe!

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:11.279
It stayed sealed for twenty years.

00:05:11.439 --> 00:05:15.040
Until the early eighties,

00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:17.800
did it see the light of day again.

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:21.439
The older generation really had it tough.

00:05:21.439 --> 00:05:23.040
Of course it wasn't easy.

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:24.560
Therefore,

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:27.319
we must not let down the Ma family's

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.000
generations of hard work and effort.

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:31.879
Understand?

00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:32.560
Here.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:34.000
No, no, it's not that...

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:34.839
Um, Uncle Tong,

00:05:34.839 --> 00:05:35.439
um, um...

00:05:35.439 --> 00:05:37.439
Right when you were coming in,

00:05:37.439 --> 00:05:38.920
I was just about to go out.

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:40.040
I, I have an appointment.

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:42.040
If I don't go now,

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.720
it'll be a bit rude.

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:44.360
No, no.

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.879
Let's talk.

00:05:44.879 --> 00:05:45.720
Hey, Jing'er.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.000
You, you entertain Uncle Tong and them.

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.560
Big Brother, I need to tell you...

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:53.480
What should I say to them?

00:06:59.319 --> 00:07:00.680
The fairy is back

00:07:02.199 --> 00:07:03.439
Oh, come on

00:07:03.839 --> 00:07:05.759
You're always so nice after a fight

00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:07.800
Can you change your routine next time?

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:13.000
Your humble servant washed some cherry tomatoes for the fairy

00:07:13.959 --> 00:07:14.839
Alright, alright

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:16.439
Fairy

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.600
Your humble servant wants to discuss something with you

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:21.600
What is it?

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:25.240
Come back after one year in Xi'an, okay?

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.759
This long-distance life

00:07:26.759 --> 00:07:28.240
is unbearable for your humble servant

00:07:29.759 --> 00:07:30.959
Actually, I

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:34.519
was just about to discuss this with you

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:35.959
Look

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.920
The competition for the director position

00:07:40.160 --> 00:07:41.800
is extremely fierce right now

00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:44.519
And the head office's opinion is that

00:07:44.639 --> 00:07:47.360
if I stay in Xi'an for one more year

00:07:48.079 --> 00:07:49.079
it would be more secure

00:07:49.079 --> 00:07:50.120
One more year?

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.079
Then this... this director position

00:07:53.079 --> 00:07:54.920
I feel like it's not even worth having

00:07:57.759 --> 00:07:58.360
No

00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.759
The director position is important

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:03.639
but it shouldn't affect us having a baby

00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:05.199
How could it?

00:08:05.519 --> 00:08:06.759
Modern women

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:09.240
Who says you have to choose between kids and a career?

00:08:09.759 --> 00:08:11.680
And my company guarantees

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:14.360
during pregnancy and maternity leave

00:08:14.439 --> 00:08:16.319
your position and salary will be retained

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.399
Don't you dare discriminate against women

00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.560
I wouldn't dare, how could I, I don't dare

00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:22.680
That's not what I meant at all

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.040
That's more like it

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:27.120
I've also calculated

00:08:27.439 --> 00:08:30.519
if I stay in Xi'an one more year

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:32.240
the salary is already higher

00:08:32.639 --> 00:08:35.200
add in the bonuses and subsidies

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.080
and the promotion benefits

00:08:37.519 --> 00:08:39.519
that's a whole new level

00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:40.840
Why does it feel like your

00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.240
reasons are all about money?

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:43.799
What's wrong with money?

00:08:44.559 --> 00:08:46.360
Who has a problem with money?

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:17.039
Today is the last day to sign up

00:09:18.279 --> 00:09:19.080
I know

00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:21.879
I'll go think of something

00:09:34.480 --> 00:09:36.159
Qiu'er, I was just looking for you

00:09:37.039 --> 00:09:37.600
Qiu'er

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.080
What?

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:40.480
Come with me to see Big Brother

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:41.600
and persuade him to join the competition

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.480
Persuade him again?

00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:43.399
How?

00:09:44.559 --> 00:09:46.519
Things have gotten a bit out of hand

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.240
What happened?

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:51.000
I didn't realize Big Brother was hurt so deeply

00:09:51.679 --> 00:09:52.720
Of course he was

00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:53.519
I told you

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:55.320
don't use your corporate tactics on us

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:56.519
That's all cold machinery

00:09:56.519 --> 00:09:57.600
We are people

00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:58.639
Listen to me

00:09:58.639 --> 00:10:00.080
The situation is a bit tricky now

00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:01.600
Li Lianbao might be in trouble

00:10:03.879 --> 00:10:04.639
Don't scare me

00:10:04.639 --> 00:10:05.360
What kind of trouble?

00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.360
He got that funding with conditions

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:09.120
If Big Brother doesn't win the competition

00:10:09.120 --> 00:10:11.000
Li Lianbao might have to pay a huge penalty

00:10:15.320 --> 00:10:16.720
Why didn't you say so earlier?

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.000
Big Brother already has psychological issues

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:21.879
If he hears about something this big

00:10:21.879 --> 00:10:22.879
he definitely won't be able to handle it

00:10:22.879 --> 00:10:24.000
Then his condition won't improve

00:10:24.399 --> 00:10:26.000
How do you not understand Big Brother?

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.720
If it were me, I might crack under this pressure

00:10:27.720 --> 00:10:28.519
But for Big Brother

00:10:28.519 --> 00:10:30.120
a brother in trouble is his motivation

00:10:30.120 --> 00:10:31.840
Alright, stop beating around the bush, let's find Big Brother

00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.919
You should've said so earlier

00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:54.000
Putting on a sob story here

00:10:56.399 --> 00:10:58.159
It's heartbreaking to watch

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.720
But you really know how to pick a spot

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:02.360
You stay wherever the smell is

00:11:02.799 --> 00:11:04.600
Why are you putting yourself through this?

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:06.879
You think waiting here will corner Master Sun?

00:11:07.519 --> 00:11:08.879
I'm just doing this to show

00:11:08.879 --> 00:11:10.879
my sincerity and attitude

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.600
Li Lianbao

00:11:12.879 --> 00:11:14.720
Today is the deadline

00:11:14.879 --> 00:11:15.879
Should I give you one last

00:11:15.879 --> 00:11:17.360
Alright, alright, stop talking

00:11:17.879 --> 00:11:19.720
The deadline isn't until tonight, right?

00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:21.480
I still have a chance

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.240
Right, it's until tonight

00:11:25.399 --> 00:11:28.159
Fine, you wait slowly then

00:11:57.799 --> 00:11:59.600
Peng Le Xuan is a century-old brand

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.480
It must produce the ancestral flavor

00:12:01.639 --> 00:12:04.240
Your duty is to be a chef

00:12:09.759 --> 00:12:12.360
If Chunsheng doesn't roast ducks anymore

00:12:12.480 --> 00:12:15.559
can Peng Le Xuan still be called Peng Le Xuan?

00:12:19.679 --> 00:12:21.639
All these good old Beijing traditions

00:12:21.639 --> 00:12:23.399
are slowly disappearing

00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.639
The things our ancestors left behind

00:12:25.919 --> 00:12:28.120
are being lost now

00:12:32.879 --> 00:12:36.000
We must not let down the old Ma family

00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.759
the lifelong efforts of several generations

00:13:10.120 --> 00:13:12.120
Looks like there's some wiggle room here

00:13:18.879 --> 00:13:19.759
Master Sun

00:13:20.159 --> 00:13:21.559
You finally decided to show yourself

00:13:21.879 --> 00:13:23.519
Manager Li, I'm impressed

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:25.639
A scholar dies for his confidant

00:13:25.759 --> 00:13:27.000
Your every move these past two days

00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:28.679
I've seen it all

00:13:29.039 --> 00:13:31.120
It's an honor you still value me so highly

00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:32.360
If I didn't show up

00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:34.000
it would be rather ungrateful

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.360
I wouldn't dare, I wouldn't, I wouldn't

00:13:35.759 --> 00:13:38.879
So, Master Sun, you...

00:13:39.759 --> 00:13:40.879
To be honest

00:13:41.120 --> 00:13:44.360
I actually have some history with Peng Le Xuan

00:13:45.759 --> 00:13:46.639
What a coincidence

00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:50.000
My family also has a generations-old roast duck business

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:51.360
My old man

00:13:51.480 --> 00:13:53.519
even knew the manager of Peng Le Xuan

00:13:53.639 --> 00:13:56.639
One year he went to Peng Le Xuan to visit Old Man Ma

00:13:57.519 --> 00:14:00.360
and had a taste of Wang Chunsheng's roast duck

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:03.120
He couldn't stop praising it when he came back

00:14:03.440 --> 00:14:05.519
He went on and on about it to me

00:14:05.519 --> 00:14:06.360
Coincidentally

00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.240
that same day I ruined a duck I was roasting

00:14:09.039 --> 00:14:10.399
My old man

00:14:10.559 --> 00:14:12.919
insisted I was no match for Wang Chunsheng

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:16.399
and even hit my hand with a ruler until it swelled

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:18.559
There's such a story?

00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:24.000
I still remember that beating to this day

00:14:24.279 --> 00:14:25.559
Ever since then

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:29.120
I resolved to master the craft

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.360
and that's how I got to where I am today

00:14:31.279 --> 00:14:33.159
Who would have thought that Wang Chunsheng

00:14:33.799 --> 00:14:35.919
would end up in such a sorry state today

00:14:38.639 --> 00:14:41.200
Director Li, I'm willing to help you.

00:14:41.360 --> 00:14:43.120
You just have to agree to one thing.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:44.480
Please, tell me.

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:46.480
For this competition,

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.000
have Wang Chunsheng be my assistant.

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:52.240
However I order him around, he has to take it.

00:14:53.639 --> 00:14:55.120
No, wait...

00:14:55.879 --> 00:14:56.759
Master Sun.

00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.360
Please, don't hold a grudge against my Big Brother.

00:14:59.519 --> 00:15:00.480
Besides,

00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:03.120
my Big Brother doesn't even know about this.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:04.360
Look,

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.879
I'll apologize to you on my Big Brother's behalf.

00:15:06.879 --> 00:15:08.480
No, Director Li.

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:11.000
This has nothing to do with you.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:14.000
I'm targeting Wang Chunsheng.

00:15:14.639 --> 00:15:17.000
No, but that was so many years ago.

00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:18.240
Why bother?

00:15:18.799 --> 00:15:19.519
Director Li,

00:15:20.279 --> 00:15:22.519
if you're really in a difficult position,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.519
then just find someone else.

00:15:24.519 --> 00:15:25.759
No, no, no, Master Sun.

00:15:25.759 --> 00:15:26.519
Listen,

00:15:26.519 --> 00:15:28.360
do me a favor, will you?

00:15:28.559 --> 00:15:31.799
I just can't swallow my anger towards Wang Chunsheng.

00:15:32.759 --> 00:15:34.480
I have to completely humiliate him.

00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.360
Dream on.

00:15:36.360 --> 00:15:37.120
I'll slap you.

00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:37.759
You dare? Look,

00:15:37.759 --> 00:15:39.240
th-there are security cameras here.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.120
Go ahead, try it.

00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:40.759
Get lost.

00:15:40.759 --> 00:15:41.960
Just you wait, just you wait.

00:15:44.639 --> 00:15:46.279
So what if it's death?

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:47.759
I'll face it head-on.

00:16:10.399 --> 00:16:12.879
Second Uncle, you're a real man.

00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:13.720
Uncle.

00:16:15.759 --> 00:16:16.519
Enough already.

00:16:16.519 --> 00:16:17.639
He's a tough guy.

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:22.080
I've really messed up Peng Le Xuan this time.

00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:24.759
Second Brother.

00:16:26.039 --> 00:16:26.480
Big Brother.

00:16:26.480 --> 00:16:27.519
What do you mean by this?

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:29.720
Such a big issue, and you don't discuss it with me?

00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:30.600
What's wrong, Big Brother?

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.399
What kind of person do you think I am?

00:16:32.399 --> 00:16:33.000
No.

00:16:33.519 --> 00:16:35.080
Why did you call Big Brother here?

00:16:35.519 --> 00:16:37.080
I brought this photo.

00:16:37.879 --> 00:16:39.480
Go sign me up right now.

00:16:39.879 --> 00:16:40.840
I'll make roast duck

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:43.639
and represent Peng Le Xuan in the Duck King Competition.

00:16:45.759 --> 00:16:46.600
Big Brother.

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.120
You're not angry anymore?

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:52.960
Listen, things are a bit tricky now.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:54.399
Li Lianbao might be in trouble.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.159
Why didn't you say so earlier?

00:16:57.320 --> 00:16:58.840
This really is a bit troublesome.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:17:00.519
If we don't win the championship,

00:17:00.519 --> 00:17:02.639
Lianbao will lose all his money.

00:17:02.919 --> 00:17:04.000
Really, Weiguo?

00:17:04.839 --> 00:17:06.359
You're something else.

00:17:06.359 --> 00:17:07.279
What time is it now?

00:17:07.279 --> 00:17:08.400
And you're still hiding things from me?

00:17:11.359 --> 00:17:12.359
Let's go.

00:17:18.519 --> 00:17:20.119
Even if I'm angry with you,

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:22.640
when you're in trouble,

00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:24.599
I have to go all out for you.

00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.599
Listen up, you little brats.

00:17:28.519 --> 00:17:30.880
I don't care what you think of me.

00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.759
I always believe I'm your Big Brother.

00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:36.720
If the sky falls,

00:17:36.880 --> 00:17:40.160
even if Big Brother gets a skull smashed to pieces,

00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.240
Big Brother will still hold it up for you.

00:17:44.839 --> 00:17:47.599
Big Brother, you'll always be my Big Brother.

00:17:48.279 --> 00:17:49.599
Don't give me that.

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:52.960
Shouldn't we take a photo at a moment like this?

00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.079
Look at me, quick.

00:17:54.079 --> 00:17:54.480
Come on.

00:17:54.480 --> 00:17:55.519
Yes, yes, come on, come on.

00:17:55.839 --> 00:17:57.000
Dad, smile, Dad.

00:17:57.000 --> 00:17:58.119
Put your hand on there.

00:17:58.160 --> 00:18:01.160
Quick, one, two, three.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:02.960
One more.

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:05.079
One, two, three.

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:06.640
Dad, smile, smile.

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:07.960
Alright, let's go sign up.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.079
Go, go.

00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:36.720
Don't you have anything to say to me?

00:18:37.400 --> 00:18:38.200
Say what?

00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:40.920
The four of you are reconciled.

00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:42.680
I should get some credit, right?

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:45.400
Aren't you just gathering material

00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:46.680
for your photography exhibition?

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:49.200
You... I gather material?

00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:50.119
Thank you.

00:18:50.839 --> 00:18:51.559
Really.

00:18:52.599 --> 00:18:53.359
Thank you.

00:18:55.119 --> 00:18:56.079
I was joking.

00:18:56.079 --> 00:18:57.079
I was using a tactic.

00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:58.119
It's a tactic.

00:18:58.119 --> 00:18:59.359
You're not street-smart enough.

00:19:01.119 --> 00:19:02.119
You...

00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:06.079
I'm leaving first.

00:19:30.079 --> 00:19:30.799
Thanks.

00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:04.599
Brother Wang, so early.

00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:08.359
Our roast duck shop is being renovated.

00:20:08.359 --> 00:20:10.279
I'd like to borrow your kitchen.

00:20:10.359 --> 00:20:11.400
No problem, no problem.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.519
Come on, come on in, come in.

00:20:12.519 --> 00:20:13.519
Alright, alright.

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.519
Master Wang.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.039
Dad, here, have some water.

00:21:21.839 --> 00:21:22.480
Here, here.

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.079
Water, water.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:33.680
Dad, tell me,

00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:35.319
we've been eating it for days now.

00:21:36.519 --> 00:21:38.160
Why do you still vomit as soon as you eat?

00:21:38.480 --> 00:21:39.839
This is already much better.

00:21:40.079 --> 00:21:41.200
You know, before,

00:21:41.920 --> 00:21:43.839
I couldn't even bear to hear the word "duck."

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.519
I couldn't stand the smell either.

00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.680
At least now I can put it in my mouth.

00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.759
But to restore the ancestral skill,

00:21:52.200 --> 00:21:54.079
can I manage without tasting it?

00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.119
Let's do it.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.839
If you keep vomiting like this,

00:23:01.839 --> 00:23:03.200
you'll damage your stomach lining.

00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:03.680
Right, right.

00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:04.599
How about we call it a day today?

00:23:04.599 --> 00:23:06.440
Yes, Dad, let's stop for today.

00:23:06.759 --> 00:23:07.759
Let's rest a bit.

00:23:12.519 --> 00:23:13.960
Let's stop today, okay?

00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:15.880
No, the competition is in just a few days.

00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:17.680
Even if I vomit up my gallbladder today,

00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.920
I have to keep tasting.

00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:27.359
You're seeing the doctor and getting medicine,

00:23:27.359 --> 00:23:28.680
and you won't even let me go with you.

00:23:29.279 --> 00:23:30.759
I'm afraid you'll worry.

00:23:42.759 --> 00:23:44.119
Let me get you some water.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:47.960
It's fine, I'll have a banana.

00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:57.400
Why would Big Brother suddenly decide to enter the competition?

00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.640
I didn't expect it either.

00:24:00.119 --> 00:24:01.480
But it should be fine.

00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:03.200
He's entering at the last minute.

00:24:03.279 --> 00:24:05.079
He shouldn't pose a threat.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:09.640
No.

00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:11.799
We can't give Peng Le Xuan any chance.

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:12.880
Weiguo.

00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:14.680
You need to constantly assess the risks for me.

00:24:14.680 --> 00:24:16.440
Tell me immediately if anything changes.

00:24:17.559 --> 00:24:18.359
Don't worry.

00:24:18.759 --> 00:24:20.440
I'll give you a satisfactory result.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:24:59.920
Hey.

00:25:00.920 --> 00:25:02.960
It's already one o'clock.

00:25:03.079 --> 00:25:05.480
Maybe you should finish this summary tomorrow?

00:25:06.559 --> 00:25:08.279
Don't interrupt my train of thought.

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:18.440
Have some water. Here.

00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:19.640
You know what?

00:25:20.799 --> 00:25:22.319
Scouting those shops...

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.640
...was actually quite fruitful.

00:25:26.160 --> 00:25:26.680
Here.

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:50.240
Hey.

00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:53.720
How did you...

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:56.200
...get more and more handsome?

00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.920
What? What fell?

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.279
Go on, write.

00:26:03.279 --> 00:26:04.640
It's fine. It's okay.

00:26:26.759 --> 00:26:27.559
Chinese people...

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:36.759
...come on!

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.880
If I hadn't put in so many good words for you,

00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:55.640
would Feifei trust you so quickly?

00:26:58.039 --> 00:26:58.720
Fine.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:01.200
Go ahead, say it.

00:27:01.599 --> 00:27:02.599
What exactly do you want?

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.039
It's really nothing much.

00:27:05.240 --> 00:27:07.240
Where are you taking Feifei tomorrow to broaden his horizons?

00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.200
Count me in.

00:27:09.640 --> 00:27:10.920
I won't bother you two.

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.119
I won't interfere either.

00:27:12.319 --> 00:27:13.640
I'll just be responsible for taking photos.

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:16.200
Just think of me as a human-shaped camera.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:20.319
I have other plans tomorrow.

00:27:20.319 --> 00:27:21.640
Didn't I say? I'm very busy.

00:27:22.279 --> 00:27:24.119
What about the day after?

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:25.799
Or the day after that.

00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:27.559
In short, you have to take me with you.

00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.160
And if I don't agree?

00:27:31.799 --> 00:27:33.720
Well, if you don't agree...

00:27:34.559 --> 00:27:36.680
...then I'll have to agree to my uncle's request.

00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:38.160
To take Feifei away from you.

00:28:44.279 --> 00:28:48.680
Glioma targeted medication.

00:29:41.119 --> 00:29:41.799
It's coming up.

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:49.400
What's wrong?

00:29:51.680 --> 00:29:53.480
Do you still remember my grandfather?

00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.039
I remember.

00:29:56.039 --> 00:29:56.880
Of course I remember.

00:29:58.079 --> 00:29:59.960
I even remember when you were one year old,

00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:01.200
your father brought you back.

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:02.799
And then?

00:30:02.799 --> 00:30:04.400
Your grandfather went with you...

00:30:05.119 --> 00:30:06.000
...abroad.

00:30:06.599 --> 00:30:07.960
He didn't want to go originally.

00:30:10.160 --> 00:30:11.160
But after seeing me,

00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:12.279
he still went.

00:30:15.640 --> 00:30:17.359
Time really flies.

00:30:17.799 --> 00:30:18.759
In the blink of an eye,

00:30:20.119 --> 00:30:21.519
you've become a young lady.

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.799
My grandfather stayed with me abroad for over ten years.

00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:36.880
The first phrase I learned was,

00:30:37.599 --> 00:30:38.880
"Have you eaten?"

00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:41.920
He also showed me...

00:30:42.599 --> 00:30:43.920
...a lot of...

00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:45.400
...old Beijing photos.

00:30:46.640 --> 00:30:47.440
No wonder...

00:30:48.039 --> 00:30:49.960
...you're so interested in old Beijing things.

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:52.000
He died of cancer.

00:30:54.880 --> 00:30:55.599
Really?

00:30:57.400 --> 00:30:58.279
Kidney cancer.

00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:02.880
After the surgery to remove it,

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.279
three months later,

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:08.119
it was found to have spread to his brain.

00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:10.680
Before he passed away,

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:12.960
he always wanted to return to Beijing for a visit.

00:31:13.319 --> 00:31:14.920
He wanted to go back to Baofang Hutong.

00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:20.079
He finally booked a plane ticket later.

00:31:23.079 --> 00:31:24.720
But he never made it to that moment.

00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:28.640
I think...

00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:32.519
...this must have been his biggest regret in life.

00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:42.680
Do you know something?

00:31:54.039 --> 00:31:55.279
Can I give you a hug?

00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:13.559
About this matter...

00:32:15.759 --> 00:32:17.119
You must keep it a secret for me.

00:32:19.559 --> 00:32:21.079
I don't want anyone to know.

00:32:23.559 --> 00:32:25.319
I don't want anyone's pity either.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:29.039
Understand?

00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:30.640
I understand.

00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.119
I get it.

00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.519
Hello? Sister Tongtong?

00:33:59.519 --> 00:34:00.640
Hello? Feifei.

00:34:01.839 --> 00:34:03.119
I suddenly have an urgent matter tomorrow.

00:34:03.119 --> 00:34:04.720
I can't make it to that Duck King Competition.

00:34:04.839 --> 00:34:07.279
Can you help me shoot some footage?

00:34:07.279 --> 00:34:08.159
Use my camera.

00:34:08.159 --> 00:34:09.280
You know how to use it, right?

00:34:09.280 --> 00:34:10.480
No problem, I can use it.

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.360
Okay, thank you.

00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.199
Sorry to trouble you.

00:34:12.199 --> 00:34:13.559
It's fine. Get some rest early.

00:34:36.760 --> 00:34:41.440
Cognitive decline.

00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:09.119
I don't know why,

00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.400
but the burden I carry now feels exceptionally heavy.

00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.000
The pill feels like a shot put ball,

00:35:16.559 --> 00:35:19.079
impossible to swallow even with lots of water.

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:23.599
This feeling isn't from my condition worsening.

00:35:25.840 --> 00:35:27.559
It comes from an abyss.

00:35:28.039 --> 00:35:29.639
A vortex, though filled with goodwill,

00:35:30.079 --> 00:35:32.119
that makes it hard to stand up straight.

00:35:40.679 --> 00:35:41.920
But it's laughable.

00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.559
At a time like this,

00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.440
I'm actually asking myself:

00:35:46.519 --> 00:35:48.280
What's more important?

00:35:48.519 --> 00:35:49.960
Living, or the meaning of living?

00:35:56.599 --> 00:35:58.760
You guys, help me taste this.

00:35:59.639 --> 00:36:02.280
Tell me your thoughts, quick.

00:36:02.719 --> 00:36:03.199
Come on.

00:36:03.559 --> 00:36:04.280
Come on, come on.

00:36:04.280 --> 00:36:05.039
Come on, come on.

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.440
Try a plain piece.

00:36:17.639 --> 00:36:18.719
Not bad.

00:36:19.519 --> 00:36:20.079
Good.

00:36:20.559 --> 00:36:21.639
H-how is it?

00:36:22.679 --> 00:36:24.239
Well? Any feedback?

00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:26.599
It's the old flavor.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.280
It's the taste from our childhood.

00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:35.119
So fragrant.

00:36:45.679 --> 00:36:46.920
Don't forget anything.

00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.239
Come on, let me take a couple photos of you two.

00:36:52.639 --> 00:36:54.880
Can you not create a tense atmosphere?

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:55.960
Come on, come on.

00:36:56.719 --> 00:36:58.360
Alright, count me in too.

00:36:58.800 --> 00:36:59.679
What else?

00:37:00.599 --> 00:37:01.000
All good.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:01.800
Okay, okay, okay.

00:37:02.239 --> 00:37:03.039
Take a look.

00:37:03.039 --> 00:37:03.519
Look.

00:37:03.519 --> 00:37:05.559
Hat, apron, and water.

00:37:05.559 --> 00:37:06.440
Do you have them all?

00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.119
Got them.

00:37:09.119 --> 00:37:09.599
Let's go.

00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:10.320
Let's go.

00:37:31.079 --> 00:37:33.320
Distinguished judges,

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.000
fellow contestants,

00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:37.119
and all friends in the audience,

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:38.159
hello, everyone.

00:37:42.440 --> 00:37:44.199
It's an honor to participate in

00:37:44.199 --> 00:37:46.840
Beijing's 8th Folk Duck King Culinary Competition.

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.719
I'm your host, Qihang.

00:37:48.719 --> 00:37:49.679
Here and now,

00:37:49.679 --> 00:37:52.079
I'd like to share some of the rules

00:37:52.079 --> 00:37:54.400
for this competition.

00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:57.360
The competition spans two days.

00:37:58.079 --> 00:37:58.920
On the first day,

00:37:59.039 --> 00:38:02.320
we hold the individual duck slicing contest

00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:05.960
and the comprehensive roast duck skills contest.

00:38:06.079 --> 00:38:09.159
Based on the combined scores from both events,

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:13.239
we will select three outstanding contestants

00:38:13.239 --> 00:38:17.840
to compete in the second day's full duck banquet showdown,

00:38:18.239 --> 00:38:20.840
to determine this year's Duck King.

00:38:20.840 --> 00:38:23.679
Let's wait and see.

00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.679
The master chef beside me

00:38:28.679 --> 00:38:29.320
is very famous.

00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:32.199
He is from Spring River Warms,

00:38:32.199 --> 00:38:34.039
Master Chef Sun Yanhui.

00:38:34.039 --> 00:38:35.199
Let's give him a round of applause.

00:38:37.239 --> 00:38:39.320
I must specially emphasize here

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:43.280
that Master Chef Sun was last year's Duck King Competition

00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:45.000
runner-up.

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:45.679
Great.

00:38:48.320 --> 00:38:49.320
Here,

00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.239
I also wish you even better results

00:38:52.239 --> 00:38:53.679
in this year's Duck King Competition.

00:38:53.679 --> 00:38:54.320
Thank you.

00:38:54.320 --> 00:38:55.840
Now, the one beside me here

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:56.840
is also very famous.

00:38:56.840 --> 00:38:59.840
Peng Le Xuan's Master Chef Wang Chunsheng.

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:01.559
His culinary skills are equally superb.

00:39:02.159 --> 00:39:03.639
Go, Dad!

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:12.519
Master Chef Cao from Duck Workshop,

00:39:12.519 --> 00:39:13.679
and also from
