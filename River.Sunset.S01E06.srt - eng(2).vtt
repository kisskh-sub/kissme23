WEBVTT

00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:12.399
Major Ferguson reporting.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.960
Have a seat.

00:02:17.759 --> 00:02:18.840
Sorry, Major.

00:02:19.119 --> 00:02:20.000
You might have to

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:20.960
stay here a few more days.

00:02:21.359 --> 00:02:22.240
Why?

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:24.399
After the British retreat,

00:02:24.479 --> 00:02:26.039
the Japs have blocked

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:27.600
all our routes to the China theater.

00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:29.799
We're planning to open a new route.

00:02:30.439 --> 00:02:32.000
But I told them you're stuck here.

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:33.399
Colonel,

00:02:33.399 --> 00:02:34.560
I must reach China

00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:35.200
by April fifteenth.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:36.560
We still have some time,

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:37.879
but we must act fast.

00:02:38.719 --> 00:02:40.079
Look at this map.

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:42.159
The only possible route

00:02:42.159 --> 00:02:43.799
is to fly over the Himalayas.

00:02:44.359 --> 00:02:46.680
Those peaks are five miles high.

00:02:47.159 --> 00:02:49.159
Our planes can't fly that high.

00:02:49.359 --> 00:02:51.200
We have no maps of that area yet.

00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.599
Radio navigation

00:02:52.959 --> 00:02:55.560
and the actual weather there are unknowns.

00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.000
Colonel,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.599
it sounds like you're saying our mission

00:02:56.599 --> 00:02:57.640
is impossible.

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.319
Don't give up yet, Major.

00:03:00.519 --> 00:03:01.920
Our pilots are pioneering

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:03.439
a route over the Himalayas.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.640
You'll have to stand by until departure.

00:03:15.439 --> 00:03:17.040
Seven-Seven-Zero-Three,

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:20.400
prepare for takeoff on a two-hundred-fifty-meter runway.

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:23.840
Seven-Seven-Zero-Three, ready.

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.519
Seven-Seven-Zero-Three, cleared for takeoff.

00:03:37.359 --> 00:03:39.199
Well done, Jimmy.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:40.400
I'm very pleased

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.240
with your pilots' performance.

00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:41.879
Colonel,

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:43.240
since you proposed this crazy idea,

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.919
we've certainly accomplished a lot.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:47.159
The boys were initially convinced

00:03:47.159 --> 00:03:48.800
they were going to bomb Hitler.

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:49.240
That's fine.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.840
We are considering bombing Hitler.

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:52.680
Jimmy,

00:03:53.159 --> 00:03:54.560
Admiral Halsey will soon arrive in

00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:55.800
San Francisco.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:56.400
He wants

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.000
you to brief him on this mission.

00:03:58.599 --> 00:04:01.240
Even though I saw your good work today,

00:04:01.240 --> 00:04:03.240
the Navy still isn't confident a bomber

00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:04.599
fully loaded with fuel and bombs

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:08.400
can take off from a carrier.

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.560
I'd be happy to test-fly from a carrier myself,

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.280
to show the Admiral.

00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.439
Good, you do it.

00:04:13.759 --> 00:04:16.280
That would be the most convincing proof.

00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:18.319
I've heard

00:04:19.039 --> 00:04:20.439
your squadron's B-25s

00:04:20.439 --> 00:04:21.520
can't all fit on

00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:22.719
the Hornet's deck.

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.199
That deck can only handle fifteen planes.

00:04:26.199 --> 00:04:28.400
Sixteen at best.

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:32.439
That's a shame.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.800
With only sixteen, we can't

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.159
do much damage to Tokyo.

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.520
Even with all twenty-four,

00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:40.039
we wouldn't do much damage.

00:04:40.319 --> 00:04:40.719
Listen.

00:04:41.039 --> 00:04:42.000
The key to this mission is

00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.360
to warn the Japs,

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.280
not to cause massive destruction.

00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:47.560
Not everyone gets to be a hero.

00:04:48.479 --> 00:04:50.919
Good pilots are needed for other missions.

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.199
Those who don't go on this mission

00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:56.599
will be assigned to other duties.

00:04:56.919 --> 00:04:58.439
Maybe even bombing Hitler in Europe.

00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.879
Find a chance to tell the men, okay?

00:05:20.439 --> 00:05:21.360
Men,

00:05:24.599 --> 00:05:24.879
as of today,

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:26.199
our first phase of training

00:05:26.199 --> 00:05:27.360
is nearly complete.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.280
I appreciate all the effort

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.759
you've put into the B-25s.

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:33.159
There's still a lot of work ahead.

00:05:33.319 --> 00:05:34.120
Colonel, do you mean

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:35.879
adding another broomstick?

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:36.680
I bet

00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.520
Hitler's scared shitless right now.

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.080
Many keep asking me

00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:43.199
what this mission really is.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.040
I can only repeat what I've said before.

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.040
This mission is extremely dangerous.

00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.519
This mission is extremely dangerous.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:50.759
Do not reveal to anyone

00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:52.759
what we're doing or where we're going.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:54.879
Not even if your mother asks.

00:05:55.519 --> 00:05:56.560
I'm talking to you.

00:05:57.879 --> 00:06:00.639
This is all top secret.

00:06:01.439 --> 00:06:02.439
I'll tell you later

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:04.199
what you need to know.

00:06:05.199 --> 00:06:06.480
Any questions?

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.959
No, sir.

00:06:07.959 --> 00:06:09.560
Anyone having second thoughts,

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:11.160
anyone who wants out,

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:13.319
tell me now and you can withdraw.

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:16.319
Good.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:20.120
Tomorrow, our squadron's B-25s

00:06:20.759 --> 00:06:22.639
will all fly to

00:06:22.639 --> 00:06:23.839
McClellan Airfield in Sacramento.

00:06:24.639 --> 00:06:26.480
After the transfer,

00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:27.959
our training focus

00:06:27.959 --> 00:06:30.399
will be ultra-short takeoffs.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.240
A new crew of mechanics will be there.

00:06:34.519 --> 00:06:35.639
Lawson, Cole,

00:06:35.839 --> 00:06:38.079
I'm putting you two in charge of overseeing them.

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:39.560
Speed things up.

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:40.439
Yes, sir.

00:06:40.439 --> 00:06:41.399
That's all.

00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:42.720
Have a good evening.

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:43.600
Alright.

00:06:44.600 --> 00:06:45.879
Ultra-short takeoffs.

00:06:48.439 --> 00:06:49.360
What'll you have today?

00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.639
Whiskey.

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:53.160
Sir,

00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:55.000
are you really going to Europe to bomb Hitler?

00:06:56.199 --> 00:06:57.759
Hitler, Yamamoto, Mussolini...

00:06:57.800 --> 00:06:58.319
Take your pick.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.680
I'll fly you there myself to meet him.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:01.759
You can jump out and say hello.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.560
This one's on me.

00:07:16.199 --> 00:07:17.720
Dinner is now served.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.480
Guests may proceed to the dining room.

00:07:22.519 --> 00:07:23.360
Miss Ye.

00:07:23.399 --> 00:07:24.759
It's time for dinner.

00:07:31.839 --> 00:07:32.519
Care to join me?

00:07:33.079 --> 00:07:33.800
What?

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:35.720
Well,

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:37.519
the announcement just now said

00:07:37.519 --> 00:07:39.120
dinner is being served on board.

00:07:39.240 --> 00:07:39.879
Shall we go together?

00:07:41.040 --> 00:07:43.560
After all, we're the only two Chinese on the ship.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:45.920
Alright then.

00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:47.600
Wait for me a moment.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:26.319
Hello.

00:08:45.199 --> 00:08:46.240
What are you talking about?

00:08:50.199 --> 00:08:51.240
This Fukuda,

00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:53.519
he runs a trading company on the island.

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.360
From Tanjiawan to Shangbiao Village

00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:58.040
To the air base naval dock

00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.040
He has shops everywhere.

00:08:59.839 --> 00:09:01.959
Even the cigarettes Commander Fujita smokes

00:09:02.040 --> 00:09:03.199
are supplied by him.

00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:06.079
He named all his shops

00:09:06.079 --> 00:09:07.800
"New Nagasaki."

00:09:08.519 --> 00:09:11.000
I think he wants to one day

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.519
turn Sanzao Island into a new Nagasaki.

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:14.439
That way, he'd be the supreme commander,

00:09:14.439 --> 00:09:16.879
and General Fujita would just be one of his generals.

00:09:18.759 --> 00:09:20.680
I just got a new batch of cigars

00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:21.800
from the concession in Shanghai.

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:23.639
Let's go try them.

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:24.600
Let's go.

00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.240
Let me tell you,

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:33.399
that guy...

00:09:33.839 --> 00:09:35.360
He's the only one authorized by the island's

00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.879
Special Police Corps

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.040
to run comfort stations.

00:09:40.279 --> 00:09:42.519
He hired over twenty immigrants from Okinawa

00:09:42.519 --> 00:09:43.600
to work for him.

00:09:44.399 --> 00:09:48.800
He deals in everything from daily goods to grain.

00:09:49.279 --> 00:09:50.199
Basically, anything

00:09:50.199 --> 00:09:52.600
that can be bought with money

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.319
has some connection to him.

00:09:56.639 --> 00:09:57.560
Miss Ye,

00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:00.160
if you ever need anything on the island,

00:10:00.519 --> 00:10:01.399
you can come to me.

00:10:01.399 --> 00:10:03.360
After all, it's easier for me.

00:10:05.159 --> 00:10:06.039
Thank you.

00:10:06.039 --> 00:10:06.919
His

00:10:07.759 --> 00:10:09.919
darn backer is the Special Police Corps.

00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.759
But he's just

00:10:12.799 --> 00:10:14.639
one of Oshima Hiroshi's dogs.

00:10:18.799 --> 00:10:21.240
What brings you to the island this time?

00:10:22.519 --> 00:10:23.559
I'm going home.

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.200
Home?

00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.279
My home is on Sanzao Island.

00:10:29.159 --> 00:10:30.840
My father is Ye Degong.

00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:35.519
So you're Ye Degong's daughter!

00:10:35.759 --> 00:10:36.840
You know my father?

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.480
Of course.

00:10:38.399 --> 00:10:39.360
How is he?

00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:40.840
He's fine.

00:10:40.919 --> 00:10:41.559
He's doing well.

00:10:41.559 --> 00:10:42.720
His health is also very good.

00:10:43.399 --> 00:10:44.039
That's good to hear.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.799
I've long heard that Ye Degong's daughter

00:10:45.799 --> 00:10:46.840
was studying abroad.

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:47.960
So it's you.

00:10:48.559 --> 00:10:49.480
Commander Fujita,

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:51.080
when he was in the US before,

00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:52.360
served as a military attaché assistant.

00:10:52.639 --> 00:10:54.840
Your father was a diplomat.

00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.039
So Commander Fujita

00:10:56.039 --> 00:10:57.879
very much enjoys chatting with your father.

00:10:59.399 --> 00:11:01.919
But perhaps because the military

00:11:01.919 --> 00:11:04.320
seized your family's mansion,

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:05.279
your father

00:11:05.279 --> 00:11:06.759
hasn't been very welcoming.

00:11:59.279 --> 00:11:59.720
Hey!

00:12:00.279 --> 00:12:01.080
What's your business?

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.600
From the Maintenance Association.

00:12:04.639 --> 00:12:06.519
Who sent you?

00:12:07.080 --> 00:12:09.440
Captain Inoue told me to come.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.000
Go on up.

00:12:11.679 --> 00:12:12.200
Okay.

00:12:31.879 --> 00:12:33.080
Chairman Tang.

00:12:35.399 --> 00:12:36.200
Upstairs,

00:12:39.639 --> 00:12:40.720
Captain Inoue...

00:12:41.559 --> 00:12:42.480
Chairman Tang.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:44.600
Can you guarantee

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.320
your loyalty to the Imperial Army?

00:12:47.399 --> 00:12:48.320
Captain Inoue,

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:50.120
my loyalty to the Imperial Army

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:51.399
has always been unwavering.

00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:52.200
Wrong.

00:12:53.799 --> 00:12:56.000
You're hiding many things.

00:12:56.399 --> 00:12:56.960
No, no...

00:12:57.159 --> 00:12:57.720
No.

00:12:58.159 --> 00:12:59.720
Absolutely not!

00:13:09.039 --> 00:13:09.879
Recently,

00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:11.559
we've received some reports.

00:13:12.519 --> 00:13:14.120
In Shangbiao Village,

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.799
Tanjiawan Village,

00:13:15.799 --> 00:13:17.679
and many other homes,

00:13:17.679 --> 00:13:19.240
there are secret rooms built.

00:13:20.919 --> 00:13:22.360
Why haven't you reported

00:13:23.279 --> 00:13:26.679
this matter to us?

00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.159
Captain Inoue,

00:13:29.519 --> 00:13:31.279
it... it's like this.

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:33.919
Not every family on this island

00:13:33.919 --> 00:13:35.240
has a secret room.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.559
Poor families don't have secret rooms.

00:13:39.639 --> 00:13:40.480
Come up.

00:13:44.279 --> 00:13:45.120
Alright.

00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:56.840
Captain Inoue,

00:13:58.279 --> 00:13:59.440
you don't know,

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:02.799
this area used to have pirate troubles.

00:14:03.639 --> 00:14:05.279
The wealthy families on the island,

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:07.480
when building their mansions,

00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:08.840
they built secret rooms.

00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:10.279
When pirates came,

00:14:10.679 --> 00:14:12.279
to hide valuables,

00:14:12.279 --> 00:14:14.279
family members, and food.

00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:15.399
I see.

00:14:16.159 --> 00:14:17.080
So then,

00:14:17.399 --> 00:14:19.200
does the Tan family in the east of the village have one?

00:14:19.679 --> 00:14:20.159
Yes.

00:14:20.759 --> 00:14:22.559
What about that Old Chen

00:14:22.559 --> 00:14:23.519
from the ancestral hall last time?

00:14:23.519 --> 00:14:24.159
Yes.

00:14:24.559 --> 00:14:26.000
Ye Degong, does the Ye family have one too?

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:26.759
Yes, they do.

00:14:35.559 --> 00:14:36.799
So tell me,

00:14:37.440 --> 00:14:40.360
where do these wealthy families

00:14:40.559 --> 00:14:42.039
usually build their secret rooms?

00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:42.799
This...

00:14:42.799 --> 00:14:44.320
I really don't know.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:48.159
I've heard some are built in attics,

00:14:48.159 --> 00:14:50.039
and some are built underground.

00:14:50.399 --> 00:14:51.840
Secret rooms are secret rooms.

00:14:52.039 --> 00:14:54.720
They must be in secret places.

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:56.360
That makes sense.

00:14:56.919 --> 00:14:58.759
So, does anyone on the island know?

00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:00.799
No.

00:15:00.799 --> 00:15:01.159
These...

00:15:01.759 --> 00:15:02.919
These wealthy families,

00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.600
when they build secret rooms,

00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.600
hire people from off the island.

00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.720
People on the island can't find them.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.759
Tang...

00:15:12.759 --> 00:15:13.840
You know

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:16.919
the consequences of hiding things from me.

00:15:17.759 --> 00:15:18.559
No!

00:15:18.559 --> 00:15:20.279
I ab-absolutely wouldn't dare!

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.120
Every word I said is true!

00:15:25.399 --> 00:15:26.000
Alright.

00:15:27.840 --> 00:15:28.879
Today,

00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:30.360
I called you here

00:15:30.919 --> 00:15:33.320
for a very important matter

00:15:33.639 --> 00:15:35.559
that your Maintenance Association must handle.

00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.279
A few days ago,

00:15:40.279 --> 00:15:42.799
we shot down an American plane.

00:15:43.639 --> 00:15:46.200
One person from the plane is still missing.

00:15:46.639 --> 00:15:48.600
Your Association will notify

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:50.200
all the villagers on the island.

00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.159
Anyone providing a lead

00:15:53.799 --> 00:15:56.440
will be rewarded by our Special Police Corps

00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.679
with fifty jin of rice

00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:01.279
and twenty jin of pork.

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:02.960
But,

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:05.000
if anyone withholds information

00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.799
or intentionally hides someone,

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.840
their entire family will be shot.

00:16:12.519 --> 00:16:13.440
Understood?

00:16:13.559 --> 00:16:14.200
Und-

00:16:15.039 --> 00:16:16.080
Understood.

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:17.679
Good.

00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:18.639
Then

00:16:19.519 --> 00:16:20.360
you may go.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.639
It seems there really are secret rooms on the island.

00:16:33.639 --> 00:16:36.399
I really admire you.

00:16:36.399 --> 00:16:38.080
How did you know?

00:16:38.919 --> 00:16:41.440
Even an old woman who does laundry and cooking

00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:42.440
has a hidden cellar in her home.

00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:43.440
Other families wouldn't be without them.

00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:45.080
I see.

00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.799
This American who fell from the plane

00:16:48.799 --> 00:16:50.440
either drowned in the sea,

00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.159
his hat washed ashore,

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:53.759
or,

00:16:53.759 --> 00:16:55.320
he's currently hiding

00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:57.639
in a secret room in some village house.

00:16:57.639 --> 00:16:59.080
That's why we found nothing in our search.

00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.039
So you think

00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:03.720
Ye Degong

00:17:04.240 --> 00:17:06.639
is most likely hiding him in his house?

00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.559
Among the island's residents,

00:17:09.559 --> 00:17:10.840
only the Ye family can communicate

00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:13.840
with Americans, they know English.

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.639
And those few wealthy households on the island.

00:17:16.320 --> 00:17:17.159
But,

00:17:17.159 --> 00:17:20.960
it's not impossible.

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.000
Therefore,

00:17:22.519 --> 00:17:23.639
I had the Maintenance Association

00:17:23.639 --> 00:17:26.159
create a tense atmosphere first.

00:17:28.519 --> 00:17:31.200
Then I'll take men to search the village again tomorrow,

00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:34.600
and dig out all their secret rooms.

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.799
We will dig them out, of course.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:36.879
But for now,

00:17:36.879 --> 00:17:39.279
we haven't located the secret rooms.

00:17:39.799 --> 00:17:41.080
We must find the right opportunity.

00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:44.840
First, have your men keep watch on the Ye house.

00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:46.519
If anything suspicious is found,

00:17:46.519 --> 00:17:47.840
report to me immediately.

00:17:49.519 --> 00:17:50.159
Yes, sir.

00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:51.559
Goodbye.

00:18:26.679 --> 00:18:28.519
We're almost there.

00:18:28.519 --> 00:18:29.559
Yes.

00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:38.559
Sound the alarm!

00:18:38.559 --> 00:18:39.359
Mines!

00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:43.799
What's happening?

00:18:43.799 --> 00:18:45.319
What's going on?

00:18:48.720 --> 00:18:49.559
Look over there!

00:18:49.559 --> 00:18:50.240
Mines!

00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:51.480
Mines!

00:18:51.480 --> 00:18:54.200
There are mines!

00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:56.920
Where are the mines?

00:18:57.519 --> 00:18:58.079
What's wrong?

00:18:58.079 --> 00:18:58.880
What is that?

00:18:58.880 --> 00:19:00.640
Watch out for mines!

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.200
Hard to port!

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.039
Turn left!

00:19:05.039 --> 00:19:05.359
Aye!

00:19:05.359 --> 00:19:05.920
Hard to port!

00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:06.160
Good!

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:06.880
Good!

00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:16.960
There are mines!

00:19:17.759 --> 00:19:19.920
What do we do?

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:10.960
Thank goodness.

00:20:10.960 --> 00:20:12.039
That scared me to death.

00:20:12.039 --> 00:20:13.119
We're incredibly lucky.

00:20:13.759 --> 00:20:15.400
It's great it didn't explode.

00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.279
We're safe.

00:20:52.319 --> 00:20:53.559
We've encountered enemy gunboats!

00:20:53.559 --> 00:20:54.559
Organize resistance!

00:20:54.559 --> 00:20:55.400
Don't let them get close!

00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:55.880
Hurry!

00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:09.319
Hurry!

00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:56.880
Miss Ye!

00:21:58.319 --> 00:21:59.319
Miss Ye!

00:22:02.319 --> 00:22:03.440
Put the gun away!

00:22:03.440 --> 00:22:05.200
Quick, go! The ship is sinking!

00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:09.839
Hurry!

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:10.759
Base,

00:22:10.759 --> 00:22:11.720
this is the Amemaru.

00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.839
We are under attack at 113 degrees east,

00:22:12.839 --> 00:22:14.400
22 degrees north latitude.

00:22:14.400 --> 00:22:15.960
Less than twenty nautical miles from base.

00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:17.160
Requesting support!

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.200
Miss Ye!

00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.200
Go, get out of here!

00:23:40.039 --> 00:23:42.119
This person is a spy!

00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:19.200
Miss Ye!

00:24:22.279 --> 00:24:23.559
Miss Ye!

00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:41.599
Miss Ye!

00:25:00.519 --> 00:25:01.839
Do not panic, await our rescue!

00:25:03.279 --> 00:25:04.680
Do not panic, await our rescue!

00:25:06.559 --> 00:25:07.839
Do not panic!

00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.160
Do not panic!

00:25:12.559 --> 00:25:13.960
Await our rescue!

00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:20.599
This is Fukuda.

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.480
Coastal Defense Unit, urgent situation.

00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.680
Reporting to Captain Inoue of the Police Corps.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:26.519
A spy has been discovered on the Amemaru.

00:26:10.359 --> 00:26:10.920
Please wait.

00:26:48.559 --> 00:26:49.680
He is Sasaki.

00:26:49.759 --> 00:26:51.160
He's a squadron leader in the Police Corps.

00:26:53.599 --> 00:26:54.880
That's your luggage, right?

00:26:55.519 --> 00:26:56.920
He's not waiting for you, is he?

00:26:58.359 --> 00:26:59.279
I don't know.

00:26:59.279 --> 00:27:00.440
Give me your gun.

00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:01.400
After you're safe,

00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:02.480
I'll give it back to you.

00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:07.200
Hurry up.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.279
Thank you.

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:15.359
Thank you.

00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:32.599
Mr. Sasaki, hello.

00:27:33.039 --> 00:27:34.440
The interpreter is on the boat too.

00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:35.759
Last night was rough, huh?

00:27:37.079 --> 00:27:37.559
Yes.

00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:42.559
Is she Miss Ye?

00:27:44.519 --> 00:27:46.279
He's asking if you are Miss Ye.

00:27:47.680 --> 00:27:49.039
Come with us.

00:28:09.279 --> 00:28:10.039
Colonel.

00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.680
I'm responsible for taking you to the airport.

00:28:13.279 --> 00:28:14.000
Please.

00:28:24.880 --> 00:28:26.640
Attention, fellow villagers!

00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:29.160
The Special Police Corps decrees:

00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:31.720
Anyone who discovers a US pilot

00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:34.359
must report to the Police Corps.

00:28:34.880 --> 00:28:36.880
The Police Corps will reward you with

00:28:37.319 --> 00:28:39.599
50 jin of rice, 20 jin of pork.

00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:42.279
Everyone, pay attention!

00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:45.000
The Special Police Corps decrees:

00:28:45.359 --> 00:28:47.640
Anyone who discovers a US pilot

00:28:48.079 --> 00:28:50.359
must report to the Police Corps.

00:28:50.359 --> 00:28:52.200
The Police Corps will reward you with

00:28:52.200 --> 00:28:54.559
50 jin of rice, 20 jin of pork.

00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.920
Anyone who withholds information

00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:58.279
will be executed without mercy.

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:01.359
You in the back, move forward a bit.

00:29:01.359 --> 00:29:02.799
Come here.

00:29:02.799 --> 00:29:03.359
Come on, take a look.

00:29:03.359 --> 00:29:04.119
Listen to what they have to say.

00:29:04.119 --> 00:29:05.119
Mm-hmm, okay.

00:29:06.559 --> 00:29:07.440
Quiet!

00:29:07.440 --> 00:29:08.440
Let me explain.

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:10.319
For informants,

00:29:10.519 --> 00:29:13.279
50 jin of rice, 20 jin of pork.

00:29:14.319 --> 00:29:15.960
And for withholding information?

00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:16.559
What was it again?

00:29:16.559 --> 00:29:17.119
Speak!

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:18.680
The whole family gets shot.

00:29:19.279 --> 00:29:20.000
Shot.

00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:24.279
Everyone, pay attention!

00:29:24.279 --> 00:29:26.519
If you find a US pilot,

00:29:26.519 --> 00:29:29.440
you must report to the Police Corps.

00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:34.440
Sipo.

00:29:35.359 --> 00:29:36.559
Is Degong in?

00:29:37.559 --> 00:29:39.240
Oh, it's Chairman Tang.

00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:42.440
Aren't you busy serving your Japanese masters?

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.599
What are you doing here?

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.359
I'm asking you,

00:29:45.359 --> 00:29:46.720
is Degong in or not?

00:29:47.079 --> 00:29:47.839
What is it?

00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:48.519
No.

00:29:49.599 --> 00:29:50.079
This...

00:29:50.799 --> 00:29:51.559
Let me in.

00:29:51.559 --> 00:29:52.319
I have important business.

00:29:52.319 --> 00:29:52.960
Don't.

00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:53.680
Oh, for goodness' sake.

00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:54.240
Don't come in.

00:29:54.240 --> 00:29:54.799
Sipo.

00:29:54.799 --> 00:29:55.680
Let's sweep later.

00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:57.400
I really need to see Degong.

00:29:57.400 --> 00:29:58.640
It's a big matter!

00:29:58.839 --> 00:29:59.359
Sipo.

00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:00.640
Master.

00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:01.240
Degong!

00:30:02.279 --> 00:30:03.160
Chairman Tang.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:04.240
What is it?

00:30:06.119 --> 00:30:07.279
The Police Corps...

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:09.960
The Japanese said

00:30:10.319 --> 00:30:11.440
that on our island,

00:30:11.799 --> 00:30:12.839
an American has arrived.

00:30:13.559 --> 00:30:14.400
This American...

00:30:14.759 --> 00:30:15.880
What does that have to do with us?

00:30:16.799 --> 00:30:17.279
Exactly.

00:30:17.279 --> 00:30:18.960
What American or ugly American?

00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:19.480
Oh, darn.

00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:20.079
This American

00:30:20.079 --> 00:30:21.279
has nothing to do with our master.

00:30:21.279 --> 00:30:21.720
Go away.

00:30:21.720 --> 00:30:22.039
Oh, darn.

00:30:22.039 --> 00:30:23.519
Sipo, don't stop me.

00:30:23.519 --> 00:30:24.079
I really...

00:30:24.079 --> 00:30:25.640
We need to discuss this.

00:30:25.640 --> 00:30:26.920
You should leave.

00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:27.400
Oh, darn.

00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:28.079
Sipo.

00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:30.640
Let Chairman Tang in.

00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:34.880
Go on.

00:30:41.599 --> 00:30:42.119
Degong.

00:30:42.599 --> 00:30:44.279
There's something I need to tell you.

00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:45.240
Speak.

00:30:45.559 --> 00:30:46.000
What?

00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:47.920
I don't see Young Master Longxia.

00:30:50.039 --> 00:30:51.000
Chairman Tang, what is it?

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:51.519
Go ahead.

00:30:51.839 --> 00:30:52.240
Oh.

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:53.680
Yesterday,

00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.920
that Inoue from the Police Corps asked me

00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:58.519
if the wealthy families on the island

00:30:58.519 --> 00:31:00.279
all have secret rooms built.

00:31:02.319 --> 00:31:03.880
How do the Japanese know about this?

00:31:04.279 --> 00:31:06.200
I was wondering if it might be related to

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:07.440
that American who fell from the plane.

00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:09.039
That American.

00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:11.400
Did you tell them again?

00:31:12.119 --> 00:31:12.839
Degong,

00:31:13.359 --> 00:31:15.119
whether our house

00:31:15.119 --> 00:31:17.119
has a secret room or not, I don't know.

00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:18.559
I was thinking,

00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:19.799
could you move those

00:31:19.799 --> 00:31:22.079
valuables and jewelry to another place?

00:31:22.079 --> 00:31:23.839
Bury them somewhere in the backyard.

00:31:24.599 --> 00:31:25.440
This Inoue

00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.319
is not someone to be trifled with.

00:31:27.319 --> 00:31:28.720
We need to be on guard.

00:31:31.279 --> 00:31:31.960
I know.

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:32.480
Thank you.

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:32.960
Alright.

00:31:33.279 --> 00:31:34.200
Then I'll take my leave.

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:49.720
Fourth Aunt

00:31:50.079 --> 00:31:50.960
Yes?

00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:53.400
Tell Xia'er to come to the study.

00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:55.079
Yes, Master.

00:31:59.839 --> 00:32:01.240
Your Excellency, Commander.

00:32:01.759 --> 00:32:02.920
I, Degong, am old.

00:32:03.559 --> 00:32:05.000
A raised hand brings spring,

00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.799
a lowered hand brings autumn.

00:32:07.519 --> 00:32:09.319
I have returned to my hometown and fields,

00:32:09.319 --> 00:32:11.279
to tend solely to my beloved wife's grave,

00:32:11.279 --> 00:32:12.799
and quietly live out my remaining years.

00:32:12.839 --> 00:32:15.400
Recently, your soldiers have been searching and disturbing,

00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:16.599
causing me unbearable worry.

00:32:16.599 --> 00:32:17.680
Confucius said,

00:32:18.319 --> 00:32:21.279
"He who commands troops may become a ruler of men,

00:32:21.279 --> 00:32:23.440
but he sees all living things as maggots beneath his feet."

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.599
Meaning,

00:32:24.799 --> 00:32:27.799
"One who possesses an army may become a sovereign,

00:32:27.799 --> 00:32:29.240
but they regard the common people

00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:32.160
as insignificant as insects."

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.319
Confucius also said,

00:32:33.319 --> 00:32:35.839
"To govern the people, binding their spirit is the superior way.

00:32:35.839 --> 00:32:37.599
Imprisoning their body is a last resort.

00:32:37.599 --> 00:32:39.839
Destroying their body is the inferior way."

00:32:39.839 --> 00:32:41.720
I, an old man, have washed away the leaden dust of time.

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.200
I cannot bear to leave my hometown,

00:32:43.200 --> 00:32:44.519
and only ask not to be disturbed,

00:32:44.519 --> 00:32:45.920
to live out my life in quiet simplicity.

00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:47.720
Ye Degong.

00:32:49.839 --> 00:32:51.200
Father, you wanted to see me?

00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.079
Tang Bingchen just came and told me

00:32:56.079 --> 00:32:57.680
the Japanese are asking him

00:32:58.279 --> 00:33:00.119
about wealthy families on the island building secret rooms.

00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.720
Who ratted us out to the Japs?

00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.839
It might not be someone informing.

00:33:05.759 --> 00:33:06.960
Wealthy families building secret rooms

00:33:07.319 --> 00:33:08.759
is a local custom.

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:11.599
Then we must quickly

00:33:11.599 --> 00:33:13.000
hide the Major somewhere else.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:16.920
The Japs don't know yet

00:33:17.640 --> 00:33:19.240
the exact location of this secret room.

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:22.359
They're making noise on the island to create pressure,

00:33:22.359 --> 00:33:24.519
just to try and flush the Major out,

00:33:24.519 --> 00:33:25.519
to walk right into their trap.

00:33:26.039 --> 00:33:27.599
But if they really go all out,

00:33:27.599 --> 00:33:29.079
searching every house, digging three feet deep,

00:33:29.119 --> 00:33:30.400
we won't be able to hide forever.

00:33:32.519 --> 00:33:34.200
I've written a letter to Fujita here.

00:33:34.559 --> 00:33:35.480
Take it over immediately.

00:33:35.480 --> 00:33:37.160
It might buy us a day or two.

00:33:37.880 --> 00:33:39.240
What do we do next?

00:33:39.839 --> 00:33:41.039
I'll think of another way.

00:33:41.039 --> 00:33:41.640
Alright.

00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:42.480
I'll go now.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:00.440
Mr. Ye!

00:34:01.039 --> 00:34:02.039
Mr. Ye!

00:34:02.759 --> 00:34:03.279
Who is it?

00:34:03.279 --> 00:34:03.960
Fourth Aunt!

00:34:04.200 --> 00:34:04.839
Is Mr. Ye in?

00:34:04.839 --> 00:34:05.839
I need to see him urgently!

00:34:05.839 --> 00:34:06.759
Oh, Interpreter Luo.

00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:07.599
What is it?

00:34:07.599 --> 00:34:08.799
It's urgent, please hurry!

00:34:08.799 --> 00:34:09.359
Alright.

00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.279
Master.

00:34:27.839 --> 00:34:29.599
Interpreter Luo, what's the matter?

00:34:29.599 --> 00:34:30.319
Mr. Ye.

00:34:30.839 --> 00:34:32.680
Your daughter has been arrested by the Special Police Corps.

00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:33.839
What are you talking about, kid?

00:34:33.839 --> 00:34:35.119
My sister left the island long ago.

00:34:35.680 --> 00:34:36.119
No.

00:34:36.799 --> 00:34:38.440
Have you seen my daughter?

00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:39.680
By the time you arrived,

00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:41.400
my daughter was already off the island.

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:42.160
I'm not mistaken.

00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:44.319
She returned on the same boat as me.

00:34:44.319 --> 00:34:45.200
As soon as we disembarked,

00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:47.000
she was arrested by the Special Police Corps.

00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.440
Why would the Special Police Corps arrest her?

00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:49.559
She...

00:34:50.599 --> 00:34:51.880
Anyway, it's true.

00:34:52.200 --> 00:34:53.680
As for me, I must return to headquarters.

00:34:53.799 --> 00:34:54.960
I can't stay long.

00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.720
You should hurry and think of a solution.

00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:57.640
Hurry!

00:34:59.119 --> 00:34:59.920
Don't bother seeing me out.

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:02.759
Father.

00:35:03.599 --> 00:35:05.519
Only Japanese can enter or leave this island.

00:35:05.519 --> 00:35:06.799
How could Ying'er have come back?

00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:09.000
What do you think is going on?

00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:10.319
I think it's definitely this guy

00:35:10.319 --> 00:35:11.880
playing tricks with the Japanese.

00:35:11.880 --> 00:35:13.319
I'll go find him and get to the bottom of this.

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:16.680
Don't be so impulsive.

00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:17.960
Take this.

00:35:18.799 --> 00:35:19.640
I'll go and see.

00:35:25.279 --> 00:35:26.680
You will confess truthfully.

00:35:27.599 --> 00:35:29.119
Your real name.

00:35:29.119 --> 00:35:30.079
Occupation.

00:35:30.079 --> 00:35:31.440
Mission.

00:35:33.119 --> 00:35:34.480
Starting with your name.

00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:35.920
Name.

00:35:36.279 --> 00:35:37.160
Position.

00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.440
Mission.

00:35:47.199 --> 00:35:48.719
This bag is yours, correct?

00:35:49.519 --> 00:35:51.639
This is your leather bag.

00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:57.239
Someone!

00:35:57.239 --> 00:35:57.880
Yes!

00:35:58.519 --> 00:36:00.760
Have Shanghai investigate this.

00:36:00.760 --> 00:36:03.280
Document number 4906.

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:05.360
Who obtained for this woman

00:36:05.360 --> 00:36:06.760
this special pass to enter the island?

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:07.599
Yes, sir.

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.320
Is this your gun?

00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.320
This is your gun.

00:36:25.800 --> 00:36:27.719
I won't ask a second time.

00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:30.960
Let me tell you again.

00:36:31.199 --> 00:36:35.400
Is this your bag and gun?

00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:37.880
This is your gun, your bag.

00:36:39.199 --> 00:36:41.000
How did you get to this island?

00:36:41.360 --> 00:36:43.840
And who gave you the special pass?

00:36:44.239 --> 00:36:45.199
How did you get it?

00:36:45.679 --> 00:36:46.119
The permit.

00:36:46.119 --> 00:36:47.960
First, find a hot-tempered officer.

00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:49.079
He'll hit you.

00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:49.880
Curse at you.

00:36:50.239 --> 00:36:50.719
Threaten you.

00:36:51.360 --> 00:36:52.960
Make you feel extreme psychological fear.

00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:56.679
Your gun.

00:36:57.159 --> 00:36:58.079
Take it.

00:36:58.599 --> 00:36:59.840
Hold it, quick!

00:37:00.519 --> 00:37:01.880
This gun is yours, right?

00:37:05.199 --> 00:37:07.719
This gun is yours, isn't it?

00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:10.440
This gun is definitely yours.

00:37:10.639 --> 00:37:11.239
Hold on.

00:37:11.719 --> 00:37:12.960
Remember to stay silent.

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:15.199
I only arrived on the island five hours after you.

00:37:18.679 --> 00:37:19.280
Captain.

00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:22.840
What are you doing?

00:37:23.320 --> 00:37:23.800
Captain!

00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:26.079
That woman is Ye Degong's daughter.

00:37:29.199 --> 00:37:30.039
I see.

00:37:32.199 --> 00:37:35.159
So she's Ye Degong's daughter.

00:37:35.159 --> 00:37:36.960
She's not from this island.

00:37:38.119 --> 00:37:38.639
Yes.

00:37:39.280 --> 00:37:41.239
That old man and his servant are both outside the door.

00:37:45.519 --> 00:37:47.559
Arrest him first.

00:37:47.559 --> 00:37:48.639
Let Sasaki handle it.

00:37:48.639 --> 00:37:49.360
No need.

00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:51.480
Call Sasaki over.

00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:52.639
Yes, sir.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:37:59.320
Are you still not going to talk?!

00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.079
Squadron Leader.

00:38:11.119 --> 00:38:11.960
The opportunity has come.

00:38:12.679 --> 00:38:15.000
You don't need to handle things here anymore.

00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.360
Go immediately to Ye Degong's house in Tanjiawan.

00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:17.679
Dig out the secret room.

00:38:18.360 --> 00:38:18.880
Understood.

00:38:31.159 --> 00:38:33.400
Move aside.

00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:39.639
Colonel.

00:38:41.239 --> 00:38:42.119
A word in private.

00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:49.840
Look at this.

00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:53.280
Your female assistant has been arrested.

00:38:53.599 --> 00:38:56.159
It's a call from the Sanzao Island Special Police Corps.

00:38:56.519 --> 00:38:57.239
It seems they found something.

00:38:57.239 --> 00:38:58.360
Her special pass.

00:39:00.119 --> 00:39:01.239
Something must have gone wrong.

00:39:02.599 --> 00:39:03.519
Listen to me.

00:39:03.719 --> 00:39:04.800
The operation is canceled.

00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:07.320
Calm down.

00:39:08.079 --> 00:39:09.000
You must stay calm.

00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.880
It will be dangerous.

00:39:11.679 --> 00:39:12.440
What else are they investigating?

00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:14.039
Nothing else for now.

00:39:15.360 --> 00:39:15.960
Let me think.

00:39:18.440 --> 00:39:19.360
This telegram arriving here...

00:39:20.119 --> 00:39:20.880
...proves she has been arrested...

00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:22.039
...for over two hours.

00:39:22.679 --> 00:39:23.039
If I take a plane...

00:39:23.039 --> 00:39:24.400
...it will still take two more hours.

00:39:31.679 --> 00:39:32.159
I'm leaving.

00:39:33.679 --> 00:39:34.239
No.

00:39:51.599 --> 00:39:52.679
Along the way...

00:39:52.679 --> 00:39:54.199
...Takeki was reviewing...

00:39:54.199 --> 00:39:57.280
...all his activities with Ye Biying in Shanghai.

00:39:57.679 --> 00:39:59.320
Reviewing with Ye Biying...

00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.840
...every step of the island entry procedure.

00:40:01.840 --> 00:40:04.039
Reviewing every detail that could lead to...

00:40:04.039 --> 00:40:06.320
...exposure of their identities.

00:40:06.639 --> 00:40:08.280
Takeki carefully reviewed...

00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.199
...all the activities in Shanghai.

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:12.360
From this, he drew an inference.

00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.039
Ye Biying's arrest...

00:40:14.039 --> 00:40:15.679
...should be an accident.

00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000
Let's change locations.

00:41:02.159 --> 00:41:02.880
Captain.

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:03.679
Hmm?

00:41:04.679 --> 00:41:05.599
The officer who processed Ye Biying's...

00:41:05.599 --> 00:41:06.639
...special pass for island entry...

00:41:06.639 --> 00:41:08.000
...was a colonel.

00:41:10.599 --> 00:41:11.880
The Shanghai Garrison Intelligence Section...

00:41:11.880 --> 00:41:12.559
...has already classified these materials...

00:41:12.559 --> 00:41:13.760
...as confidential.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:14.400
Therefore...

00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:17.039
...a routine investigation would find it hard to get results.

00:41:17.039 --> 00:41:18.480
Unless it has Commander Fujita's signature.

00:41:19.440 --> 00:41:22.039
What the hell? So troublesome.

00:41:22.039 --> 00:41:23.880
That stubborn old man.

00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:25.599
What the hell is this?

00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:27.239
We can use this.

00:41:27.360 --> 00:41:29.199
The father of the woman just detained.

00:41:29.199 --> 00:41:31.400
But don't use torture.

00:41:31.519 --> 00:41:31.920
Understood.

00:41:51.119 --> 00:41:51.800
How is it going?

00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:52.840
Too impulsive, you fool!

00:41:54.079 --> 00:41:56.639
You saw that woman's reaction, right?

00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:00.400
See how she held her breath...

00:42:00.679 --> 00:42:02.400
...even stopped breathing.

00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:04.199
What does this mean?

00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:07.400
This is humanity's instinct since ancient times.

00:42:07.400 --> 00:42:09.480
When wanting to conceal or hide something...

00:42:09.480 --> 00:42:10.760
...this is the reaction.

00:42:10.760 --> 00:42:12.199
When humans are unable to fight back...

00:42:12.199 --> 00:42:14.840
...and resist...

00:42:14.840 --> 00:42:20.440
...they think of hiding.

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:22.880
That's why she had this reaction.

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:23.960
In other words...

00:42:23.960 --> 00:42:25.880
...she is under immense pressure.

00:42:26.199 --> 00:42:27.719
Now we just wait for her...

00:42:27.719 --> 00:42:29.920
...psychological defenses to crumble.
