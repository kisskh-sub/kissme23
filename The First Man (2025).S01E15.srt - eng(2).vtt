00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:03.170
(Episode 15)

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:04.280
What's going on?

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:06.440
The banner's gone again?

00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:09.180
Yes. I'm positive about this now.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.150
I'm positive it's the work of the jerks
who did that to your mother.

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:16.150
Look. See how it's been torn?

00:00:16.450 --> 00:00:18.590
It disappeared overnight,

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.760
so a friend I know in Taean
asked the county office.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:24.730
- And?
- They said it wasn't the county workers.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:25.760
Then who did?

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.170
So that means the culprit...

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.240
Then it really must have been the culprit.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:46.120
Chae Hwa Young has some nerve,
trying to one-up me?

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.550
How dare she slap me!

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.860
It's a good thing
the Chairman walked in when he did,

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.630
or your face would've been a mess.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:54.990
You know I have good hearing, right?

00:00:56.590 --> 00:00:59.660
It sounded exactly like
the Chairman's footsteps.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.640
So I deliberately yelled,
just so the Chairman would hear me.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.140
"Love?"

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:10.240
Did you just say "love"
with that filthy mouth of yours?

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:12.740
Say it again. I dare you.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:14.710
You "love" the Chairman?

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:17.680
That's right. Love.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:19.920
I love the Chairman!

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:23.090
Love, my foot.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.290
I guess all my hard work
is finally paying off.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:36.070
Since the Chairman said
I don't have to go to India,

00:01:36.940 --> 00:01:40.510
he won't leave me
as an assistant manager, right, Mom?

00:01:40.570 --> 00:01:41.570
Of course not.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:45.040
At the very least, a director,

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:49.710
or maybe he might even make you
an executive.

00:01:51.550 --> 00:01:56.190
Chae Hwa Young tried to mess with us,
but it looks like it backfired on her.

00:01:58.660 --> 00:02:01.890
Can't you just picture Chae Hwa Young
freaking out right now?

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.160
Talk about shooting yourself in the foot.

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:14.470
Dad, maybe the culprit is
still living around Taean.

00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:16.110
Yes, that's possible.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.110
They're connected to your mom's accident,

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.650
so a guilty conscience must be why
they took down the banner.

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:26.620
You're right. That must be it.

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.090
What should we do?
Since we have to catch him,

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:31.190
should we put the banner back up?

00:02:33.420 --> 00:02:35.430
Dad, how about this?

00:02:36.460 --> 00:02:38.260
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:40.970
It feels like everything
is finally falling into place.

00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:44.870
The banner, the transfer of Jin Hong Ju...

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:48.210
Yes. And the Chairman...

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:51.480
is starting to have a hard time
going against you.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:53.280
Obviously.

00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.750
He's been clinging to power
so tenaciously.

00:02:58.050 --> 00:02:59.380
The thing about power is,

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.850
once you get a taste of it,
it's very hard to let go.

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.930
That old man should have made
his exit by now,

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:10.760
but he just can't let it go.

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:16.000
I'm trying my best to spin off
and run one of the hotels under the group,

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.370
but that old fool, Chairman Ma,
has it in a death grip...

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:20.200
and refuses to let go.

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:21.940
Someday, you'll be able...

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.280
to take over all of Dream Group,
not just the hotel.

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:27.080
When?

00:03:27.580 --> 00:03:28.980
It's already been decades.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:33.620
I've worked day and night
for one thing and one thing only,

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:35.120
making the entire Dream Group mine.

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:39.220
But that old fool, Chairman Ma,
is still hanging on...

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.030
and meddling in my affairs.

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.300
When on earth will I finally get
the entire Dream Group?

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.870
- Tell me.
- Don't worry. It won't be long now.

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:52.500
The Chairman has a bad heart, you know.

00:03:54.010 --> 00:03:55.210
What's Dr. Kim's take on it?

00:03:55.740 --> 00:03:58.410
He sent the Chairman's echocardiogram
to a doctor at Johns Hopkins,

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:00.580
a Dr. Malone.

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:01.680
He did?

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.220
So he's getting a second opinion
from Dr. Malone?

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:06.320
Yes.

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:17.030
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.930
Right. Before you go to India,
make sure you hand over all your duties.

00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.500
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.640
What's this?

00:04:27.210 --> 00:04:28.840
- You're resigning?
- Yes.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:31.710
I will not be going to India.

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:34.180
Then...

00:04:34.550 --> 00:04:36.410
Are you saying you'll leave Dream Hotel...

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:38.650
to be unemployed and live with your mom?

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:42.190
Whether I end up jobless
or get a job at another company,

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:44.890
I don't know yet.

00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.190
Fine. Good for you.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:51.030
Still, it's a shame.

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.170
Our company has invested so much in you.

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.870
To think you'd just leave
without giving anything back.

00:04:57.740 --> 00:04:58.770
I'm not sure about that.

00:04:59.270 --> 00:05:01.440
We'll have to see...

00:05:02.270 --> 00:05:03.510
whether I'm gone for good or not.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.240
What?

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.910
You want me to resign?

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.050
That's right.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:11.920
It's best if you resign from Dream Hotel.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.020
Chairman,

00:05:13.380 --> 00:05:14.820
are you saying...

00:05:15.350 --> 00:05:18.460
you're kicking Hong Ju
out of Dream Hotel completely?

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.230
Hong Ju, let's just go to India.

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:22.990
We can't have you be unemployed.

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:25.130
What are you talking about? Unemployed?

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:29.270
Then what's she supposed to do
if she resigns?

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.040
Just be patient.

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:33.640
Have I ever had to say something twice?

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.540
What?

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:48.250
Please process my resignation
as soon as possible, ma'am.

00:05:48.820 --> 00:05:49.820
Goodbye.

00:05:49.890 --> 00:05:51.820
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:02.500
What do you think this means?

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:04.540
Judging by
Assistant Manager Jin's attitude,

00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:06.540
I have a bad feeling about this.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:08.540
Right?

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:13.210
Do you think that old geezer, Chairman Ma,
is behind this?

00:06:14.650 --> 00:06:15.710
What could it be?

00:06:17.950 --> 00:06:20.320
What? You really quit?

00:06:20.820 --> 00:06:24.460
Yes. That's why I came to say goodbye.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:28.960
What are you doing?
This isn't like you, Jin Hong Ju.

00:06:29.930 --> 00:06:33.630
You're giving up all your hard work
over a transfer to India?

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:36.100
I'm sorry.

00:06:36.630 --> 00:06:38.440
After I worked so hard to bring you here,

00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:40.440
I can't even give you
the support you need.

00:06:41.910 --> 00:06:42.910
Knock, knock.

00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:47.680
Assistant Manager Jin!

00:06:48.250 --> 00:06:51.980
If you're going to resign,
you should report to me, your supervisor.

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:53.920
Why are you reporting to Chef Kang?

00:06:57.590 --> 00:06:59.520
I guess I won't be seeing you around,
Director Ma.

00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:01.260
Let's just part on good terms.

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.030
Thanks for everything.

00:07:04.260 --> 00:07:07.200
For a "thank you,"
that was pretty hostile.

00:07:08.570 --> 00:07:09.570
Really?

00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:14.140
Even if you've quit Dream Hotel,
I'll still pay your salary.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:16.770
You can keep carrying my bags,
driving my car,

00:07:16.840 --> 00:07:18.780
and holding my dresses for me.

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:19.880
Like my personal maid.

00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:23.150
How much do you want?

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:25.050
Director Ma.

00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:27.320
That's way out of line.

00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:29.220
What? Me?

00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:31.160
What did I say that was out of line?

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.360
I was only saying that for her own good.

00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.790
Is it okay to humiliate and belittle
someone like that?

00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.200
My goodness, why are you getting so angry?

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:39.600
Is this something to get angry about?

00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.170
You tell me, Assistant Manager Jin.

00:07:42.630 --> 00:07:44.140
Were you offended by what I said?

00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:46.570
Ma Seo Rin, you listen to me.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:51.040
I'm not your little gofer
who cleans up after you anymore.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.180
I've quit Dream Hotel.

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.580
You're not my boss or anything to me.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:07:56.950
Got it?

00:07:59.220 --> 00:08:02.020
Fine. Okay, then.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:04.520
There. Are you happy now?

00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:07.860
I was just making a suggestion.
Why is everyone so angry?

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:10.190
I just don't get it at all.

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.910
Chef Kang Jun Ho,
CEO Chae is looking for you.

00:08:35.920 --> 00:08:36.920
Look at this.

00:08:37.420 --> 00:08:40.190
Truffles, caviar,
foie gras, pine mushrooms,

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:44.300
six-year-old ginseng,
lobster flown in by air...

00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:47.370
What is this? Will these ingredients
be gold flakes or something?

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.830
Are you running a restaurant
or serving a royal banquet?

00:08:51.440 --> 00:08:53.040
I thought I told you to cut costs.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.210
You can't make great food
without great ingredients.

00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:58.110
I bought them because they're essential.

00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.210
Exactly.

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:02.350
Making food delicious and presentable
without the best ingredients...

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:04.150
is what a chef of your caliber
should be doing.

00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:06.520
Anyone can make great food with these.

00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:08.820
You're hardly a chef if you can't, right?

00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:12.960
I think...

00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:16.530
you're severely underestimating
the fine dining industry.

00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:18.730
Our customers have
very discerning palates.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:21.700
You should know it only takes a second
to lose them for good.

00:09:23.700 --> 00:09:24.900
You're that confident?

00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:27.370
Confident that you can turn a profit,
I mean.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:30.740
That's enough.

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.840
Why do you have to question my every move
like this every single day?

00:09:33.910 --> 00:09:35.680
I'm not questioning your every move.

00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.920
I'm speaking as the one responsible
for this hotel's bottom line.

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.990
If you keep blowing money on ingredients
and fail to increase sales,

00:09:42.050 --> 00:09:44.020
I trust you're prepared to resign
immediately.

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:48.690
Because if the hotel's profits drop,
this restaurant will be the first I cut.

00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.360
- So you'd better be ready.
- Am I supposed to worry about...

00:09:52.530 --> 00:09:55.200
not just the restaurant
but the entire hotel's profitability now?

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:59.970
Isn't that something you, the CEO,
should be worrying about?

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:03.140
So you're refusing to cut costs?

00:10:03.210 --> 00:10:04.640
If I cut costs on ingredients,

00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:08.050
there's no way I can double our revenue
in two months.

00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:11.720
And if you keep interfering
with my work like this,

00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.190
I might just have to report you
for obstruction of business.

00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:18.060
I'm not a very patient man.

00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:20.620
So please, stop testing me.

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:31.370
That arrogant punk.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:34.110
I didn't even dismiss him,
and he just walked out.

00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.040
Fine, Kang Jun Ho.

00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:40.280
You'll be out of here soon enough anyway.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:43.610
Like he has any way of doubling the sales.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:48.190
I'm back.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:53.390
So, how did it go?

00:10:55.130 --> 00:10:57.090
About the health department...

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:05.240
- We got approval!
- Really? That's great!

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:08.170
Does this mean we can start
our lunch box delivery service now?

00:11:08.410 --> 00:11:10.440
Of course we can. Absolutely.

00:11:11.710 --> 00:11:13.880
You sound like you approved it yourself,
Kang Baek Ho.

00:11:13.940 --> 00:11:16.950
- I did work hard for it.
- Come on, Jang Mi.

00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:19.380
- Thank you, Lawyer Kang.
- You're welcome.

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:21.620
We ran around all day and haven't eaten.
Feed us.

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:23.290
Gosh, all that work made me hungry.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:27.060
Okay, just a minute.
I'll bring out some rice and side dishes.

00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:28.130
Okay.

00:11:30.630 --> 00:11:32.400
I made japchae, Kang Baek Ho.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.270
I made your favorite dish
extra delicious for you.

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:37.540
- Japchae!
- Hey! Stop!

00:11:37.870 --> 00:11:40.740
Kang Baek Ho, business is still business.

00:11:41.510 --> 00:11:44.010
- Pardon?
- You're making a huge deal...

00:11:44.010 --> 00:11:45.410
out of helping my family...

00:11:45.480 --> 00:11:48.450
and trying to use it to sweep
your past mistakes under the rug.

00:11:48.550 --> 00:11:50.380
- Again?
- What's going on with you two?

00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:52.280
I feel like I'm missing something here.

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:54.550
So does this mean I can't have any?

00:11:55.690 --> 00:11:58.490
Baek Ho, go ahead and eat. I like you.

00:11:58.690 --> 00:12:02.030
He even bought me juice.
Baek Ho loves japchae.

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:03.660
You're the best!

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:05.300
Let's eat.

00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:16.540
We need to talk after you're done eating.

00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:25.280
So, I'm trying to catch the person
who did this to my mom.

00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:29.550
So you're saying you think
the culprit took down the banner?

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:33.620
Yes. So this time,
I'm going to put up the banner again,

00:12:34.090 --> 00:12:36.190
but I'll also install
a hidden camera nearby...

00:12:36.590 --> 00:12:39.160
to try and film whoever takes it down.

00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:40.300
What do you think?

00:12:40.430 --> 00:12:43.070
But that's illegal,
so it won't be admissible as evidence.

00:12:43.470 --> 00:12:44.600
Right.

00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:47.810
That's actually why
I wanted to talk to you.

00:12:48.210 --> 00:12:49.910
Do you have any better ideas?

00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:51.280
Let me think.

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:55.150
By the way, is your hand all better now?

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.580
Yes.

00:12:57.850 --> 00:13:00.120
But that doesn't mean I've forgiven you.

00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:02.590
You really know how to hold a grudge.

00:13:03.590 --> 00:13:05.320
- What was that?
- Look, let's be honest.

00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.660
What did I do that was so awful?

00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:11.300
At home, you're constantly
holding it over my head,

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.730
ready to tell everyone
it was all my fault.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.330
Are you for real?

00:13:14.730 --> 00:13:17.670
- So it was okay that you hurt my hand?
- Well, that...

00:13:18.470 --> 00:13:20.300
Okay, I admit I was wrong.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:22.740
But we were both at fault at the start.

00:13:22.910 --> 00:13:26.310
No, wait. It all started because
you took my shopping bag.

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:29.250
No, scratch that. I hailed the cab first,

00:13:29.410 --> 00:13:31.720
but you stubbornly insisted
that you got it first.

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:34.750
Gosh, you are unbelievable.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.690
You've been so good to my brother,
and I owe you a lot,

00:13:39.020 --> 00:13:42.130
so I was going to be the bigger person
and let it go.

00:13:42.460 --> 00:13:44.500
But you're so stubborn
and don't even know what you did wrong.

00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:46.930
Come on. Let's not do this.

00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.370
You're milking this for all it's worth.

00:13:49.770 --> 00:13:52.100
What? Kang Baek Ho!

00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:55.270
So that's how you want to play this?

00:13:56.070 --> 00:13:58.640
Fine. I'm telling my brother and my dad...

00:13:58.710 --> 00:14:01.080
all about your horrible deeds.

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.650
They swore they'd make
the one responsible for my hand pay...

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:04.820
if they ever found him.

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.250
- So you'd better be ready.
- Give me a break!

00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:09.650
It's your fault
I had to give up on my dream!

00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:13.190
My dream was to be an apprentice
to Chef Kang Jun Ho at the Dream Hotel,

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:15.790
but I couldn't even get the job
because you hurt my hand.

00:14:16.690 --> 00:14:18.060
You still have the nerve
to say you're innocent?

00:14:23.670 --> 00:14:25.270
Okay, I'm sorry, all right?

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:34.850
It's been so long
since we all had a meal together.

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:37.510
You're right.

00:14:37.510 --> 00:14:40.750
Let's have breakfast from now on. Okay?

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:44.460
- Sounds great.
- I'll cut down on morning market trips.

00:14:44.590 --> 00:14:47.190
Jun Ho, you must be exhausted.
How do you manage?

00:14:47.390 --> 00:14:50.060
Even with all your hard work,
you said the CEO of Dream Hotel...

00:14:50.260 --> 00:14:53.000
would decide after seeing your sales
for two months, right?

00:14:53.360 --> 00:14:56.270
What good is a pretty face
with a rotten personality like that?

00:14:56.330 --> 00:14:59.500
When she's running a hotel that big,

00:14:59.570 --> 00:15:01.610
I'm sure she has her reasons.

00:15:02.070 --> 00:15:03.770
Reasons? Please.

00:15:04.240 --> 00:15:07.710
- It's because she has it out for Jun Ho.
- Don't worry.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:10.110
CEO Chae isn't going to get her way.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:13.980
That's right. My son is very capable.

00:15:13.980 --> 00:15:15.090
Jun Ho.

00:15:15.950 --> 00:15:18.220
Is your restaurant hiring
any junior staff?

00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:19.820
You don't need any more people?

00:15:20.590 --> 00:15:21.860
Are you asking me for a job for someone?

00:15:22.890 --> 00:15:23.960
We're fully staffed.

00:15:25.360 --> 00:15:26.860
Talk about cold-hearted.

00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:34.240
I'm fine.

00:15:35.710 --> 00:15:36.710
Are you all right?

00:15:37.140 --> 00:15:38.140
I'm fine.

00:15:38.540 --> 00:15:39.610
What about Seo Rin?

00:15:39.610 --> 00:15:42.080
Is she still obsessed
with Chef Kang Jun Ho?

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:47.050
Meeting Maestro Cohen was
a huge opportunity,

00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:48.250
and she just blew it off.

00:15:48.590 --> 00:15:49.590
That girl is out of her mind.

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.760
Still, the fact that
all the philharmonic members...

00:15:52.090 --> 00:15:53.990
are staying at our hotel is a relief.

00:15:54.190 --> 00:15:57.260
That was only possible
because I went on and on...

00:15:57.330 --> 00:15:59.300
about my daughter being a violin major.

00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.370
If I had come all this way
and left empty-handed,

00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.040
how pathetic would I have looked?

00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:07.470
Hurry and bring the car around.

00:16:08.570 --> 00:16:09.570
Yes, ma'am.

00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.390
- Yes.
- We look forward to working with you.

00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:23.320
Thank you so much.

00:16:25.290 --> 00:16:26.490
What's taking him so long?

00:16:45.680 --> 00:16:46.980
CEO Chae, are you all right?

00:16:48.080 --> 00:16:49.110
Professor.

00:16:49.380 --> 00:16:51.150
Is your ankle okay?
You didn't hurt yourself, did you?

00:16:52.920 --> 00:16:53.920
Yes, I'm fine.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:57.520
It's easy to twist an ankle in high heels
if you're not careful.

00:16:58.290 --> 00:16:59.290
Tell me about it.

00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:01.730
What brings you here?

00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:06.600
I'm here on business.
The art center hired me for a design.

00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:10.070
I didn't realize the scope of your work
was so broad.

00:17:11.070 --> 00:17:13.740
It's nothing compared to what you do.

00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:17.340
If it weren't for you
I would've taken a nasty fall.

00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:19.640
How embarrassing would that have been?

00:17:20.980 --> 00:17:22.710
To thank you,
allow me to treat you to a meal.

00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:24.620
You haven't eaten yet, have you?

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:27.580
No, I haven't.

00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:50.970
It really seems like
you're under a lot of stress.

00:17:51.510 --> 00:17:54.140
That makes your whole body tense up.

00:17:55.980 --> 00:17:58.480
I usually work it off at the gym,

00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:00.950
but I was distracted
and missed a few days,

00:18:00.950 --> 00:18:02.320
so I guess it shows.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.120
So, is the meal to your liking?

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:08.960
Yes, it's excellent.

00:18:12.430 --> 00:18:15.870
Different countries have their own style
of eating steak.

00:18:15.970 --> 00:18:17.100
Different countries?

00:18:17.230 --> 00:18:21.270
Yes, in France, a lot of people
enjoy their steak blue rare,

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:24.370
which is barely cooked.

00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:28.310
In Japan, they slice it thinly
and eat it with a pinch of salt.

00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:33.180
In Argentina, they have asado,
slow-grilling meat over charcoal.

00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.950
It's a completely different vibe
from an American steak.

00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.320
What about you, Professor Kang?
What's your favorite style?

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:45.300
Seeing as you're having it medium rare,
I'd say you're quite the connoisseur.

00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.070
Well, I am related to the famous Kang...

00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:54.840
Should I tell her that Chef Kang Jun Ho
is my son?

00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:59.810
No, it could affect boosting saies.
I can't risk that.

00:19:00.340 --> 00:19:02.010
Pardon? The famous...

00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:06.780
I'm the professor with the great palate.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:07.950
People even call me
Professor Kang, the connoisseur.

00:19:09.690 --> 00:19:13.590
But how you eat it isn't what's important.

00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:17.590
It's who you're eating with that matters.

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:21.330
You're right. Who you eat with
is what's important.

00:19:22.300 --> 00:19:25.500
Just like how this is the best steak ever
because I'm with you.

00:19:30.610 --> 00:19:31.640
It's strange, isn't it?

00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:34.680
Maybe it's because we've bumped
into each other a few times,

00:19:35.250 --> 00:19:37.650
but it feels as if
we've been sharing meals together...

00:19:37.950 --> 00:19:40.380
every day for a very long time.
It's so comfortable and nice.

00:19:43.250 --> 00:19:44.960
I feel the same way.
Being with you, Hwa Young...

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:49.330
I mean, having a meal like this
with you, CEO Chae,

00:19:50.090 --> 00:19:51.930
has been a true pleasure.

00:19:52.730 --> 00:19:54.060
Professor Kang.

00:19:54.060 --> 00:19:57.230
Please, just call me Hwa Young.

00:19:58.070 --> 00:20:00.740
I'd like it if you called me by my name.

00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:14.280
These are concert tickets.

00:20:15.250 --> 00:20:16.250
CEO Chae...

00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:19.560
No, I mean...

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:22.230
Hwa Young, you seem to be
under a lot of stress.

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:25.530
There's nothing better for stress
than music.

00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.070
Go with someone special.

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:32.340
Someone special...

00:20:34.970 --> 00:20:36.540
I want to go with you.

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:38.140
What?

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:40.110
Then I'll see you there.

00:20:43.780 --> 00:20:44.780
Okay.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.920
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:20:53.920 --> 00:20:55.930
- Here you are.
- Thanks.

00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:59.100
We make these boxed lunches
with the care of a home-cooked meal.

00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:01.870
To celebrate our launch,
we're only offering them to our regulars,

00:21:01.930 --> 00:21:03.570
so please give it a try
and place an order.

00:21:03.630 --> 00:21:06.670
Give it a try and place an order.
We also deliver if you're busy.

00:21:06.740 --> 00:21:10.340
- Okay, will do.
- Great, thank you. Come again!

00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:16.110
Jang Mi, take this to Lawyer Kang.

00:21:16.850 --> 00:21:18.980
- What?
- He helped us out a lot.

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:21.620
Our boxed lunch service is thanks to him,

00:21:21.850 --> 00:21:23.790
so of course
we should give him one to try.

00:21:27.090 --> 00:21:30.330
(Law Firm Leeho)

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.300
Manager, about tomorrow's trial...

00:21:36.570 --> 00:21:39.100
Jang Mi? What are you doing here?

00:21:39.770 --> 00:21:41.910
We finally started selling
our boxed lunches.

00:21:42.470 --> 00:21:45.240
- My dad told me to bring this to you.
- Your father?

00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:48.050
He should have called.
I would have come to pick it up.

00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.910
But why did you bring so much?

00:21:51.280 --> 00:21:53.250
Try it and give me some feedback.

00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:55.520
You know, like whether
we should change the menu or not.

00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:59.220
Okay.
I'll be sure to give it a thorough review.

00:21:59.620 --> 00:22:02.490
By the way,
Tae Pyung's stage debut is tonight.

00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:04.490
You should come and cheer him on too.

00:22:04.560 --> 00:22:07.400
Of course I know. How could I not?
He's my brother.

00:22:08.630 --> 00:22:13.240
With a name that means rose,
it's no wonder you're so prickly.

00:22:13.370 --> 00:22:15.940
I suppose so. I wonder why that is.

00:22:16.410 --> 00:22:19.840
I'm perfectly sweet and kind
to everyone else,

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.980
but with you, Lawyer Kang Baek Ho,
I get prickly.

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:25.550
If you really have no idea
why I'm like that...

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:29.150
If I don't, then what?

00:22:29.620 --> 00:22:31.720
Why are you only so prickly with me?

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.690
For everything you've done to me,

00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:37.930
you still haven't shown
that you're truly, deeply sorry.

00:22:38.030 --> 00:22:40.560
How many more times do I have to apologize
for you to accept it?

00:22:41.230 --> 00:22:43.330
- You really hold a grudge.
- Excuse me?

00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.300
I thought we were even
since you hit me too.

00:22:47.470 --> 00:22:48.510
Aren't we even now?

00:22:48.510 --> 00:22:50.440
- They'll hear you.
- Hey! What are you doing?

00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:58.480
You almost ruined my chances
of having a family.

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:00.650
I've never met a woman that strong.

00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:04.420
What about your habit of covering my mouth
every time you get the chance?

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.260
My girlfriend is right here.

00:23:06.260 --> 00:23:09.760
- What? Wait. What are you even saying?
- Come here, honey.

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:26.110
If you do that one more time,
I swear I'll take this hand and...

00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:27.310
You'll what?

00:23:27.310 --> 00:23:28.910
What, you'll break it?

00:23:30.250 --> 00:23:31.280
Yes!

00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:44.590
Anyway, enjoy the food.
I'll see you in a bit.

00:23:51.970 --> 00:23:53.040
Why did she suddenly...

00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:55.140
get all up in my face like that?

00:23:58.380 --> 00:23:59.480
Why is it so hot in here?

00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:05.020
- It's Hwa Young.
- Hello, Hwa Young.

00:24:05.480 --> 00:24:08.850
Don't tell me you're calling to say
you can't make it to the concert.

00:24:10.190 --> 00:24:12.460
How could I possibly miss it
when I'm going with such great company?

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:16.090
Actually, I was wondering
if you were free this evening.

00:24:17.430 --> 00:24:19.930
The concert isn't for a few more days.

00:24:20.630 --> 00:24:23.000
Waiting until then to see you...

00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:25.670
is too long to wait.

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:51.130
Our Tae Pyung is a singer!
He's going to sing!

00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:54.400
Mom, when he starts singing,

00:24:54.870 --> 00:24:56.130
make sure you clap
really loud for him, okay?

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:57.930
I will. Don't worry.

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:00.770
- Break a leg, Tae Pyung!
- Thanks. Let's go.

00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:01.840
Let's go.

00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.270
A singer I back is
performing here tonight,

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:32.800
and he insisted that I come.

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:37.840
Let's just listen without him knowing.
Is that okay?

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:40.410
I'd love that.

00:25:51.450 --> 00:25:52.660
Here, drink this.

00:25:53.760 --> 00:25:57.160
Don't try too hard.
Just sing as you do in practice.

00:25:57.530 --> 00:25:58.930
Yes, I got it.

00:26:00.030 --> 00:26:01.060
Oh, right.

00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:02.900
I invited CEO Chae Hwa Young
to come watch,

00:26:03.570 --> 00:26:04.570
but I'm not sure if she'll actually come.

00:26:04.570 --> 00:26:06.640
Don't worry about that.

00:26:06.900 --> 00:26:09.570
Don't think about anything
and just focus on your song.

00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:11.110
Got it, Oh Tae Pyung?

00:26:11.810 --> 00:26:12.910
Break a leg.

00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.180
Okay. I got this!

00:26:16.410 --> 00:26:17.410
Alright.

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:43.840
What do you think? Fun, right?

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.510
Dad, I'm going to run to the restroom
before Tae Pyung starts singing.

00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:51.580
Okay.

00:27:01.790 --> 00:27:05.560
Maybe it's my age,
but I keep getting lost in old memories.

00:27:06.060 --> 00:27:08.470
I'm even starting to like oldies
and pop songs from back in the day.

00:27:10.030 --> 00:27:12.340
Hwa Young, don't be silly.
You're not getting old.

00:27:12.770 --> 00:27:16.310
You're still the same cover girl
from our school days.

00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:22.780
Going up.

00:27:22.850 --> 00:27:25.720
(That Night of Music and Memories)

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:28.120
(We invite you back to the good old days.)

00:28:14.630 --> 00:28:16.070
(The First Man)

00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.970
I've decided to spend the rest of my life
with Mrs. Yeom.

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.140
Father!

00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:23.370
I saw you with CEO Chae at the lounge bar.

00:28:23.370 --> 00:28:25.010
You two seemed pretty close.

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:27.980
- What's with that look?
- I want an explanation, Father.

00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:30.310
I miss you, Hwa Young.

00:28:30.380 --> 00:28:33.120
I couldn't sleep because I wanted to hear
your voice, Professor Kang.

00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:35.320
Mom, are you dating someone?

00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:41.320
