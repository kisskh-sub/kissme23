WEBVTT

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.159
Don't leave anyone behind.

00:03:52.599 --> 00:03:53.919
Right, make sure no one's left out.

00:03:57.639 --> 00:04:00.240
The new shop's renovation really looks the part.

00:04:00.639 --> 00:04:01.319
Here.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.520
Morning.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:03.199
Bro.

00:04:09.199 --> 00:04:10.120
Where's Ma Weiguo?

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.520
He hasn't arrived.

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.039
You should've called him this morning.

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:14.560
This is the busiest time before opening.

00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:16.279
Great, and he's slacking off.

00:04:16.639 --> 00:04:18.600
He's not the type to slack off.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:21.519
Wait, you two this morning...

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:22.680
...didn't see him at all?

00:04:23.319 --> 00:04:24.480
No.

00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.120
He didn't reply to messages last night either.

00:04:26.439 --> 00:04:27.480
If that's the case...

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.680
When I went to see my parents this morning...

00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.000
...there was no sound from his room.

00:04:30.199 --> 00:04:31.240
After I came back...

00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:32.560
...the things I should do...

00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:34.360
...and the things I wanted to do, I've already done them.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:36.959
As for what comes next...

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.560
...just let it be.

00:04:39.399 --> 00:04:40.920
I appreciate your feelings for me.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.000
But I don't have much time left.

00:04:43.639 --> 00:04:45.079
I don't want to live in a wretched state.

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.680
And I don't want anyone's pity.

00:04:47.079 --> 00:04:48.279
Do you understand what I mean?

00:04:49.079 --> 00:04:50.160
Where has he gone?

00:04:50.519 --> 00:04:51.360
Darn it.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.839
Big Brother, what's wrong?

00:04:54.199 --> 00:04:55.000
What happened?

00:05:02.839 --> 00:05:03.160
Big Brother?

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:03.600
Weiguo!

00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:05.920
I always said he was unreliable.

00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:06.920
What time is it, and he's still sleeping?

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.720
Weiguo!

00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:09.480
Weiguo! Weiguo!

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:10.920
Weiguo!

00:05:12.399 --> 00:05:13.480
Weiguo!

00:05:18.079 --> 00:05:18.839
Big Brother! Big Brother!

00:05:18.839 --> 00:05:19.160
Weiguo!

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:19.839
Big Brother, it's not that serious.

00:05:19.839 --> 00:05:21.079
No, you don't know.

00:05:21.079 --> 00:05:22.160
Well... still, it can't be that bad.

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:24.079
What's this?

00:05:24.759 --> 00:05:25.439
Bro.

00:05:25.639 --> 00:05:26.480
What is it?

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.639
Is this a password?

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:28.480
Try it.

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:31.079
It really is.

00:05:31.399 --> 00:05:32.360
Weiguo...

00:05:32.639 --> 00:05:33.519
Weiguo...

00:05:33.879 --> 00:05:35.199
Packed up and left.

00:05:35.839 --> 00:05:36.839
Weiguo...

00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:51.040
I'm gone.

00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.360
By the time you read this letter...

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:53.720
...I will already...

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.560
I'm gone.

00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:56.879
By the time you read this letter...

00:05:57.040 --> 00:05:58.519
...I will already be in America.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:05.439
I came back just to make you admit your mistakes and apologize.

00:06:08.319 --> 00:06:09.800
Now that wish is fulfilled.

00:06:09.959 --> 00:06:12.560
There's nothing left to hold me here. Farewell.

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:15.040
I originally wanted to wait until...

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.519
...the cooperation between Peng Le Xuan and Dong Qian...

00:06:16.519 --> 00:06:18.040
...was formally established before leaving.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.360
But reality doesn't permit it.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:23.600
Fortunately, things are on track now.

00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:28.199
The next step is up to you.

00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:30.560
I set up a fund a while ago.

00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.720
Once matters in the US are settled...

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:34.800
...a lawyer will contact you.

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.720
Our brotherhood ends here.

00:06:39.639 --> 00:06:41.480
If there's a chance in the next life...

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.959
...goodbye.

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:57.680
Goodbye.

00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.720
What's going on?

00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:10.720
He was fine yesterday.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:12.160
How could he just up and leave like that?

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.800
That bastard, he ran off again.

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.160
He's sick.

00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.199
He really is sick.

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:18.319
Yeah, he's sick.

00:07:18.319 --> 00:07:19.160
He's genuinely ill.

00:07:19.240 --> 00:07:21.000
If he weren't sick, would he do something like this?

00:07:21.199 --> 00:07:22.040
No.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.959
He has something growing in his brain.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.040
Brain cancer.

00:07:30.519 --> 00:07:32.800
Big Brother, did he trick you again?

00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:33.759
No.

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:34.920
Is it true?

00:07:35.480 --> 00:07:36.439
It's true.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.480
How do you know, Tongtong?

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:43.040
Late-stage glioma.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.040
I took him to the hospital.

00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.199
He came back because of this.

00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.519
You took him?

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.600
Martin.

00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:55.079
Suspected tumor pathology.

00:07:56.279 --> 00:07:57.120
Second Brother.

00:08:00.079 --> 00:08:01.879
I'm going to find him right now.

00:08:01.959 --> 00:08:03.120
Which one of you is coming with me?

00:08:03.120 --> 00:08:04.680
No, wait, wait, wait, hold on, bro.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:07.120
This is a bit chaotic. How did it suddenly...

00:08:07.959 --> 00:08:08.680
Calm down, calm down.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:10.240
Let's all calm down first and think.

00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.720
How did it suddenly come to this?

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.959
You... you want to go?

00:08:12.959 --> 00:08:14.680
Do... do you even have a visa?

00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.000
I'll get one.

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:24.720
This is something I can't control either.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:27.480
The necessary procedures must be followed.

00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:31.839
I heard...

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.039
...that President Yang from Keyong...

00:08:34.039 --> 00:08:34.720
...also went to Beijing.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:36.519
And stayed for over a week.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.679
I imagine you ran into him?

00:08:40.039 --> 00:08:40.720
Old Ma.

00:08:42.679 --> 00:08:45.120
As a co-founder of Rice...

00:08:45.679 --> 00:08:47.240
...you know the situation of every business line...

00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:48.120
...better than anyone.

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.840
And you hold a significant amount of shares.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:52.919
Now you suddenly want to resign for no apparent reason.

00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:53.840
Of course...

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:56.360
...I trust you one hundred percent.

00:08:57.960 --> 00:08:59.519
But what others might think...

00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.120
...is another matter.

00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:05.679
What are you laughing at?

00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:06.960
I'm laughing at myself.

00:09:09.639 --> 00:09:11.879
There's something I don't know if I should say...

00:09:12.399 --> 00:09:13.720
...but I'll say it anyway.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.120
If you start your own business, only I can invest.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:19.320
If others get involved...

00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:22.039
...I wouldn't be at ease.

00:09:23.159 --> 00:09:24.480
You don't need to worry.

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:26.519
We can sign a non-compete agreement.

00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.399
And I can also guarantee...

00:09:28.399 --> 00:09:29.960
...that I won't enter this industry again.

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:32.039
As for all my equity...

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:33.399
...I can also transfer it to you.

00:09:33.399 --> 00:09:34.679
The detailed specifics...

00:09:35.039 --> 00:09:36.399
...let Lawyer Wang discuss with you.

00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:39.919
Old Ma.

00:09:45.399 --> 00:09:46.600
No matter what...

00:09:48.039 --> 00:09:49.600
...Rice is your child.

00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:51.399
When you have time...

00:09:51.639 --> 00:09:52.759
...come back and visit often.

00:10:26.919 --> 00:10:28.000
Welcome home.

00:10:53.919 --> 00:10:55.600
You finally decided to come back.

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:01.080
No, wait for me a second.

00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.879
I've been waiting for you all night.

00:11:13.519 --> 00:11:15.639
You must be exhausted after such a long flight.

00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.759
Maybe rest a bit, get over the jet lag.

00:11:19.039 --> 00:11:20.679
This place of yours isn't bad.

00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:23.720
The location, the size...

00:11:24.039 --> 00:11:25.159
Not cheap, right?

00:11:25.799 --> 00:11:27.919
It's okay. I bought it early.

00:11:28.679 --> 00:11:30.480
More Chinese people have been coming these past two years.

00:11:30.559 --> 00:11:31.840
That's what drove the housing prices up.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:34.679
Get me something to eat, will you?

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.679
The food on the plane was awful.

00:11:37.559 --> 00:11:38.399
Something light.

00:11:38.399 --> 00:11:39.679
I've been a bit under the weather lately.

00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.559
You're so demanding.

00:11:43.039 --> 00:11:44.639
I don't usually cook for myself either.

00:11:45.039 --> 00:11:46.399
Just eat whatever's in the fridge.

00:11:46.399 --> 00:11:47.960
No, I came all this way...

00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.159
And this is how you treat me?

00:11:55.039 --> 00:11:56.600
Big Brother, Qiu'er.

00:11:56.799 --> 00:11:58.720
I've arrived. I've seen Weiguo.

00:11:59.120 --> 00:11:59.840
Where is he?

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.200
How is he now?

00:12:01.720 --> 00:12:03.679
He's fine, alive and well.

00:12:03.679 --> 00:12:04.399
Hold on.

00:12:09.879 --> 00:12:11.240
Big Brother, Qiu'er.

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.120
Weiguo.

00:12:12.639 --> 00:12:14.159
H-how are you doing now?

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.200
You... you know...

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.840
Listen to your big brother.

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.679
If there's no place to treat you over there,

00:12:18.679 --> 00:12:19.559
then come back.

00:12:19.559 --> 00:12:21.360
We'll be together and figure it out together.

00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:22.360
We'll get you proper treatment.

00:12:22.360 --> 00:12:24.159
If you find the few of us annoying,

00:12:24.159 --> 00:12:25.679
we won't bother you.

00:12:25.879 --> 00:12:27.559
Weiguo, you have to come back.

00:12:27.679 --> 00:12:29.440
You need someone to take care of you.

00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:30.840
I'm pretty good at taking care of people.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.840
I've gotten used to it caring for my dad these years.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:33.840
If you come back, I'll definitely...

00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:35.039
...take care of you real good.

00:12:36.279 --> 00:12:37.840
Thanks, I appreciate the thought.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.360
You... listen to Big Brother.

00:12:39.559 --> 00:12:40.480
Weiguo.

00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:41.840
If you really leave like that,

00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:43.559
I'll never be at peace for the rest of my life.

00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.919
Qiu'er, Qiu'er, Qiu'er.

00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.480
Don't talk like that, it's bad luck.

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:47.480
What are you doing?

00:12:50.919 --> 00:12:51.840
It's fine, it's fine.

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:53.559
And don't worry about that either.

00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:55.320
I think Weiguo is doing just fine.

00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.320
Nothing's wrong.

00:12:56.559 --> 00:12:58.559
Let's just go about our business.

00:12:58.960 --> 00:12:59.679
Listen to me.

00:12:59.679 --> 00:13:01.679
Alright, then... Second Brother, thanks for your trouble.

00:13:01.679 --> 00:13:03.320
If... if anything comes up, call.

00:13:03.679 --> 00:13:04.840
That's it, hanging up now.

00:13:18.039 --> 00:13:18.879
That's it?

00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:22.159
This is no different from being on the plane.

00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:25.080
Peng Le Xuan is about to open.

00:13:25.279 --> 00:13:26.200
Aren't you busy?

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.559
Busy or not,

00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:30.720
after all this time running around,

00:13:30.759 --> 00:13:32.600
you gotta relax a little too.

00:13:36.879 --> 00:13:37.879
This trip,

00:13:38.399 --> 00:13:39.559
how long are you planning to stay?

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:43.840
Hard to say.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.759
I've been here so many times before,

00:13:45.879 --> 00:13:47.440
but never really got to explore properly.

00:13:47.799 --> 00:13:49.720
Every time, it's just rushing to meetings,

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:50.639
and leaving right after.

00:13:51.159 --> 00:13:52.080
This time,

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:54.159
I really plan to stay for a good while.

00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:00.919
Look.

00:14:01.679 --> 00:14:02.480
Towel.

00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:07.720
Cup, toothbrush, shower gel.

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:10.200
I even brought a thermos.

00:14:12.559 --> 00:14:13.840
If you don't have anything going on,

00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.440
keep me company these next few days.

00:14:16.799 --> 00:14:17.639
Take your time eating.

00:14:17.639 --> 00:14:18.639
I'm heading to my room first.

00:14:20.039 --> 00:14:21.120
You can crash on the sofa.

00:14:21.679 --> 00:14:22.320
No.

00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.200
What time is it even?

00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.360
Going to bed so early?

00:14:25.360 --> 00:14:26.360
Let's chat a bit more.

00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.080
Good night.

00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:32.960
What a guy.

00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.879
Uncle, how's it going?

00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:57.799
Keep your voice down.

00:16:03.320 --> 00:16:04.679
It's normal for now.

00:16:04.679 --> 00:16:05.679
But you know him,

00:16:05.679 --> 00:16:06.799
his stubborn temper.

00:16:06.919 --> 00:16:08.200
Stubborn as a mule.

00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.799
I can't say too much either.

00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:12.519
Dare not force it. It's giving me a headache.

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.519
You really don't plan to come over?

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.679
I really don't understand you guys.

00:16:17.679 --> 00:16:19.240
What exactly are you all thinking?

00:16:20.679 --> 00:16:22.120
Uncle, I told you,

00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.519
there was nothing between us before,

00:16:23.559 --> 00:16:25.120
and there definitely won't be anything after.

00:16:26.519 --> 00:16:28.360
It doesn't look that way to me.

00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:30.039
Uncle, please stop guessing.

00:16:30.039 --> 00:16:31.960
I'll send you some stuff, some materials.

00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:33.840
Use it if it helps, forget it if it doesn't.

00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:35.559
Anyway, I can't be bothered with his business.

00:16:35.679 --> 00:16:36.399
Bye.

00:16:40.519 --> 00:16:41.879
What an attitude.

00:16:59.639 --> 00:17:00.919
Women...

00:17:01.519 --> 00:17:02.799
Every single one of them.

00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.599
Who knows what they're thinking.

00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:34.079
No, look, here's the thing.

00:17:34.319 --> 00:17:36.079
Can you just take a look for me?

00:17:36.079 --> 00:17:37.960
I really don't dare give you wrong info.

00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.559
Just take a look for me, please?

00:17:41.680 --> 00:17:44.240
Desperate times call for desperate measures, I get it.

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.799
Alright, Lao Wang.

00:17:48.799 --> 00:17:51.559
My classmates, friends...

00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.720
I'll find everyone I can for you.

00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:57.079
Don't worry.

00:17:57.440 --> 00:17:58.759
Anyone I can find,

00:17:58.759 --> 00:18:00.079
I won't leave a single one out.

00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:00.880
Okay?

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:04.599
Alright, brother. I'm counting on you.

00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.279
I'll wait for your call.

00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:16.640
I'm off.

00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.200
Okay.

00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:03.640
Hey, Jing'er.

00:19:03.799 --> 00:19:04.920
Hey, Chunsheng.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:07.400
You remember my dad's chess buddy, Uncle Fu, right?

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.920
His son-in-law works at Xiehe Hospital.

00:19:08.920 --> 00:19:11.160
I'll have my dad ask him for some advice later.

00:19:12.359 --> 00:19:14.160
I'll text you his number in a bit.

00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.480
Alright, send it over.

00:19:15.480 --> 00:19:15.920
Mom.

00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.720
Hold on a sec, Feifei wants to talk to you.

00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:19.400
Dad.

00:19:19.920 --> 00:19:21.160
I just looked it up online.

00:19:21.160 --> 00:19:22.240
It says these next few days,

00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:24.039
a group of experts from Shanghai will be in Beijing.

00:19:24.039 --> 00:19:25.920
Maybe we can go try to find them?

00:19:26.319 --> 00:19:27.799
Sure, you look up the address first.

00:19:27.799 --> 00:19:29.240
Then text it to me.

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:30.920
The address.

00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:32.720
Okay, I'll look it up and send it to you.

00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:33.359
Alright.

00:19:33.359 --> 00:19:34.279
Don't hang up yet.

00:19:34.519 --> 00:19:36.440
Are you coming back for dinner later?

00:19:36.599 --> 00:19:38.039
I won't be back for dinner.

00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.720
Text me that phone number.

00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.720
I'm heading to Xiehe right now.

00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.680
While they're still at work.

00:19:42.200 --> 00:19:42.799
Okay then.

00:19:42.799 --> 00:19:44.160
Grab a bite to eat outside.

00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.000
Alright, alright.

00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:10.160
Weiguo.

00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:14.839
Weiguo.

00:20:20.359 --> 00:20:21.680
Ma Weiguo!

00:20:29.039 --> 00:20:30.359
Where did you go?

00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.519
To buy breakfast. Foreign breakfast.

00:20:32.720 --> 00:20:33.519
Make do with this.

00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:35.240
You have a conscience, I'll give you that.

00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:42.960
This is it?

00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.119
This can't compare to soy milk and fried dough sticks.

00:20:45.960 --> 00:20:47.319
What about yours? Not eating?

00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.400
I'm not hungry.

00:20:49.039 --> 00:20:50.519
I'm not really hungry either.

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:51.599
But the thing is,

00:20:51.599 --> 00:20:53.400
when it's time to eat, you gotta eat heartily.

00:20:53.559 --> 00:20:55.720
Then you'll have energy to go out and have fun later.

00:20:57.720 --> 00:20:59.079
There's nothing fun here.

00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:01.920
I've tried all the things to do and see. Boring.

00:21:03.079 --> 00:21:03.960
It's different.

00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:06.039
Going out by yourself

00:21:06.039 --> 00:21:06.920
versus going with friends

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.160
is completely different, okay?

00:21:08.519 --> 00:21:09.440
Let me tell you,

00:21:09.799 --> 00:21:11.039
where you go isn't important.

00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:13.400
But who you go with is.

00:21:13.759 --> 00:21:14.720
For example,

00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:17.279
some tourist spots might seem ordinary,

00:21:17.279 --> 00:21:19.160
but if you go with your buddies,

00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:20.640
it becomes a lot more fun.

00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:24.480
Didn't you say it doesn't taste good?

00:21:24.559 --> 00:21:25.599
Yet you're eating it so eagerly.

00:21:29.039 --> 00:21:29.839
I'm full.

00:21:31.279 --> 00:21:32.480
That's just how I am.

00:21:32.759 --> 00:21:34.079
The worse something tastes,

00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.680
the more I wolf it down.

00:21:37.359 --> 00:21:38.480
Alright, let's go.

00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:41.680
The apartment is yours.

00:21:41.680 --> 00:21:43.920
Stay as long as you like. I'm leaving.

00:21:45.759 --> 00:21:46.759
What do you mean?

00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:49.880
Wait for me, let me change.

00:21:50.359 --> 00:21:51.599
I say, Boss Ma,

00:21:51.599 --> 00:21:53.039
you're really generous.

00:21:53.039 --> 00:21:55.279
Just giving up such a nice place like that.

00:21:56.039 --> 00:21:57.079
Just worldly possessions.

00:21:57.279 --> 00:21:58.039
If you like it,

00:21:58.039 --> 00:21:59.480
stay as long as you want.

00:21:59.480 --> 00:22:00.480
There are lots of things I like.

00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:01.440
What else have you got?

00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:03.160
Perfect timing, let's go see.

00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:05.799
Martin.

00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.160
Jack.

00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:14.319
You okay?

00:22:14.799 --> 00:22:16.160
Far from okay.

00:22:16.279 --> 00:22:17.559
You try getting whacked on the head.

00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.000
How do you manage to piss people off everywhere?

00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:20.799
It hurts like hell.

00:22:21.319 --> 00:22:22.079
Let's head back first.

00:22:23.519 --> 00:22:25.400
Go back and put some ointment on. Let's go.

00:22:26.559 --> 00:22:27.440
Dizzy.

00:22:27.799 --> 00:22:28.519
Quick, quick, quick.

00:22:28.519 --> 00:22:29.880
It's fine, your head's hard.

00:22:32.119 --> 00:22:33.079
Go back and put some ointment on.

00:22:40.319 --> 00:22:40.920
About all this...

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:41.599
Manager Tong.

00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.720
Please don't worry about any of this.

00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:44.119
Okay.

00:22:44.119 --> 00:22:45.599
Call me anytime if there's a problem.

00:22:45.599 --> 00:22:46.079
Okay, no problem.

00:22:46.079 --> 00:22:47.079
I stay up late anyway.

00:22:47.079 --> 00:22:48.079
Alright, sounds good.

00:22:49.839 --> 00:22:50.559
Actually, perfect timing.

00:22:56.359 --> 00:22:57.599
Okay, that works.

00:22:57.599 --> 00:22:58.079
Thank you, Manager Tong.

00:22:58.079 --> 00:22:58.839
Sister Fan, let's keep in touch.

00:22:58.839 --> 00:22:59.319
Okay, goodbye.

00:22:59.319 --> 00:23:00.079
Thank you, thank you.

00:23:00.079 --> 00:23:00.720
Alright.

00:23:16.359 --> 00:23:17.119
Big Brother.

00:23:17.240 --> 00:23:19.440
How come there's no news from Second Brother?

00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:26.119
Look at how you've been performing these past two months.

00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:28.039
Your team's key performance indicators aren't being met.

00:23:28.039 --> 00:23:29.680
Your results can't even match Tong Qiu's now.

00:23:29.839 --> 00:23:31.359
Assistant Jia, do you not want this job anymore?

00:23:31.839 --> 00:23:32.680
What are you standing there for?

00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:33.400
Get out.

00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:40.839
Old Tong.

00:23:43.279 --> 00:23:44.599
You've been doing great lately.

00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.039
Just this month was okay.

00:23:47.319 --> 00:23:48.680
You're being too modest.

00:23:51.559 --> 00:23:53.119
Assistant Jia, don't take it too seriously.

00:23:53.119 --> 00:23:55.000
The branch manager speaks without thinking.

00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:56.400
Don't take it to heart.

00:23:58.759 --> 00:23:59.640
Thanks.

00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.599
We're all colleagues.

00:24:07.839 --> 00:24:09.319
I've been talking to a client recently.

00:24:09.319 --> 00:24:10.680
It's pretty much settled.

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.079
But he's in Xi'an.

00:24:12.079 --> 00:24:13.319
Insists I go there to finalize it.

00:24:13.559 --> 00:24:15.160
I'm swamped here and can't get away.

00:24:16.319 --> 00:24:17.079
Would it be convenient for you?

00:24:18.279 --> 00:24:19.200
Xi'an?

00:24:20.319 --> 00:24:21.319
Yes, yes, convenient.

00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:22.319
Alright then.

00:24:22.319 --> 00:24:22.839
I'll then,

00:24:22.839 --> 00:24:24.799
send you the contact info and materials.

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:25.720
Thanks.

00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:26.960
Okay, thank you.

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.640
I'll go first.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:33.880
Come in.

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:05.279
You really did come looking for me.

00:25:05.839 --> 00:25:06.599
What happened?

00:25:06.599 --> 00:25:08.079
I couldn't find a job.

00:25:08.079 --> 00:25:10.480
Got divorced, and the bank took the house.

00:25:10.680 --> 00:25:11.839
But you're doing just fine.

00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:15.559
God must be blind.

00:25:16.079 --> 00:25:17.319
Seeing me like this...

00:25:17.319 --> 00:25:18.319
...you must be happy, right?

00:25:18.319 --> 00:25:19.359
You're right.

00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.599
I'm not a good person.

00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:23.680
To be precise, I'm a jerk.

00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:26.079
But you're no saint either.

00:25:26.079 --> 00:25:27.839
You work for a Chinese company...

00:25:27.839 --> 00:25:29.240
...yet you look down on us Chinese.

00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:31.920
The state you're in now...

00:25:32.079 --> 00:25:33.359
...you deserve it, you know that?

00:25:33.599 --> 00:25:36.079
We Chinese have an old saying.

00:25:36.079 --> 00:25:37.680
It's better to resolve a feud than to keep it going.

00:25:38.839 --> 00:25:41.319
Let bygones be bygones.

00:25:45.599 --> 00:25:46.319
Take it.

00:25:48.079 --> 00:25:48.839
Martin.

00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:51.960
Don't you want to know...

00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:53.279
...why I targeted you back then?

00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:55.839
Do you think people like us...

00:25:55.839 --> 00:25:56.960
...really have friends?

00:25:57.799 --> 00:25:58.839
He promised me...

00:25:58.839 --> 00:25:59.680
...that if I took you down...

00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:01.400
...I could retire ten years early.

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:15.839
You say I...

00:26:16.599 --> 00:26:18.720
...instigated Jack against you?

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:22.400
Do you believe that?

00:26:22.599 --> 00:26:23.559
Ten years.

00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.279
We started a business together for ten years.

00:26:27.559 --> 00:26:29.119
We may not be sworn brothers...

00:26:29.319 --> 00:26:30.880
...but we were at least like brothers.

00:26:31.720 --> 00:26:34.440
Of course I knew you weren't targeting me.

00:26:34.799 --> 00:26:36.319
You were just using someone else to do your dirty work.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.359
You used me to take down Jack.

00:26:39.799 --> 00:26:42.119
And made sure he blamed me for everything.

00:26:42.119 --> 00:26:43.359
While you walked away clean.

00:26:43.359 --> 00:26:44.920
It must be a misunderstanding.

00:26:45.599 --> 00:26:47.119
Haven't you always wanted to know...

00:26:47.599 --> 00:26:49.200
...why I suddenly quit?

00:27:08.599 --> 00:27:10.000
When was this?

00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:20.759
Whatever you need me to do, just say it.

00:27:21.359 --> 00:27:22.519
I don't need anything.

00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:27.599
Then how about this.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.240
The terms you offered before...

00:27:29.759 --> 00:27:30.960
...I agree to all of them.

00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:32.880
We'll do it your way.

00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.400
The commercial investigation...

00:27:34.519 --> 00:27:35.640
...will stop immediately.

00:27:35.839 --> 00:27:36.920
Your funds...

00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:39.039
...will be unfrozen soon.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.759
No need for a non-compete agreement either.

00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:43.240
It's just the matter of transferring the shares.

00:27:44.200 --> 00:27:46.079
Let's get it done as soon as possible, okay?

00:27:46.240 --> 00:27:47.240
Sorry about this...

00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:48.839
...but I've changed my mind.

00:27:49.839 --> 00:27:51.119
You know me...

00:27:51.319 --> 00:27:52.839
...I hate being used the most.

00:27:53.200 --> 00:27:54.359
And this matter...

00:27:54.359 --> 00:27:55.680
...involves my brother.

00:27:55.839 --> 00:27:56.720
There's no room for discussion.

00:27:57.480 --> 00:27:58.599
Then what do you want?

00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:01.079
I've already contacted...

00:28:01.200 --> 00:28:03.079
...your old rival, General Manager Yang.

00:28:03.359 --> 00:28:05.720
I'll transfer all my shares to him.

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:08.200
If you want to keep investigating, go ahead.

00:28:08.319 --> 00:28:09.200
I'll see it through to the end.

00:28:09.200 --> 00:28:11.119
Rice can't handle all this.

00:28:12.039 --> 00:28:12.759
I'm sorry.

00:28:13.960 --> 00:28:14.720
Given your situation...

00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:15.960
...I shouldn't have lost my temper with you.

00:28:15.960 --> 00:28:18.079
Old Ma, I admit I was wrong before.

00:28:18.119 --> 00:28:19.319
I beg for your forgiveness.

00:28:19.519 --> 00:28:20.400
But...

00:28:20.599 --> 00:28:21.599
...let's just leave it at that.

00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:22.559
Old Ma...

00:28:39.599 --> 00:28:40.720
Fine, fine, fine.

00:28:40.839 --> 00:28:41.720
He kicked you?

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.839
More than kicked me, he even talked to me.

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:44.920
What did he say?

00:28:45.119 --> 00:28:47.079
He said Mommy works very hard.

00:28:47.079 --> 00:28:48.920
He told Daddy to take good care of Mommy.

00:28:49.119 --> 00:28:50.640
Alright, stop joking around.

00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:51.880
Watch out, he might end up like you.

00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:53.359
What do you mean, 'end up like me'?

00:28:53.359 --> 00:28:54.000
I'm his father.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.519
Who else would he take after if not me?

00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:07.640
Seeing you has cheered me up a lot.

00:29:10.079 --> 00:29:10.920
Honey.

00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:12.640
Don't worry too much.

00:29:13.440 --> 00:29:15.240
Third Brother has been through so much.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.920
No matter how hard it is, he'll pull through.

00:29:18.599 --> 00:29:20.759
I believe Second Brother will definitely bring him back.

00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:22.359
Let's reach out to...

00:29:22.359 --> 00:29:24.839
...any doctors or hospitals we know.

00:29:25.119 --> 00:29:26.880
When he comes back...

00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:28.640
...we have to take him to see a doctor.

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:29.880
Okay.

00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:32.400
It's getting late.

00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:34.640
I'm off to meet a client now.

00:29:35.359 --> 00:29:36.000
Oh, right.

00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.119
I'll send you the address later.

00:29:38.119 --> 00:29:39.359
Then after work, you head over.

00:29:39.359 --> 00:29:40.839
We'll have dinner at the mall.

00:29:41.319 --> 00:29:41.839
Alright.

00:29:56.759 --> 00:29:57.359
Honey

00:29:57.359 --> 00:29:59.079
I left a file at your place.

00:29:59.599 --> 00:30:01.519
Yes, okay. I'll bring it over in a bit.

00:30:01.519 --> 00:30:03.599
Alright, I'll send you the location later.

00:30:03.599 --> 00:30:04.359
When you're done,

00:30:04.359 --> 00:30:05.720
bring the file to me here.

00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.839
Then we can have dinner together.

00:30:09.279 --> 00:30:09.960
Okay.

00:30:14.359 --> 00:30:16.319
Director Cao, this is Tong Qiu.

00:30:16.319 --> 00:30:17.839
We spoke before.

00:30:18.079 --> 00:30:18.599
Have a seat.

00:30:19.839 --> 00:30:20.519
Hello.

00:30:23.599 --> 00:30:24.839
Long time no see.

00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:26.359
Director... Director Qiu?

00:30:26.759 --> 00:30:28.000
Long time no see.

00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.359
What... what are you doing here today?

00:30:32.119 --> 00:30:33.240
You didn't know?

00:30:33.680 --> 00:30:35.359
Director Cao and I are old friends.

00:30:37.119 --> 00:30:39.400
Old friends, old friends.

00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.440
Didn't I tell you?

00:30:42.759 --> 00:30:44.359
He's quite handsome, isn't he?

00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:46.880
Indeed, clean-cut features.

00:30:46.880 --> 00:30:48.160
Quite likable.

00:30:50.559 --> 00:30:51.920
What's the use of being handsome?

00:30:53.359 --> 00:30:54.799
He just can't take a joke.

00:30:56.559 --> 00:30:57.839
No, Director Qiu, really...

00:30:57.839 --> 00:30:58.960
About before, I'm sorry.

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:00.160
I don't socialize much.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.759
So I hope you understand.

00:31:03.039 --> 00:31:05.559
Can't take a joke, and on top of that, hypocritical.

00:31:05.599 --> 00:31:07.599
Says one thing to your face, another behind your back.

00:31:09.559 --> 00:31:11.160
What do you mean by that?

00:31:11.559 --> 00:31:12.839
Playing dumb with me?

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:15.079
I've heard.

00:31:15.359 --> 00:31:16.839
You've been telling people everywhere

00:31:16.839 --> 00:31:18.640
that you could have me in a minute.

00:31:19.119 --> 00:31:21.839
And that I'm past my prime, you're not interested.

00:31:22.119 --> 00:31:23.799
Even if I threw myself at you,

00:31:24.319 --> 00:31:25.599
you wouldn't take the bait, right?

00:31:25.599 --> 00:31:27.559
Impossible! Who told you that?

00:31:28.200 --> 00:31:31.079
Impossible! He wouldn't do such a thing.

00:31:33.119 --> 00:31:34.039
Honey!

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:36.119
Husband, I brought it for you.

00:31:36.279 --> 00:31:37.359
Don't be so careless next time.

00:31:37.359 --> 00:31:38.880
You're his wife?

00:31:41.319 --> 00:31:42.640
This guy here,

00:31:43.039 --> 00:31:45.440
talks a lot, very gossipy.

00:31:45.599 --> 00:31:47.279
But at heart, he's an honest man.

00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:48.599
Thin-skinned.

00:31:48.599 --> 00:31:49.680
Not very tough mentally either.

00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:51.119
Even if you tried to force him to do something bad,

00:31:51.119 --> 00:31:52.400
he wouldn't be able to do it.

00:31:52.839 --> 00:31:54.519
Alright, you two chat.

00:31:54.519 --> 00:31:55.480
Okay, okay.

00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.119
Tong Tong.

00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.319
All those things between us...

00:31:59.319 --> 00:32:00.839
You didn't report to your wife?

00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:03.839
Don't talk nonsense.

00:32:03.839 --> 00:32:05.200
What things between us?

00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:08.039
We have lots of things between us.

00:32:08.039 --> 00:32:09.319
I even have evidence.

00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:10.240
Let me see.

00:32:11.240 --> 00:32:12.880
Photos? I have to see those.

00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:14.640
Our Tong Qiu here,

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.920
doesn't have any great talents.

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:17.680
He just has one virtue.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.400
He hides nothing from me.

00:32:19.519 --> 00:32:21.240
Here, take a look.

00:32:21.519 --> 00:32:22.680
Is it this one?

00:32:27.880 --> 00:32:28.960
That's the one.

00:32:29.799 --> 00:32:31.599
I thought it was some big scandal.

00:32:31.599 --> 00:32:32.720
Just this?

00:32:34.519 --> 00:32:35.359
Honey.

00:32:44.039 --> 00:32:45.000
If I...

00:32:45.759 --> 00:32:47.079
show you my phone,

00:32:47.079 --> 00:32:49.920
can you promise not to get angry?

00:32:50.759 --> 00:32:51.839
What do you mean?

00:32:53.039 --> 00:32:54.119
I mean,

00:32:54.119 --> 00:32:55.880
if I show you my phone, someone just

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:57.039
sent me a picture.

00:32:57.039 --> 00:32:58.559
But don't get angry, okay?

00:32:58.759 --> 00:33:00.160
I won't get angry.

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:00.759
Okay.

00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.400
Go ahead, show me.

00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.839
Don't get angry.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:23.880
It's... it's a bit hot in here.

00:33:24.200 --> 00:33:25.519
I'm sweating.

00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:27.119
Just took a shower. Where's your towel?

00:33:27.119 --> 00:33:28.599
Here, here it is, here.

00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:33.119
Sweating like this, so useless.

00:33:41.279 --> 00:33:43.640
You've gained quite a bit of weight lately.

00:33:44.440 --> 00:33:46.119
Your fitness management is lacking.

00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:51.319
My heart... scared me to death.

00:33:51.839 --> 00:33:53.599
I'm... having hot and cold flashes.

00:33:53.599 --> 00:33:54.680
I feel like these few seconds

00:33:55.039 --> 00:33:56.759
felt like a whole century.

00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.559
Good that you're not angry.

00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:00.039
Of course I'm angry.

00:34:12.320 --> 00:34:13.039
Tong Tong.

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:15.639
Didn't expect you to be a henpecked husband.

00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:18.320
That's because we trust each other.

00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.039
We have no secrets between us.

00:34:23.599 --> 00:34:24.800
Tell me, in this world,

00:34:24.800 --> 00:34:26.840
where are all the good men, right?

00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:29.280
He doesn't fancy me today,

00:34:29.480 --> 00:34:31.119
tomorrow he might fancy someone else.

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:34.320
Little sister, I advise you not to be naive.

00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:36.360
Don't be fooled by this man in front of you.

00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:37.960
No, Director Qiu, please stop talking nonsense.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.159
In my phone here,

00:34:39.159 --> 00:34:40.880
the chat logs, the photos...

00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.159
He has... deceived me plenty.

00:34:47.599 --> 00:34:49.599
Constantly making up lies to me.

00:34:50.039 --> 00:34:51.800
I've caught him out countless times.

00:34:51.800 --> 00:34:53.360
You say it yourself, isn't that right?

00:34:54.079 --> 00:34:54.960
Many times.

00:34:55.360 --> 00:34:56.920
But every time he lies to me,

00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:59.360
it's about a promotion, a raise,

00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:00.840
whether I've gained weight again,

00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.800
what clothes look good on me, things like that.

00:35:03.039 --> 00:35:05.119
To keep me in a good mood normally,

00:35:05.119 --> 00:35:06.519
he'll make up any lie.

00:35:06.639 --> 00:35:08.360
But when it comes to crucial matters,

00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:09.559
even if I would get angry,

00:35:09.559 --> 00:35:11.039
he never hides them from me.

00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:12.559
That's what being a couple is about.

00:35:12.559 --> 00:35:14.000
Who doesn't argue?

00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:15.639
After arguments like this,

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:17.280
I actually feel more at ease.

00:35:18.519 --> 00:35:19.360
Director Qiu.

00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:21.760
You're not wrong.

00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:23.599
There aren't many good men out there.

00:35:24.519 --> 00:35:26.800
But I just happened to meet one good man.

00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.639
Call it my good luck.

00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:33.679
Anything else to discuss?

00:35:34.360 --> 00:35:37.599
I... I-I-I... what was I going to discuss?

00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:39.199
Well, uh, Director Cao,

00:35:39.519 --> 00:35:40.079
I'm sorry.

00:35:40.079 --> 00:35:41.880
I'll... I'll contact you again later.

00:35:42.679 --> 00:35:43.920
Director Qiu, sorry.

00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.159
Let's go.

00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:50.360
Forgot my bag.

00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:51.960
I just told you not to be careless.

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:52.840
Sorry about that.

00:35:58.239 --> 00:35:59.440
Can't take a joke.

00:36:07.199 --> 00:36:09.119
I'm probably going to lose this job.

00:36:09.119 --> 00:36:10.159
But it's okay.

00:36:10.159 --> 00:36:11.719
You were just awesome back there.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.559
Of course.

00:36:13.039 --> 00:36:14.960
Don't worry about the job either.

00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:16.320
Worst case, I'll take care of you.

00:36:16.480 --> 00:36:17.719
I can't let you do that.

00:36:17.719 --> 00:36:18.800
You have enough on your plate.

00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:20.159
And you're carrying our baby.

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:23.559
Anyway, we have evidence, so we're not afraid of her.

00:36:23.679 --> 00:36:25.480
If she tries to harm you regardless of her reputation,

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:26.800
then we won't hold back either.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.679
How did I get so lucky?

00:36:29.719 --> 00:36:31.800
To have such a wonderful wife.

00:36:34.599 --> 00:36:35.679
But don't you worry.

00:36:35.679 --> 00:36:37.280
I can handle all of this.

00:36:37.639 --> 00:36:39.199
Let's go get something good to eat first.

00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:41.159
Don't scare the baby in your belly.

00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:42.760
Let's go.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:43.199
Let's go.

00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:52.000
Didn't you say you really wanted to die?

00:36:52.119 --> 00:36:53.639
I actually came up with an idea.

00:36:53.639 --> 00:36:54.920
To let you die once.

00:37:00.239 --> 00:37:01.679
We'll act as if you're already dead.

00:37:02.199 --> 00:37:03.480
Hold a funeral for you.

00:37:03.679 --> 00:37:05.079
So you can see for yourself

00:37:05.079 --> 00:37:06.440
what it's like after you die.

00:37:07.559 --> 00:37:08.760
How did you think of this?

00:37:08.920 --> 00:37:10.000
To be honest with you,

00:37:10.440 --> 00:37:12.400
I've had this idea for a long time.

00:37:12.519 --> 00:37:14.000
I really wanted to know

00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:15.440
what it's like for a person after they die.

00:37:15.440 --> 00:37:17.440
Alright, you're getting a freebie this time.

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.400
Hello, Manager Zhao?

00:37:34.559 --> 00:37:36.960
The funeral I asked you to prepare for me earlier,

00:37:38.719 --> 00:37:40.039
can be held now.

00:37:43.519 --> 00:37:45.880
Mr. Martin's life began with

00:37:45.880 --> 00:37:49.119
his most enduring quality: kindness.

00:37:49.119 --> 00:37:52.920
It ended with his noblest character: integrity.

00:37:53.119 --> 00:37:54.880
He shone like the sun,

00:37:54.880 --> 00:37:57.159
and will continue to shine.

00:37:57.159 --> 00:37:58.440
We miss him.

00:37:58.440 --> 00:38:00.639
He spent his life showing us

00:38:00.639 --> 00:38:03.960
how faith and hope begin with oneself

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.800
and then flow to others.

00:38:05.920 --> 00:38:08.679
He shared a better version of himself with us:

00:38:08.679 --> 00:38:09.719
Commitment,

00:38:09.719 --> 00:38:10.519
happiness,

00:38:10.519 --> 00:38:11.719
and love.

00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.840
May the deceased rest in peace, may the living strive forward.

00:38:16.199 --> 00:38:17.920
Alright, enough acting. Get up.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:18.920
Okay, stop.

00:38:20.199 --> 00:38:22.599
You really went all out with the ceremony.

00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:24.039
Must have cost a lot, right?

00:38:24.800 --> 00:38:25.760
So, Martin,

00:38:26.239 --> 00:38:27.159
As per your request,

00:38:27.159 --> 00:38:28.519
I got these choir kids

00:38:28.519 --> 00:38:30.119
and all these attendees back.

00:38:30.280 --> 00:38:31.199
Same people as before.

00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:32.440
Alright.

00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.639
Let them leave for now.

00:38:33.719 --> 00:38:34.760
At your service anytime.

00:38:35.880 --> 00:38:36.519
Everyone, let's go.

00:38:36.519 --> 00:38:37.159
Take a break.

00:38:37.159 --> 00:38:38.000
Thank you.

00:38:38.599 --> 00:38:42.199
Let's go get some water and snacks.

00:38:43.360 --> 00:38:44.079
See?

00:38:44.599 --> 00:38:46.639
Wanting to die is simple, isn't it?

00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:48.440
You can just lie down in this coffin,

00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:51.400
close your eyes, lid goes on,

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:53.000
and that's it.

00:38:53.519 --> 00:38:56.079
Or I can hold another one for you back in Beijing.

00:38:59.239 --> 00:38:59.880
Slow down.

00:39:03.719 --> 00:39:05.920
I really didn't expect you to still have these photos.

00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:08.719
That one.

00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:11.880
Back then, I was eight months old, you were six.

00:39:12.039 --> 00:39:13.800
My mom was holding you.

00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:15.440
Your mom was holding me.

00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:17.239
I remember my dad said,

00:39:17.440 --> 00:39:19.039
if you had been a girl back then,

00:39:19.199 --> 00:39:20.800
our families would've arranged a marriage.

00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.000
Good thing you weren't.

00:39:23.239 --> 00:39:23.960
This one.

00:39:28.159 --> 00:39:30.360
This was when Qiu'er turned one.

00:39:31.559 --> 00:39:34.159
We had a big feast at your place.

00:39:34.760 --> 00:39:37.360
Here, my dad, your dad, and Uncle Tong

00:39:37.360 --> 00:39:38.639
are chatting next door.

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:41.480
I remember this photo was taken by Auntie.

00:39:41.480 --> 00:39:42.559
Right after it was taken,

00:39:42.559 --> 00:39:44.039
Qiu'er peed all over the table.

00:39:56.719 --> 00:39:58.159
Don't rush, there's enough for everyone.

00:39:58.159 --> 00:39:59.480
There's enough.

00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:03.119
They're all mine, all mine!

00:40:03.119 --> 00:40:06.199
They're all mine!

00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:52.679
Here.

00:40:53.159 --> 00:40:53.840
Look at this.

00:40:53.840 --> 00:40:54.679
Come on, eat up.

00:40:55.320 --> 00:40:56.199
Why are you taking them all?

00:40:56.199 --> 00:40:57.159
Take them all, go ahead.

00:40:57.159 --> 00:40:57.639
Here.

00:40:58.519 --> 00:40:59.960
Give me two skewers.

00:41:01.840 --> 00:41:03.280
Eat this when you're hungry.

00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:04.679
Big Brother's cooking is great, right?

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.000
By the mountains and water,

00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:09.320
eating little skewers.

00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:10.199
Awesome.

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.320
Awesome.

00:41:31.519 --> 00:41:32.440
I'm going out for a bit.
