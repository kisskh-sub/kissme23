WEBVTT

00:01:51.519 --> 00:01:52.840
Hey, what are you doing?

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:55.120
Wait a moment.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:56.599
Excuse me.

00:01:56.959 --> 00:01:58.680
Miss Ye is Colonel Takeki's assistant.

00:01:58.799 --> 00:01:59.799
She is the Commander's guest.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.400
The Commander specifically emphasized

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:02.599
Miss Ye should feel at home here.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.280
This is Captain Akino Kawami of the anti-aircraft artillery squadron.

00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:33.680
This is Captain Akino Kawami of the anti-aircraft artillery squadron.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.400
This is Inspector Takeki from the Imperial Palace.

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.199
During his stay on the island, your squadron is under his command.

00:03:38.199 --> 00:03:39.159
During his stay on the island, your squadron is under his command.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:43.879
You must fully cooperate with the Colonel's investigation.

00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:44.719
Yes, sir.

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.800
I am honored to assist with the Colonel's investigation.

00:03:49.879 --> 00:03:50.599
I look forward to working with you.

00:03:50.759 --> 00:03:51.919
I look forward to working with you.

00:03:59.800 --> 00:04:00.840
This is my assistant,

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:02.120
Miss Ye Biying.

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:04.400
Pleased to meet you.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.120
Sanzao Island Special Police Unit,

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:41.199
Unit Commander Oshima.

00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:42.920
Reporting for duty once again.

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:45.040
Ah, Oshima, you're back.

00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:47.000
I just received the transfer notice

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.199
from Shanghai regarding you.

00:04:48.879 --> 00:04:49.839
With so many distinguished guests on the island,

00:04:49.839 --> 00:04:50.680
how could I neglect my duties?

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.959
I returned at the earliest opportunity.

00:04:56.120 --> 00:04:57.319
It's like this,

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.199
Colonel.

00:05:01.839 --> 00:05:02.839
Pleased to meet you.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.240
I am Oshima. I look forward to your guidance.

00:05:09.279 --> 00:05:10.079
I look forward to working with you.

00:05:11.279 --> 00:05:11.920
I heard that some of my men

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.519
acted inappropriately,

00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.480
disturbing you and your assistant,

00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:17.600
and even her family.

00:05:18.319 --> 00:05:19.600
I apologize to you on their behalf.

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:21.720
I understand.

00:05:22.240 --> 00:05:23.759
It is your duty.

00:05:24.079 --> 00:05:26.879
However, the methods were indeed somewhat improper.

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:29.199
My deputy commander was confined by you as a result.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.639
I believe your disciplinary decision was absolutely correct.

00:05:32.879 --> 00:05:35.079
Captain Inoue, in front of my assistant,

00:05:35.079 --> 00:05:37.199
attempted to assault her childhood friend.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.839
Thus, I had no choice but to administer a minor punishment as a warning.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:42.480
I hope Captain Oshima will not blame me.

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.639
Such a thing actually happened?

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:48.079
Inoue is far too arrogant.

00:05:48.879 --> 00:05:50.720
Someone should teach him a lesson.

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:52.920
For Inoue's recklessness and rudeness,

00:05:53.759 --> 00:05:57.839
I apologize to the Colonel and Miss Ye.

00:05:58.360 --> 00:05:59.360
I wonder if I might have the honor

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:00.120
of meeting your assistant?

00:06:00.759 --> 00:06:03.240
This is Miss Ye.

00:06:09.120 --> 00:06:09.600
Miss Ye.

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:11.720
Truly, the name suits the person.

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:14.839
Not at all like a dance hall girl.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:19.920
I heard

00:06:20.279 --> 00:06:22.879
you had a minor conflict with our police unit.

00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:23.920
A small misunderstanding.

00:06:24.879 --> 00:06:26.000
Please don't take it to heart.

00:06:28.319 --> 00:06:29.759
He says it was just a small misunderstanding.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:31.720
I'm sorry.

00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.040
I was out of line.

00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.240
Please forgive me.

00:06:47.519 --> 00:06:48.959
I wonder if I might have the honor

00:06:49.639 --> 00:06:51.839
of asking Miss Ye for a dance?

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.720
I really don't feel like dancing today.

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.600
Don't feel like dancing.

00:07:01.959 --> 00:07:04.959
That is truly a pity.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:08.319
It's rare for Captain Oshima to be in such a mood.

00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.879
You should do Captain Oshima this favor.

00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.519
Accompany Captain Oshima for one dance.

00:07:42.199 --> 00:07:44.920
Miss Ye, your dance steps seem quite rusty.

00:07:46.399 --> 00:07:47.959
Putting a gramophone here

00:07:47.959 --> 00:07:49.600
makes it feel like a real dance party.

00:07:50.319 --> 00:07:51.879
I, however, feel as if I'm

00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:53.720
dancing with a primitive person.

00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:56.639
Primitive people's dancing

00:07:57.519 --> 00:07:59.959
only involves banging on wood or washbasins.

00:08:00.879 --> 00:08:02.639
We are much better than them.

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:07.240
Ah.

00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:12.319
Captain Oshima is indeed not a good man,

00:08:12.839 --> 00:08:14.360
but he is a very competent captain.

00:08:15.839 --> 00:08:17.879
He is a bold, arrogant,

00:08:17.879 --> 00:08:21.519
brutal, yet cunning fellow.

00:08:21.959 --> 00:08:22.839
In his early years,

00:08:22.839 --> 00:08:24.720
he fought in the Battle of Nomonhan.

00:08:24.959 --> 00:08:25.560
Before the Battle of Nomonhan,

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:28.040
Oshima was ordered

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.639
to conduct deep reconnaissance into Mongolia.

00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:32.360
They flew into Russian airspace.

00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:35.000
The plane malfunctioned

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.879
and made a forced landing on the vast Mongolian steppe.

00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:40.080
The pilot was trembling with fear.

00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.159
He ordered the pilot to fix the plane immediately,

00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:44.720
then vanished into the night.

00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:47.399
He actually captured a Soviet sentry

00:08:48.039 --> 00:08:49.480
and flew him back to headquarters.

00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.000
Such audacity.

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:55.120
The conditions here are poor.

00:08:55.559 --> 00:08:56.799
When I was in Shanghai,

00:08:57.320 --> 00:09:00.840
I often went to your Cathay Dance Hall.

00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:03.600
The plump madam there

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:06.879
always introduced me to

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.600
the top girl named Honghong.

00:09:10.639 --> 00:09:12.320
That girl danced quite well

00:09:12.519 --> 00:09:15.559
and sang beautifully too.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:17.480
How do I remember

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.120
the madam at our dance hall being very thin,

00:09:20.639 --> 00:09:21.200
surnamed Li?

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.240
And the top girl?

00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.679
Wasn't named Honghong either.

00:09:25.639 --> 00:09:26.519
It was Fanny.

00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:29.080
Not only did she sing well,

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.480
but she also danced superbly.

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:34.240
As for your Honghong,

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.639
and the very plump madam,

00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:37.879
I don't recognize either of them.

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.600
In recent years, this man's footprints

00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:40.399
have been all over

00:09:40.399 --> 00:09:41.519
various battlefields.

00:09:42.799 --> 00:09:45.879
Later, he made the military police his profession.

00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:47.759
He enjoys killing—civilians,

00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.080
prisoners of war, even Imperial soldiers.

00:09:50.759 --> 00:09:52.039
Oshima doesn't smoke or drink,

00:09:52.039 --> 00:09:53.080
nor does he visit prostitutes.

00:09:55.039 --> 00:09:56.080
A year ago,

00:09:57.039 --> 00:09:58.559
he was transferred to Shanghai as the

00:09:58.799 --> 00:10:00.919
captain of the Special Police Unit.

00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:04.399
The commander of the Shanghai garrison

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.679
did not take Oshima seriously.

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.600
Afterwards, the commander paid a heavy price

00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:13.480
for that attitude.

00:10:14.759 --> 00:10:15.360
Oh.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:18.919
These naval officers and men,

00:10:19.799 --> 00:10:21.960
adrift at sea for long periods,

00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:24.759
rush to find outlets the moment they come ashore.

00:10:25.679 --> 00:10:27.759
Prostitution and rape cases are endless.

00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.480
The Special Police Unit's detention cells

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.600
were filled with these disciplinary offenders.

00:10:34.120 --> 00:10:37.960
Oshima didn't even spare the commander's face.

00:10:38.919 --> 00:10:41.360
He arrested more and more people.

00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.799
Even more darn it, not long after,

00:10:48.120 --> 00:10:49.519
Oshima caught

00:10:49.519 --> 00:10:51.559
the commander's confidant, Finance Officer Major Sugihara Kiyo,

00:10:51.559 --> 00:10:52.879
with evidence of embezzlement. Sugihara Kiyo

00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:56.039
was even driven to shoot himself.

00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.799
To get rid of this troublesome figure,

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.360
the Shanghai commander racked his brains,

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.480
always trying to push him back to me.

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.919
In the end, I agreed, on the condition

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:08.759
of receiving two additional torpedo boats.

00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:10.279
Only recently

00:11:10.279 --> 00:11:12.080
did he move this 'Buddha' to Sanzao Island.

00:11:15.639 --> 00:11:18.480
Listening to Fujita's casual introduction,

00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.879
Takeki knew well

00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:20.879
that this man

00:11:21.039 --> 00:11:22.879
was a seasoned,

00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.559
cunning, and vicious old wolf.

00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:29.919
He had already sunk his claws deep into

00:11:29.919 --> 00:11:32.039
the soil of Sanzao Island.

00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.480
He silently reminded himself

00:11:34.759 --> 00:11:37.759
that he had met a true adversary.

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.600
Mr. Oshima,

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:47.200
why are your hands quicker than your heart?

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:48.679
My apologies.

00:11:51.679 --> 00:11:52.840
Miss Ye's beauty

00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.080
is hard to refuse.

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:59.279
No wonder Colonel Takeki takes you everywhere.

00:12:06.360 --> 00:12:06.919
Miss Ye,

00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:09.159
you truly have discerning eyes,

00:12:10.639 --> 00:12:13.159
becoming the Colonel's lover.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:14.759
This way,

00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:15.879
no matter where you are,

00:12:16.039 --> 00:12:18.080
you can enjoy the greatest convenience.

00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:20.080
To me,

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.639
Takeki is just Takeki.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.039
He is not a Colonel.

00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:25.600
That's a rare way of thinking.

00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:27.960
However,

00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:32.480
your father, Ye Degong,

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:33.960
probably doesn't feel

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:36.159
that Takeki is just Takeki, right?

00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:39.840
That matter is my own private family affair.

00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:41.879
No need for Captain Oshima

00:12:41.879 --> 00:12:42.720
to trouble himself over it.

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.120
Don't be so formal.

00:12:45.279 --> 00:12:46.720
Our Commander Fujita

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:50.519
served as a diplomat in America.

00:12:51.799 --> 00:12:52.559
Therefore,

00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:56.679
such a private party feels particularly authentic.

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:57.679
Right?

00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:00.679
By the way,

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.120
have you ever met any Americans?

00:13:06.679 --> 00:13:07.559
Americans?

00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:27.000
The Captain may not know,

00:13:27.399 --> 00:13:29.200
Miss Ye grew up in America.

00:13:29.639 --> 00:13:31.240
So she knows more Americans than anyone.

00:13:31.679 --> 00:13:32.840
But I'm curious,

00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.120
why are you asking her that?

00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:37.600
My apologies,

00:13:38.519 --> 00:13:40.120
but I must reclaim my beautiful dance partner.

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.039
That scared me to death.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:56.759
Keep smiling.

00:13:57.799 --> 00:13:59.039
He was deliberately testing you.

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:00.720
Don't reveal any flaws.

00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:04.039
I was controlling myself very hard.

00:14:05.639 --> 00:14:07.159
Stop with the pointless regret.

00:14:08.279 --> 00:14:09.600
For now, my cover identity

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.240
still has some deterrent effect on him.

00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:14.279
But you must promise me

00:14:15.039 --> 00:14:16.720
you won't make the same mistake tonight.

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:19.960
I'll try.

00:14:20.559 --> 00:14:22.039
It seems our special training is effective.

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.519
At least when we dance,

00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:26.159
it's much more natural than before.

00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.519
I heard

00:14:34.519 --> 00:14:37.320
the hostesses at Shanghai's Cathay Ballroom

00:14:37.919 --> 00:14:39.600
are all talented singers and dancers.

00:14:40.919 --> 00:14:41.279
Miss Ye

00:14:41.279 --> 00:14:42.519
won't you entertain us with a song?

00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:43.679
Miss Ye

00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:45.480
please.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.559
Will you sing a song for them?

00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:49.320
Thank you.

00:14:53.159 --> 00:14:53.600
What's wrong?

00:14:54.759 --> 00:14:55.159
Shy?

00:14:57.080 --> 00:14:57.519
(Applause)

00:15:42.879 --> 00:15:47.960
Is this a dream?

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:53.639
Drifting on the tide

00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.200
down the River Styx.

00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:03.320
Oh, is this a dream?

00:16:06.039 --> 00:16:11.600
Mist hangs on the horizon,

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:19.919
strange lights flicker in the sky.

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.519
No one seems to know where you're bound.

00:16:26.600 --> 00:16:29.559
What does it mean?

00:16:30.279 --> 00:16:35.039
Oh, is this a dream?

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.360
Bright eyes

00:16:40.759 --> 00:16:44.840
shining like fire.

00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:00.639
(Salute)

00:17:03.559 --> 00:17:04.240
I had a good time today.

00:17:05.039 --> 00:17:06.400
Thank you, everyone.

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.599
See you next time.

00:17:11.400 --> 00:17:11.799
Fukuda

00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:12.519
Yes?

00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:14.599
Don't do anything bad.

00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:15.640
I won't.

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:18.599
Let's go.

00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.559
The moon is so full tonight.

00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:28.400
Sasaki

00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:31.359
That woman is definitely not a dancer.

00:17:32.319 --> 00:17:33.279
Send a telegram immediately when we get back.

00:17:33.279 --> 00:17:34.559
Tell Inoue to investigate.

00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:35.279
Understood?

00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:37.480
Yes.

00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:40.720
The weather is really nice.

00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:50.160
Let me introduce you.

00:17:51.039 --> 00:17:53.000
This is Captain Akino Kawami of the Anti-Aircraft Artillery Unit.

00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:55.039
Commander Fujita has given the order.

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.480
From today, he will fully cooperate with my work.

00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:05.079
The Anti-Aircraft Artillery Unit is at your service.

00:18:06.519 --> 00:18:07.160
Tell me,

00:18:07.839 --> 00:18:09.480
what is daily life like on the island?

00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:17.640
The missions our unit carries out

00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:26.640
mostly involve staring at the sky.

00:18:30.319 --> 00:18:31.920
Once you come to Sanzao Island,

00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:33.839
aside from

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:38.200
some troublemakers from other islands,

00:18:38.799 --> 00:18:43.079
this island is so peaceful

00:18:43.079 --> 00:18:46.480
it makes you forget we're at war.

00:18:47.759 --> 00:18:48.559
In that case,

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.240
you've never shot down a plane?

00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:52.680
Not exactly.

00:18:54.359 --> 00:18:55.160
A while ago,

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.920
an American plane happened

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.519
to enter our airspace.

00:19:01.039 --> 00:19:03.720
We shot it down immediately.

00:19:04.799 --> 00:19:06.839
Oh, that's impressive.

00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:08.279
You even shot down an American plane.

00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:08.960
Yes.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:14.720
And there were three Americans in the plane.

00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:17.039
Because of this,

00:19:17.039 --> 00:19:18.799
Tokyo headquarters even sent commendations.

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.400
But the strange thing is,

00:19:23.039 --> 00:19:24.200
the police unit says

00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:29.920
there should have been a fourth American.

00:19:33.079 --> 00:19:37.680
Those guys are too eager for credit.

00:20:18.079 --> 00:20:19.000
Let's sort this out.

00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.279
An American transport plane

00:20:22.279 --> 00:20:24.480
was shot down by us over Sanzao Island airspace.

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:27.039
Three of the four crew members died.

00:20:27.839 --> 00:20:29.200
One is missing.

00:20:30.559 --> 00:20:31.799
It's now confirmed that one survived

00:20:31.799 --> 00:20:32.359
and is highly likely

00:20:32.359 --> 00:20:33.000
to have landed on the island and gone into hiding.

00:20:34.359 --> 00:20:35.599
Right at this time,

00:20:36.319 --> 00:20:37.400
a special envoy from the Imperial Palace suddenly arrived on the island.

00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:38.400
A special envoy from the Imperial Palace suddenly arrived on the island.

00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:40.480
He also brought back

00:20:42.480 --> 00:20:44.119
a suspicious woman claiming to be his assistant.

00:20:45.240 --> 00:20:47.960
And this woman is none other than Ye Degong's daughter.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:49.839
Yes, you are correct.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:54.960
Not long after this envoy arrived,

00:20:56.119 --> 00:20:59.519
a sentry from the airport garrison went missing.

00:21:00.319 --> 00:21:02.039
Could this be related to the Colonel?

00:21:03.119 --> 00:21:05.480
Before we find evidence,

00:21:06.039 --> 00:21:07.319
everything is just suspicion, not conclusion.

00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:09.480
Sasaki

00:21:10.279 --> 00:21:10.519
Yes.

00:21:11.519 --> 00:21:12.079
I'll ask you three questions.

00:21:13.680 --> 00:21:14.319
First,

00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:17.079
what was this American plane here for?

00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:18.279
Second,

00:21:19.799 --> 00:21:20.960
what is this Colonel

00:21:20.960 --> 00:21:22.799
doing at the 6th Air Base?

00:21:23.279 --> 00:21:24.240
Third, what is a Chinese woman like this

00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.640
doing here?

00:21:26.359 --> 00:21:26.799
Can you answer?

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:29.559
I apologize for my incompetence.

00:21:30.279 --> 00:21:31.960
We are still investigating.

00:21:34.200 --> 00:21:35.200
No hurry.

00:21:36.839 --> 00:21:37.680
We still have time.

00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:39.400
Perhaps these three questions

00:21:39.519 --> 00:21:41.759
are actually the same question.

00:21:44.319 --> 00:21:45.640
You must be tired from your journey today.

00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:46.559
You must be exhausted.

00:21:47.039 --> 00:21:48.240
You should rest early.

00:21:48.839 --> 00:21:49.480
Alright.

00:21:51.039 --> 00:21:52.519
You're mistaken, Sasaki.

00:21:54.039 --> 00:21:55.319
I'm more alert now than ever.

00:21:55.839 --> 00:21:58.359
This feeling is like discovering prey.

00:22:00.839 --> 00:22:02.319
I will absolutely not let this go.

00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:05.319
We must strike first.

00:22:06.079 --> 00:22:09.640
You're right, we must strike first.

00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.720
We have two leads.

00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:15.920
First, the islanders' hidden rooms.

00:22:16.599 --> 00:22:19.079
Second, that woman named Ye Biying.

00:22:20.240 --> 00:22:21.599
Regarding the hidden rooms,

00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.240
Inoue asked Tang Bingchen from the Maintenance Association.

00:22:24.759 --> 00:22:25.359
He said

00:22:25.359 --> 00:22:26.240
each household builds their hidden room

00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.519
by hiring people from off the island.

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:29.680
No household knows

00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:30.799
where another family's hidden room is.

00:22:31.720 --> 00:22:33.640
As for that woman,

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:36.359
should we ask Shanghai for assistance in the investigation?

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:36.960
No.

00:22:37.799 --> 00:22:38.519
Do not alert Shanghai garrison intelligence.

00:22:38.519 --> 00:22:38.880
Do not alert Shanghai garrison intelligence.

00:22:41.519 --> 00:22:47.400
Have the Inoue Residence investigate from the side.

00:22:47.880 --> 00:22:48.920
Understood.

00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:52.480
Bring Tang Bingchen to me again.

00:22:53.920 --> 00:22:54.720
Yes, sir.

00:22:55.240 --> 00:22:57.200
Captain, the documents are organized.

00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.640
Captain.

00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:18.000
Well done.

00:23:18.839 --> 00:23:19.720
What do you think, Sasaki?

00:23:30.079 --> 00:23:30.599
Captain Akino,

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:31.880
you go back and rest first.

00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.319
I still need to escort Miss Ye home.

00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.640
Then I'll take my leave.

00:23:43.759 --> 00:23:45.000
Thank you for today.

00:24:05.759 --> 00:24:06.519
I'm coming in.

00:24:07.079 --> 00:24:07.519
Come in.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:09.640
Tang Bingchen is here.

00:24:16.880 --> 00:24:18.200
Long time no see, Chairman.

00:24:23.039 --> 00:24:23.799
Captain Oshima.

00:24:25.079 --> 00:24:25.880
You're back.

00:24:27.839 --> 00:24:28.480
You two, step outside.

00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:29.880
Yes.

00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:31.160
We'll take our leave.

00:24:37.519 --> 00:24:38.000
Chairman.

00:24:38.839 --> 00:24:40.359
During my absence...

00:24:40.799 --> 00:24:43.160
...have you been serving us well?

00:24:45.279 --> 00:24:46.119
Captain Oshima...

00:24:46.559 --> 00:24:47.160
Well...

00:24:48.519 --> 00:24:49.359
Our Maintenance Association...

00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:52.680
...has always been wholeheartedly loyal to the Police Brigade.

00:24:53.319 --> 00:24:54.200
You can rest assured.

00:24:56.359 --> 00:24:56.839
Chairman.

00:24:57.519 --> 00:24:58.000
Have a seat.

00:24:59.599 --> 00:24:59.839
I...

00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:01.960
...I'd better stand.

00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:03.039
Sit.

00:25:03.599 --> 00:25:05.880
It hurts my neck to talk to you like this.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:07.559
Just sit down.

00:25:07.799 --> 00:25:08.519
Alright.

00:25:19.799 --> 00:25:20.759
Your loyalty...

00:25:22.079 --> 00:25:23.200
...I don't doubt.

00:25:24.920 --> 00:25:26.279
But what about your daughter?

00:25:27.079 --> 00:25:28.359
Huh? What about her?

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:37.920
You know our deputy captain, Inoue?

00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:39.839
He...

00:25:40.519 --> 00:25:43.319
...specially sought out your daughter for routine questioning.

00:25:45.519 --> 00:25:46.480
If she didn't want to talk, fine.

00:25:47.119 --> 00:25:47.759
But...

00:25:48.759 --> 00:25:49.839
She even went and complained...

00:25:49.839 --> 00:25:50.960
...to that Colonel Takeki who just arrived on the island.

00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.519
Complained to Colonel Takeki.

00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.200
Slandering Inoue...

00:25:56.079 --> 00:25:57.480
...of attempting to rape her.

00:26:01.119 --> 00:26:02.079
As a result, Inoue...

00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:05.000
...was confined by the Colonel.

00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.720
He's still in the brig.

00:26:08.559 --> 00:26:10.880
He's been shouting...

00:26:11.759 --> 00:26:14.160
...that once he's out, he'll settle the score with your daughter.

00:26:15.240 --> 00:26:17.960
Captain Oshima, I beg you!

00:26:18.759 --> 00:26:20.480
My daughter is young and ignorant!

00:26:20.680 --> 00:26:22.519
Please, have Captain Inoue let her off!

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:25.519
All these years...

00:26:25.839 --> 00:26:26.640
...my daughter and I...

00:26:26.880 --> 00:26:28.759
...have served you wholeheartedly.

00:26:28.759 --> 00:26:29.559
Never a disloyal thought.

00:26:29.559 --> 00:26:32.200
Please, tell Captain Inoue to spare her!

00:26:32.279 --> 00:26:33.519
There's nothing I can do.

00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:35.319
Because that's just how he is.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:37.680
He doesn't submit to anyone.

00:26:38.319 --> 00:26:39.279
He fears no one.

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:40.279
No, no!

00:26:41.319 --> 00:26:43.160
He listens to you! He respects you!

00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.920
Whatever you need me, Tang Bingchen, to do...

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:48.480
...I'll do my absolute best!

00:26:50.039 --> 00:26:50.480
Chairman.

00:26:50.799 --> 00:26:51.480
Don't worry.

00:26:52.319 --> 00:26:54.759
I don't approve of such crude actions either.

00:26:56.079 --> 00:26:56.640
Thank you.

00:26:56.720 --> 00:26:58.240
Thank you, Captain Oshima.

00:27:05.279 --> 00:27:06.279
Since returning, I've heard...

00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:10.599
...that the wealthy families on this island...

00:27:10.759 --> 00:27:13.240
...all have secret rooms, right?

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:16.079
Yes, that's true.

00:27:17.319 --> 00:27:19.319
So where are these secret rooms located?

00:27:20.319 --> 00:27:21.240
Captain Oshima...

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.200
...I truly don't know that.

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:28.119
If I'm lying...

00:27:28.759 --> 00:27:29.640
...may I die a horrible death.

00:27:30.319 --> 00:27:30.839
Hmm.

00:27:31.759 --> 00:27:32.519
I believe you.

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:38.160
Does anyone else know?

00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.279
Each family only knows their own.

00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:43.240
They have no idea about others'.

00:27:43.759 --> 00:27:44.759
Secret rooms, secret rooms...

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.599
...are for storing valuables and jewelry.

00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.480
You can't let others know about them.

00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:50.880
That makes sense.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.480
Who built the houses?

00:27:54.079 --> 00:27:55.599
They hired people from off the island.

00:27:56.039 --> 00:27:57.160
They left after finishing the work.

00:27:57.759 --> 00:27:58.319
From off the island.

00:27:59.759 --> 00:28:00.519
So...

00:28:01.599 --> 00:28:03.119
...no one from the island was involved?

00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.960
When the houses were being built...

00:28:08.359 --> 00:28:09.359
Well, that...

00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:10.960
It's fine.

00:28:11.839 --> 00:28:12.640
Go back and think it over slowly.

00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:16.839
You may leave.

00:28:25.559 --> 00:28:28.680
Inoue will be out by tonight anyway.

00:28:36.319 --> 00:28:37.039
Captain Oshima!

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:39.000
I remember now!

00:28:39.119 --> 00:28:40.200
There's a fortune-teller on the island.

00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:42.759
When the builders were more particular...

00:28:42.759 --> 00:28:43.640
...they would ask him to check the feng shui.

00:28:43.799 --> 00:28:45.519
He might know a thing or two!

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:53.279
Are you talking about...

00:28:53.960 --> 00:28:55.599
...that old man west of Tanjia Bay?

00:28:55.599 --> 00:28:56.799
That old man?

00:28:58.519 --> 00:28:58.960
Right?

00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:05.119
Ah!

00:29:16.119 --> 00:29:16.759
Sasaki!

00:29:20.519 --> 00:29:21.519
Go release Captain Inoue.

00:29:21.799 --> 00:29:22.359
Yes, sir!

00:29:28.799 --> 00:29:29.640
You understand.

00:29:30.039 --> 00:29:30.920
It's alright.

00:29:31.519 --> 00:29:33.359
We need to find that old man.

00:29:35.839 --> 00:29:36.079
Thank you.

00:29:36.519 --> 00:29:37.200
Thank you for your cooperation.

00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:03.240
Some fortune-teller you are.

00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.200
You couldn't even foresee your own capture.

00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:06.000
Get him!

00:30:07.119 --> 00:30:07.480
Go!

00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:27.960
What were you two jabbering about...

00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.000
...later on?

00:30:30.559 --> 00:30:32.039
The island's Special Police Brigade...

00:30:32.039 --> 00:30:33.920
...already knows there was a fourth person on the plane.

00:30:34.079 --> 00:30:35.640
This is a very dangerous sign.

00:30:36.119 --> 00:30:38.039
We must locate the Major as soon as possible.

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.319
So tonight...

00:30:39.359 --> 00:30:39.880
I know.

00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:41.839
I must go back and talk properly with Fourth Aunt...

00:30:41.839 --> 00:30:43.079
...and Dad, right?

00:30:44.519 --> 00:30:44.839
Yes.

00:30:46.240 --> 00:30:47.519
Your father is a diplomat.

00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:49.480
This matter shouldn't be difficult.

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:50.799
But tonight...

00:30:50.799 --> 00:30:51.960
...you saw and heard it yourself.

00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.200
For your piano...

00:30:53.359 --> 00:30:54.519
...and to wait for you to come home...

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.200
...he was actually willing to beg Fujita.

00:30:57.599 --> 00:30:58.720
A father like that...

00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:01.519
...will never accept our relationship.

00:31:04.559 --> 00:31:05.599
Then what should we do?

00:31:06.640 --> 00:31:07.720
Although the situation is urgent...

00:31:08.599 --> 00:31:09.680
...I hope you'll be patient.

00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.160
I'll come first thing tomorrow morning.

00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.559
If it really comes to it...

00:31:17.559 --> 00:31:18.759
...I'll just tell them directly.

00:31:19.079 --> 00:31:20.160
Try to earn his trust.

00:31:25.559 --> 00:31:26.279
Get some rest.

00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:27.680
Mm-hmm.

00:31:29.799 --> 00:31:30.119
Hey.

00:31:31.519 --> 00:31:32.240
You sing well.

00:31:34.799 --> 00:31:35.720
And you dance nicely too.

00:31:57.599 --> 00:31:58.319
Fourth Aunt

00:31:58.559 --> 00:31:58.880
Oh

00:31:59.319 --> 00:32:00.519
Biying, you're back!

00:32:01.519 --> 00:32:02.160
Where's my dad?

00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:04.000
Is he in a good mood today?

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:05.279
I need to talk to him.

00:32:05.839 --> 00:32:07.960
Your dad and your brother went out.

00:32:08.519 --> 00:32:09.160
They went out.

00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:09.680
Huh?

00:32:10.599 --> 00:32:11.519
Where did they go?

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:14.240
How would I know?

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:15.759
Auntie.

00:32:17.279 --> 00:32:18.559
Look me in the eyes.

00:32:18.799 --> 00:32:19.759
Where did they go?

00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:20.799
Oh dear.

00:32:21.519 --> 00:32:23.119
My little ancestor.

00:32:23.200 --> 00:32:23.519
You...

00:32:24.279 --> 00:32:25.920
You've been afraid of your dad since you were little.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.240
So you just bully your old auntie.

00:32:27.359 --> 00:32:29.720
How could I possibly know where they went?

00:32:30.519 --> 00:32:32.279
It's fine if you won't say.

00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:36.799
I'll find them myself.

00:32:42.279 --> 00:32:44.160
Dad, do you think that spot is okay?

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:45.200
Let's go with that one.

00:32:50.599 --> 00:32:51.480
Biying.

00:32:51.759 --> 00:32:53.119
Goodness, in the middle of the night.

00:32:53.559 --> 00:32:54.839
What are you looking for?

00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:56.920
Looking for the person you've hidden.

00:32:57.079 --> 00:32:57.680
What?

00:32:58.000 --> 00:32:59.000
What are you...

00:32:59.240 --> 00:33:00.720
What nonsense are you talking?

00:33:01.759 --> 00:33:03.480
Whatever you do, don't tell your sister about this.

00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:03.759
Sigh.

00:33:18.759 --> 00:33:19.319
Ying'er.

00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:22.200
Dad.

00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:23.519
Yes.

00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:27.000
You're back.

00:33:27.200 --> 00:33:27.720
Sigh.

00:33:29.279 --> 00:33:31.599
I need to talk to you.

00:33:38.279 --> 00:33:39.119
Beautiful.

00:33:39.799 --> 00:33:40.960
Your mother really knew how to have children.

00:33:41.920 --> 00:33:42.880
Even prettier than she was.

00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:46.240
What did you say?

00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.039
I need to talk to you.

00:33:49.559 --> 00:33:50.200
Come with me.

00:33:55.759 --> 00:33:56.759
When did you get these?

00:33:57.119 --> 00:33:57.680
Today.

00:33:58.920 --> 00:33:59.759
Beautiful.

00:34:00.319 --> 00:34:01.839
Much prettier than his last one.

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:02.759
Go on.

00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:04.799
Fourth Aunt.

00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:05.200
Hm?

00:34:05.759 --> 00:34:06.480
Don't go.

00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:08.480
Let father and daughter have a proper talk.

00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:09.480
Oh.

00:34:09.519 --> 00:34:10.800
You rest, it's fine.

00:34:22.519 --> 00:34:23.599
What did you want to talk to me about?

00:34:24.360 --> 00:34:24.960
Go ahead.

00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:27.079
Beautiful.

00:34:28.559 --> 00:34:30.480
Even prettier than the last pair.

00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:47.840
Go on.

00:34:48.239 --> 00:34:48.880
Alright.

00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:50.719
Put them on, put them on.

00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.760
They look even prettier on.

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:03.519
Fine. Go ahead, what is it?

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:05.840
Dad.

00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:06.239
Mm-hmm.

00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:10.719
Has anyone been coming to the house lately?

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:16.519
The Japanese have been here plenty.

00:35:18.599 --> 00:35:19.360
And?

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:21.519
Takeki.

00:35:23.599 --> 00:35:24.480
And?

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:26.559
No one else.

00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:28.800
No.

00:35:29.519 --> 00:35:30.920
Then what were you doing out so late?

00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:32.599
You, every single day...

00:35:32.599 --> 00:35:34.719
...going in and out with a Japanese man.

00:35:35.320 --> 00:35:37.000
The villagers are all gossiping now.

00:35:37.519 --> 00:35:38.719
Forcing me and your brother...

00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:41.519
...to have to explain things to the villagers.

00:35:41.719 --> 00:35:43.920
Where do you think I went?

00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:46.960
Hmm?

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:48.920
I know you're the best to me, right?

00:35:52.519 --> 00:35:52.840
Alright.

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:53.360
Dad.

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:53.840
Mm-hmm.

00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:57.079
I saw the piano.

00:35:58.199 --> 00:35:59.800
Thank you for keeping it for me.

00:36:06.079 --> 00:36:06.760
Good.

00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:11.960
You met Fujita?

00:36:15.119 --> 00:36:15.480
Yes.

00:36:16.599 --> 00:36:18.039
Stay away from those people.

00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:19.519
Understand?

00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:21.719
I understand.

00:36:23.159 --> 00:36:23.599
Good.

00:36:26.239 --> 00:36:28.519
Is that all you wanted to ask?

00:36:32.079 --> 00:36:33.039
Nothing else?

00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:34.159
Mm-hmm.

00:36:35.639 --> 00:36:36.960
Good, then get some rest.

00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:40.559
And also...

00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:41.239
What?

00:36:43.199 --> 00:36:43.800
Comfortable?

00:36:45.079 --> 00:36:45.519
The glasses.

00:36:49.559 --> 00:36:50.599
The new ones.

00:36:52.239 --> 00:36:53.599
A bit tight.

00:36:55.280 --> 00:36:55.719
Tight?

00:37:02.599 --> 00:37:03.519
I mean...

00:37:04.280 --> 00:37:06.039
...you seemed happy wearing them.

00:37:30.119 --> 00:37:30.880
We got him.

00:37:33.639 --> 00:37:34.719
Welcome.

00:37:38.639 --> 00:37:40.079
We've been waiting.

00:37:41.719 --> 00:37:42.719
Old man.

00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:46.840
Do you want to die, or live?

00:37:46.840 --> 00:37:48.559
Do good deeds, accumulate years.

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:51.000
All matters will be peaceful.

00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:51.519
Hey.

00:37:52.800 --> 00:37:53.559
Old man.

00:37:54.559 --> 00:37:57.000
I hear you're a fortune-teller.

00:37:58.519 --> 00:37:59.360
Then tell me...

00:38:01.519 --> 00:38:04.199
...if you'll walk out of here alive.

00:38:06.519 --> 00:38:08.000
Yin and yang.

00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:09.800
Yin and yang never cease.

00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:10.800
Affairs of wind and moon.

00:38:11.079 --> 00:38:12.719
Good and evil.

00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.119
Good, evil...

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:16.639
Stop, I get it.

00:38:17.559 --> 00:38:18.360
Let's do this instead.

00:38:20.280 --> 00:38:23.000
Tell my fortune for me.

00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:32.119
You want me to tell...

00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.719
...your fortune?

00:38:39.159 --> 00:38:40.000
What are you doing?

00:38:42.719 --> 00:38:43.559
Your hand.

00:38:44.039 --> 00:38:44.599
Hand.

00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:45.079
Mm-hmm.

00:38:45.880 --> 00:38:46.480
Left or right?

00:38:46.519 --> 00:38:46.880
Mm-hmm.

00:38:49.039 --> 00:38:49.880
Left for men.

00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:02.159
Sir.

00:39:02.639 --> 00:39:04.960
I cannot read your fortune.

00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:06.880
Why?

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:11.519
Do you wish to hear the truth...

00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.239
...or do you wish to hear lies?

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.519
He actually still wants to tell lies.

00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.519
It's the first time I've heard someone ask me

00:39:28.719 --> 00:39:31.000
if I want to hear lies.

00:39:34.920 --> 00:39:37.159
Of course I want to hear the truth.

00:39:38.679 --> 00:39:40.159
Your forehead is dark.

00:39:41.199 --> 00:39:43.000
I fear an unforeseen disaster awaits you.

00:39:46.239 --> 00:39:47.360
What are you talking about?

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:49.920
All the evil karma created in the past

00:39:50.559 --> 00:39:51.840
stems from beginningless

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:53.559
greed, hatred, and delusion.

00:39:53.719 --> 00:39:54.519
Old fool!

00:39:55.159 --> 00:39:56.480
What does this mean?

00:39:57.159 --> 00:39:57.719
Sir!

00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:00.599
A person's eyes belong to the fire element.

00:40:01.559 --> 00:40:03.519
The mouth and ears belong to water.

00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:05.679
The nose belongs to earth.

00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:07.039
The forehead belongs to wood.

00:40:08.159 --> 00:40:09.719
Your eyes leak a murderous glint.

00:40:10.360 --> 00:40:11.519
Your fire energy is too excessive.

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:14.840
In the future, you will surely meet disaster by fire.

00:40:16.239 --> 00:40:17.480
How annoying!

00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:21.519
Stop!

00:40:31.639 --> 00:40:32.880
What are you all doing?

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:38.199
To this frail old man...

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:40.480
He won't live much longer anyway.

00:40:49.719 --> 00:40:50.679
Let him sit down.

00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:51.360
Yes, sir.

00:40:59.079 --> 00:40:59.719
All of you, withdraw.

00:41:00.239 --> 00:41:00.840
Yes, sir.

00:41:10.519 --> 00:41:11.840
I'm sorry, old sir.

00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:18.320
Today,

00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:20.480
the reason we invited you is

00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:23.000
we want to build a courtyard.

00:41:24.079 --> 00:41:24.840
However,

00:41:25.880 --> 00:41:27.360
we truly don't understand these matters.

00:41:28.119 --> 00:41:28.719
Therefore,

00:41:30.199 --> 00:41:32.199
please help us check the feng shui.

00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:40.480
My subordinate's lack of manners...

00:41:42.679 --> 00:41:43.760
I am truly sorry.

00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:46.159
Apologize to him.

00:41:48.639 --> 00:41:49.960
I'm sorry.

00:41:59.639 --> 00:42:00.599
This rough sketch...

00:42:01.880 --> 00:42:04.000
This is the courtyard.

00:42:04.480 --> 00:42:07.480
Then this front hall,

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:09.360
the rear hall.

00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:12.840
The key point is,

00:42:14.079 --> 00:42:15.960
we need to, within this courtyard,

00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:17.360
construct a

00:42:18.880 --> 00:42:20.159
secret underground room.

00:42:20.719 --> 00:42:21.599
Right here.
