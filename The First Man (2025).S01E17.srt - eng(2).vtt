00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.770
You'll be able to achieve
your dream soon enough,

00:00:02.840 --> 00:00:07.210
- so please try not to be so impatient.
- When? When is that going to be?

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.980
With that old fox stabbing me in the back,
just when is that supposed to happen?

00:00:16.620 --> 00:00:17.660
Just you wait.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.960
I'm going to take over all of Dream!

00:00:26.260 --> 00:00:28.930
(Episode 17)

00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:30.370
Hold on.

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.210
Gosh, that's hot!

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.610
Oh, no. My mistake.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:40.680
Director Ma!

00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:45.280
I said it was an accident.
Don't you ever make mistakes?

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.050
What's with the death glare?

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.790
I know perfectly well
you spilled that on me on purpose.

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:56.060
It won't kill you. Don't be so dramatic.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:00.470
You know, you're quite a little actress.

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.870
Did you put on that "resigning" act
just to pull off this stunt today?

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:05.940
The Chairman told me not to say anything.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.610
I see.

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:11.210
What, are you bragging now
that you've got my grandpa in your corner?

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.610
Does it look like I'm bragging?

00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.720
You saw it with your own two eyes,
didn't you?

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.650
At Chang Restaurant.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.360
You saw how Grandpa flipped out
at what I said.

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.460
He can't just ignore what I say.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.930
So you'd better tell your mother.

00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.470
Tell her not to get her hopes up
about marrying into my family.

00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:39.670
Got it?

00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.510
I'll get this.
I'm the one with the money, after all.

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.680
Why don't you finish your coffee?

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:55.290
Ma Seo Rin.

00:01:56.590 --> 00:01:58.160
You'll find out soon enough.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:03.030
That it won't be long
until my mom becomes your grandmother.

00:02:04.460 --> 00:02:05.600
Both my mom and I...

00:02:06.460 --> 00:02:08.200
have staked our whole lives on that day.

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:12.100
Today is the last day
I let you cross the line.

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.410
All right, Singer Oh. Eat up, okay?

00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:24.120
Dad, what's the special occasion?

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.690
Singer Oh? I like it.
You're Singer Oh now!

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.790
Tae Pyung can sing. Tae Pyung's a singer!

00:02:32.990 --> 00:02:35.830
But thanks to you, Mom,
no one even got to see me sing.

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.930
- Dream Hotel's CEO was there too.
- The CEO of Dream Hotel was?

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:42.770
Yes. She's my generous sponsor.

00:02:42.830 --> 00:02:46.200
Really?
We should have gone and thanked her.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.570
I feel so bad about that.

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:48.770
Dad.

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.040
Why don't I bring her
one of our lunch boxes later?

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:54.310
A lunch box? You think that'd be okay?

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.350
That's a great idea.
I mean, the CEO has to eat too, right?

00:02:58.620 --> 00:03:01.820
Right. Someone like her
probably has a refined palate,

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:04.090
and I'm not sure
if she'll like our lunch boxes,

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:06.820
but if she doesn't want it,
I guess she can just give it to her staff.

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:08.090
Exactly, Dad.

00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:12.600
By the way, Singer Oh,
that live music bar must be pretty famous.

00:03:13.060 --> 00:03:14.230
My Jang Mi is gone.

00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:17.300
- Jang Mi!
- It's okay, Suk Hee. She will be back.

00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.270
What's taking her so long?

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.610
I saw one of our regular customers there.

00:03:29.980 --> 00:03:32.580
Would you like me to get you some tea
to help you calm down?

00:03:37.060 --> 00:03:38.060
(Professor Kang sent a photo.)

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.300
Go right now and find out
what position he gave Jin Hong Ju.

00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.360
That old man.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:51.200
He wouldn't dare promote Jin Hong Ju
to team leader or manager, would he?

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:53.570
Right away.

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:54.940
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:03:59.010 --> 00:04:01.480
I just can't let my guard down
for a second.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:12.660
The white clouds in the blue sky
look just like angels.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.930
They look just like you, you know?

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000
I miss you.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:24.000
He has a surprisingly naive side to him.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:27.710
And a bit of a romantic streak too.

00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:34.450
He's my only source of comfort.

00:04:43.590 --> 00:04:46.060
So what if Ma Seo Rin
joins the opposition?

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.330
You think the Chairman
would even bat an eye?

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.000
The problem is that it'll take time.

00:04:52.730 --> 00:04:55.100
Gosh, I just want to crush
that little brat.

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:58.200
Then I'd feel like
I could finally breathe again.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:00.870
You're right. Goodness.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.040
Just think of all the tears you've cried
over that little nobody, Seo Rin.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:05.510
Enough to fill an ocean.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:09.250
The way she mocked, belittled,
and tormented me...

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:12.520
Once you marry the Chairman,

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:14.320
I'll make her pay
for every last bit of it.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.660
I'll make her suffer, piece by piece.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:19.890
That's right, sweetie.

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.130
I'll get them back for all your suffering
in one fell swoop.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:29.300
So, how am I going to wrap that old man
around my little finger?

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:41.580
Hello?

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:44.620
Chairman, it's Hong Ju.

00:05:44.950 --> 00:05:47.550
Hi. Did you get home all right?

00:05:50.220 --> 00:05:51.420
Something awful has happened.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:53.490
What's wrong? What happened?

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:54.890
My mom...

00:05:55.960 --> 00:06:00.030
has been in bed for days.
She can't even keep a sip of water down.

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.200
She's completely bedridden.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.570
Gosh, so that's it.

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:09.940
I imagine she's very disappointed
she couldn't be with me.

00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:15.650
I'm afraid so.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:20.380
Ever since she had dinner with you,
she took to her bed that very day.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:23.420
She hasn't been able to get up since.

00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:30.190
Chairman.

00:06:31.460 --> 00:06:33.300
I have a favor to ask.

00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:36.570
Could you please come to our house...

00:06:37.340 --> 00:06:40.510
and check in on my mother?

00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.810
If she sees you,

00:06:46.410 --> 00:06:47.980
I think she'll get her strength back...

00:06:48.580 --> 00:06:50.820
to at least drink some water.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.120
I know I'm overstepping,

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:55.720
but I must beg you.

00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.690
All right, I understand.
Put your mother on the phone.

00:07:01.060 --> 00:07:02.130
Sorry?

00:07:02.730 --> 00:07:05.730
Just a moment, please.

00:07:07.470 --> 00:07:09.600
She's so weak,

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:12.870
so I don't know if she can even talk
on the phone.

00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:14.340
Just a second.

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:16.710
What do we do?

00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:18.740
Mom.

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:23.110
Mom, pull yourself together.
It's the Chairman.

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:26.650
Can you talk to him?

00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.220
- Come on, try, Mom.
- Gosh.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:32.990
Hello?

00:07:33.490 --> 00:07:36.360
Mrs. Yeom. Are you really that sick?

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:38.600
Wait... Chairman.

00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:44.670
Listen, I'm sending Dr. Kim over.
He can give you an IV drip for now.

00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:45.900
I'll be there shortly.

00:07:48.570 --> 00:07:51.510
Hello? Chairman? Gosh, he just hung up.

00:07:51.540 --> 00:07:52.740
- Darn.
- Gosh.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:55.480
Seriously! What are we going to do?

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.920
- When Dr. Kim gets here, the jig is up.
- What are we going to do?

00:07:58.450 --> 00:08:01.290
Gosh, he's so shrewd.
Just like a chairman should be.

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:03.220
Quick, lie down! Come on, lie down!

00:08:03.220 --> 00:08:05.360
- Here? Like this? How?
- Goodness.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.120
Darn it.
You're supposed to be on your deathbed!

00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:09.230
You look way too healthy!

00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:12.130
My goodness,
the things you say to your own mother!

00:08:12.600 --> 00:08:14.930
Go get my makeup.

00:08:15.930 --> 00:08:17.900
Time to work some makeup magic.
What other choice do we have?

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.910
All that time I spent as an assistant
to the star Chae Hwa Young...

00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.210
is finally about to pay off.

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:28.250
That's where I learned to do stage makeup,
you know.

00:08:28.350 --> 00:08:31.480
Gosh, but Chairman Ma is a sly old fox.

00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.480
I don't know if he'll fall for it.

00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:36.890
We have to do whatever it takes
to get what we want.

00:08:37.020 --> 00:08:38.060
What other choice do we have?

00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.330
Three or four should be enough, right?

00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.070
Yes, that's plenty
to share with the staff.

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:50.400
You'll be okay going by yourself?

00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:53.870
Dad, what do you take me for,
a little kid?

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.370
Okay. Make sure to thank her.

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:58.810
She's really saved Tae Pyung, hasn't she?

00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:03.180
I know. After he got scammed
and lost money so many times,

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:06.150
he's finally getting to sing
on a real stage.

00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.920
I'll go and thank her profusely.

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:11.220
- Okay.
- I'll be back.

00:09:11.290 --> 00:09:12.290
Be safe.

00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.090
(Dream Hotel)

00:09:21.370 --> 00:09:23.830
(Dream Hotel, Grand Reopening)

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:32.810
My hand is all better now,

00:09:33.740 --> 00:09:35.410
but since I started
my lunch box delivery business,

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:37.620
I can't just get a job at a restaurant.

00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:42.050
Since I'm here, I might as well try to see
Chef Kang Jun Ho before I leave.

00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:02.810
Director Ma Seo Rin.

00:10:04.210 --> 00:10:06.610
- Yes?
- Do you know what my staff is saying?

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:11.420
Rumors say I'm about to get fired
from this restaurant, all because of you.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:16.620
- Because of me?
- Why should I suffer because of you?

00:10:16.890 --> 00:10:19.060
Don't pay any attention to the rumors.

00:10:19.590 --> 00:10:22.360
Chef Kang Jun Ho,
you're more thin-skinned than you look.

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.600
As long as I'm fine with it,
what's there to worry about?

00:10:25.700 --> 00:10:28.830
I want to be judged fairly on my skills,

00:10:29.530 --> 00:10:31.670
but you're making that impossible.

00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:34.440
The results aren't even out yet.

00:10:34.470 --> 00:10:36.910
And if you do get fired,

00:10:37.510 --> 00:10:39.210
you can just marry me.

00:10:40.680 --> 00:10:42.150
I told you, I'll take care of you.

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.400
I don't see Chef Kang Jun Ho anywhere.

00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:06.270
Welcome. Do you have a reservation?

00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:09.270
Sorry? No.

00:11:10.310 --> 00:11:11.380
Well, then...

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:18.880
Goodbye.

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:30.800
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:11:31.030 --> 00:11:32.030
By the way,

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.070
are you going somewhere today?

You're dressed differently than usual.

00:11:38.570 --> 00:11:39.570
Do I look nice?

00:11:40.440 --> 00:11:41.440
Yes.

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.970
I'm going to a concert,
so you can head home for the day.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:45.480
CEO Chae.

00:11:46.940 --> 00:11:48.350
I was just wondering
who you're going with.

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:52.820
And why would you need to know that?
How presumptuous.

00:11:53.080 --> 00:11:55.790
Lee Kang Hyuk,
don't cross the line. Got it?

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:04.900
I'm here to deliver this
to CEO Chae Hwa Young.

00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.660
I'm sorry, but this is a restricted area.

00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:08.830
I'll make sure she gets it,
so you can just give it to me.

00:12:08.870 --> 00:12:09.900
Well...

00:12:09.930 --> 00:12:14.640
Please tell her it's a thank-you gift
from the singer, Tae Pyung.

00:12:14.710 --> 00:12:16.310
Please tell her that.

00:12:16.310 --> 00:12:18.440
Wait. Here, take this.

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:22.210
Please give this
to CEO Chae Hwa Young too.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:24.680
- I will.
- Okay, thank you.

00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:33.560
Gosh, she looks exactly like Director Ma.

00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:39.000
CEO Chae. Someone just dropped this off
for you.

00:12:41.330 --> 00:12:43.500
- A lunch box?
- Yes, she just left.

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.210
You can have it. I have an appointment,
so I have to go.

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:59.550
My dear, just because you can't marry me,

00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.090
you can't be this heartbroken, can you?

00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:05.220
How could a lowly person like me...

00:13:07.190 --> 00:13:10.360
hope to be with you, Chairman?

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:14.600
For Director Ma and CEO Chae
to be against it...

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:16.600
is only natural.

00:13:17.100 --> 00:13:18.740
Come on, cheer up. Okay?

00:13:19.100 --> 00:13:21.470
- I'll reconsider.
- What?

00:13:22.510 --> 00:13:24.010
Do you really mean it?

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:26.140
Goodness.

00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:29.050
I'm so drained,
I don't have the energy to be happy.

00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.550
Just focus on getting back on your feet.

00:13:32.050 --> 00:13:33.980
Besides, who else do I have now?

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.950
The only one who knows
exactly what I need...

00:13:36.190 --> 00:13:37.760
is you, Mrs. Yeom.

00:13:40.590 --> 00:13:41.790

- Right.

I hear it's pretty well known.

00:13:52.570 --> 00:13:54.910

- Thank you.

Gosh, what's the point of being a lawyer
if you can't make it to a meal on time?

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:32.140
I'm a bit late
because I was coming from court.

Where's Jang Mi?

00:14:36.410 --> 00:14:39.080
So dinner was just an excuse.
He came to see my Jang Mi.

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.720
She's out on a delivery.
She'll be back soon.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:48.030
- I'm back!
- You're back? Talk about timing.

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:51.460
Why? Were you talking trash about me?

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:53.900
Trash talk? Of course not. Suk Hee,

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:58.440
- let's go out and get some ice cream.
- Okay, Suk Hee's getting ice cream!

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:03.240
Hey, Lawyer Kang.
Tell Jang Mi what you told me earlier.

00:15:03.310 --> 00:15:06.010
About that Dangjang Market thing,
all right?

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:08.080
- What?
- Let's go.

00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:10.110
Suk Hee, let's get going.

00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:12.450

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:14.320
I was talking about the banners.

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.690
Who says you can only hang them outdoors?

00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:21.690
You're right.
We could advertise at Dangjang Market.

00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.500
Thanks to you, Professor,
I feel completely refreshed today.

00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:30.500
How long will you call me "Professor?"
I do have a name, you know.

00:15:30.930 --> 00:15:34.370
Oh, my.
Should I call you by your name then?

00:15:34.970 --> 00:15:37.640
Please. I call you Hwa Young, don't I?

- Here, have some more.
- Okay.

Here.

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:01.600
That's okay.

00:16:02.570 --> 00:16:04.340
You're making me embarrassed.

00:16:05.600 --> 00:16:06.600
Come on.

00:16:12.310 --> 00:16:14.580
It tastes even better
coming from you, Nam Bong.

00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:17.850
I could do this for you every day.

00:16:19.180 --> 00:16:20.320
Actually,

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.150
I have insomnia,
so I have trouble sleeping,

00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:26.290
but I'd love to stay up all night
talking on the phone with you.

00:16:29.160 --> 00:16:30.860
Yes, let's do that.

00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.200
But that wouldn't be okay, would it?

What's your wife like?

00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:42.570
Why? Are you curious?

00:16:43.210 --> 00:16:44.580
Of course I'm curious.

00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:47.310
I guess I'm a little jealous.

Are you a rainbow drifting away?

Chae Hwa Young has gotten too powerful.

00:17:26.150 --> 00:17:30.320
I tried to bring in Yeom San Wol
to keep her in check, and she objects?

00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:33.490

What do you think, Team Leader Jin?
Are you pleased?

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:53.780
Gosh.

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.050
Where did you get the money
to buy me clothes?

00:17:56.410 --> 00:17:58.520
It's not like you have any money.

00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:01.080
A black card.

00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:04.320
Don't tell me...
The Chairman gave it to you?

00:18:05.590 --> 00:18:09.730
I guess he felt bad our move-in plans
were ruined by that brat Ma Seo Rin.

00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:12.200
He told us to go treat ourselves.

- No, we can't.

spending the Chairman's money carelessly.

00:23:05.990 --> 00:23:08.230
I might even get to see Chef Kang Jun Ho
when I go!

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:10.490
Goodness,
you're really that happy about it?

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:13.530
Of course I am! He's my idol.

00:23:15.230 --> 00:23:19.700
If only I hadn't hurt my hand,
I could have been working for Chef Kang.

00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:23.210
Right. Have you found the jerk
who did that to your hand yet?

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:27.140
If I ever get my hands on that punk,
I'll wring his neck.

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:29.150
Dad, calm down. Your blood pressure.

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:32.550
I shouldn't have brought it up.
Anyway, I'll be right back.

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:34.550
Yes, okay. Go on.

00:24:08.920 --> 00:24:11.860
I've scheduled your physical therapy
session for 4 p.m.

00:24:12.590 --> 00:24:14.930
When you get stressed,
your whole body tenses up.

00:24:15.190 --> 00:24:16.390
You know how your muscles get all knotted.

00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:18.360
That's how you've gotten hurt
so many times.

00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.200
Do I look like I have time
for a physical therapy session right now?

00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:25.200
Not when he promoted Jin Hong Ju
just to shove her in my face.

00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:28.340
Chairman Ma is just sending a message...

00:24:28.910 --> 00:24:32.680
that he's still in control.
You shouldn't let it get to you.

00:24:34.040 --> 00:24:37.780
Right.
I've waited and held on for 30 years.

00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:39.980
What's a few more years to me?

00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:43.950
Let that old fool, Chairman Ma,
pull whatever stunts he wants.

00:24:49.190 --> 00:24:52.860
A shopping basket? Seriously?
As a singer, I have an image to uphold.

00:24:52.930 --> 00:24:57.030
Hey, Singer Oh.
Give it a rest, will you? Seriously.

00:24:57.870 --> 00:25:00.570
Oh, right. Baek Ho posted
on Dangjang Market...

00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:02.670
a "Help us find the banner vandal" post.

00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:04.770
I think he got a few useful leads, Dad.

00:25:05.210 --> 00:25:06.210
Oh, did he?

00:25:29.870 --> 00:25:32.100
Aren't you Tae Sook?

00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.100
Oh, it's Tae Sook!

00:25:34.170 --> 00:25:35.410
Tae Sook's here.

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:36.870
Dad!

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:40.340
Hey! What are you doing here?

00:25:40.740 --> 00:25:41.980
Tae Sook!

00:25:42.350 --> 00:25:46.780
Hi. Hey, Bo Ra.
Say hi to Grandpa and your uncle.

00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:49.590
Okay. Hello.

00:25:49.590 --> 00:25:51.760
Hello to you too.

00:25:54.120 --> 00:25:56.330
Mom, you haven't changed a bit.

00:26:10.110 --> 00:26:12.680
- Lunch box delivery? Let me take that.
- Oh, yes.

00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:18.520
Does Chef Kang Jun Ho eat these too,
by any chance?

00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:22.150
It's just that I admire him so much.

00:26:24.890 --> 00:26:28.090
I'm sorry. You should go eat
before your break is over.

00:26:28.220 --> 00:26:29.660
- Enjoy your meal.
- Thanks.

00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.430
Oh, my gosh. She's the spitting image
of Director Ma.

00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:03.860
What is it?

00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:05.130
Oh, the lunch boxes.

00:27:05.130 --> 00:27:07.130
We ordered from here because it's amazing.

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:13.100
Goodness.

00:27:15.570 --> 00:27:19.080
I can't believe I almost ran into
Chef Kang Jun Ho looking like this.

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:26.550
Oh, well. I'm just happy I got to see him
after all this time.

00:27:32.590 --> 00:27:33.690
I'll bring the car around.

00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:53.140
Seo Rin.

00:28:18.070 --> 00:28:19.700
(The First Man)

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:23.610
She must be a look-alike.
So many people look alike.

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:26.410
Please don't let her be
Jung Suk Hee's daughter.

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:29.250
What's got you in such a good mood?

00:28:29.610 --> 00:28:32.450
I got to see Chef Kang Jun Ho today,
whom I'm a huge fan of.

00:28:32.650 --> 00:28:35.450
Wait, Chef Kang Jun Ho is the one
you have a crush on?

00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:37.020
Welcome.

00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:38.490
Time to find out for sure.

00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:39.960
We're in big trouble.

00:28:40.220 --> 00:28:42.160
Oh Tae Pyung is on his way there!
Get out of there now.

00:28:42.730 --> 00:28:43.730
CEO Chae?

00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:46.460
