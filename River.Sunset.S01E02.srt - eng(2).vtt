00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:40.120
Sir, wait.

00:01:57.079 --> 00:01:58.599
Please show me your identification.

00:01:59.079 --> 00:02:00.159
This is my identification.

00:02:02.879 --> 00:02:04.799
This is what Engineer Kaisawa and I are discussing.

00:02:04.799 --> 00:02:06.519
The revised tank design blueprints.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:11.000
These are the design blueprints

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000
for the tanks we use on the Southeast Asian front.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.919
This is the fountain pen I just used

00:02:15.919 --> 00:02:17.439
to approve the revisions.

00:02:18.599 --> 00:02:19.719
Colonel, please forgive me.

00:02:19.719 --> 00:02:21.159
I couldn't stop them.

00:02:21.879 --> 00:02:22.879
I hope you

00:02:22.879 --> 00:02:24.439
can finish looking and return it to me quickly.

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:25.240
But first,

00:02:25.879 --> 00:02:27.879
you need the authority to view it.

00:02:28.879 --> 00:02:29.759
Colonel, sir.

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:32.800
Sir, I am truly sorry.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:35.759
I am Ida Ueji from the Tokyo Metropolitan Police.

00:02:35.759 --> 00:02:36.840
My primary duty is overseeing this

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.280
101st Division recruitment effort.

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:40.039
I don't know who gave you the nerve

00:02:40.039 --> 00:02:41.520
to barge into this room.

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:43.280
Do you suspect Engineer Kaisawa,

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:45.479
or do you doubt my identity?

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.759
Should I go to the police headquarters tomorrow

00:02:47.759 --> 00:02:49.159
and report my work in detail

00:02:49.159 --> 00:02:50.360
to your superior?

00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.039
Or should I have him

00:02:51.039 --> 00:02:52.479
give me a reasonable explanation

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.719
for why his subordinates

00:02:53.719 --> 00:02:54.919
are disturbing my work?

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.840
Colonel, sir.

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:57.719
We are deeply sorry.

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:00.080
We truly didn't know you were here.

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:01.759
It was absolutely unintentional.

00:03:01.759 --> 00:03:02.800
Unintentional?

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.400
When faced with these blueprints,

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:07.080
should you examine them carefully,

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:09.000
or should you shut your damn eyes?

00:03:09.120 --> 00:03:11.000
Sh-shut them.

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:17.560
Look!

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:19.680
Open your eyes and look!

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.680
Didn't you want to see?

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:22.840
Look!

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:24.520
Look!

00:03:25.919 --> 00:03:27.639
Colonel, please calm down.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.520
They were just doing their duty.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:31.919
I beg you, Colonel,

00:03:31.919 --> 00:03:32.599
if possible,

00:03:32.919 --> 00:03:34.039
do not reprimand them.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.199
Yes, yes, yes.

00:03:46.199 --> 00:03:48.360
Out of respect for Engineer Kaisawa,

00:03:48.599 --> 00:03:50.120
were you here today?

00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:51.560
No.

00:03:54.319 --> 00:03:55.719
Is Engineer Kaisawa a problem?

00:03:55.719 --> 00:03:56.400
No.

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.039
I still need to discuss the blueprints

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:00.319
with Engineer Kaisawa,

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:01.919
and I do not wish to be disturbed.

00:04:01.919 --> 00:04:02.800
Can you manage that?

00:04:03.439 --> 00:04:04.680
Yes, yes.

00:04:08.199 --> 00:04:09.319
Then get the hell out!

00:04:10.199 --> 00:04:12.400
Yes, we'll take our leave.

00:04:36.279 --> 00:04:38.040
That colonel is too fierce.

00:04:38.839 --> 00:04:40.160
Did you see his face?

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.839
I didn't dare look.

00:04:42.439 --> 00:04:43.639
Let's hurry up and go.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.360
Go, go, go.

00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:46.879
Close the door.

00:05:05.560 --> 00:05:06.000
Alright.

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.000
Woodcutter calling.

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:25.920
Authentication.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:28.360
Nine nine five three four two one.

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:33.000
Repeat.

00:05:34.279 --> 00:05:35.519
Woodcutter calling.

00:05:36.279 --> 00:05:38.199
Authentication nine nine five three four two one.

00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.680
Report.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.920
Chief.

00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.360
Woodcutter is calling.

00:05:50.439 --> 00:05:51.319
At this moment,

00:05:51.319 --> 00:05:53.279
the Shanghai underground organization of the Chinese Communist Party

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:57.439
also received the signal that Wumu was activated.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.959
He is a member of the Japanese Emperor's cabinet.

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:14.959
His position is Military Councilor,

00:06:15.079 --> 00:06:16.639
that is, a Japanese baron,

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:17.839
Admiral of the Navy,

00:06:17.879 --> 00:06:19.120
Osumi Mineo.

00:06:21.079 --> 00:06:23.160
On the morning of February fifth, one year ago,

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:24.920
an aircraft

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.439
crashed into Huangyang Mountain

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:30.040
in Doumen District, north of Sanzao Island.

00:06:30.279 --> 00:06:32.879
Last July, our sleeper agent

00:06:32.959 --> 00:06:35.759
received orders to investigate the crash.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:37.600
But soon after,

00:06:37.639 --> 00:06:39.600
Prime Minister Konoe Fumimaro stepped down,

00:06:39.759 --> 00:06:41.319
and Tojo Hideki became Prime Minister.

00:06:41.519 --> 00:06:43.120
The investigation was shelved.

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:44.279
Now we plan

00:06:44.279 --> 00:06:45.920
to restart this mission.

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.040
The sleeper agent

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:48.959
will go to Sanzao Island

00:06:48.959 --> 00:06:50.920
as a Japanese Imperial envoy,

00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:52.040
under the pretext of investigating

00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.120
Admiral Osumi Mineo's crash,

00:06:53.439 --> 00:06:54.519
to rescue the person.

00:06:57.519 --> 00:06:58.680
I'm considering

00:06:58.680 --> 00:07:00.160
whether we can assign our man

00:07:00.439 --> 00:07:02.439
a local guide as an assistant

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:03.519
to accompany him to the island.

00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.040
You mean

00:07:06.439 --> 00:07:08.360
a senior Japanese officer

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:10.600
with a Chinese assistant?

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:11.360
Yes.

00:07:12.199 --> 00:07:15.439
The Japanese carried out a massacre on the island.

00:07:15.439 --> 00:07:16.800
So sending someone

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.680
in a Japanese military uniform

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:19.879
will find it hard to gain the locals' trust.

00:07:21.319 --> 00:07:22.800
We can arrange it.

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.319
We can simply say it's

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:26.360
at the Tokyo envoy's request,

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:29.040
entrusting Shanghai's No. 76

00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:31.639
to find him a Sanzao Island native

00:07:31.639 --> 00:07:34.160
as his assistant for the island trip.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:35.800
This way, I think

00:07:36.199 --> 00:07:38.160
it should be explainable.

00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.879
If the person we find

00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:43.439
is not a professional agent,

00:07:43.439 --> 00:07:44.680
do you think it will work?

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:45.839
No problem.

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.480
The assistant is just visiting family on the island.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.680
Visiting around every day.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:50.959
But his real purpose

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:51.879
is to locate our

00:07:51.879 --> 00:07:53.759
Allied Major who landed there,

00:07:53.759 --> 00:07:55.600
and mobilize the locals to hand him over,

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.600
supporting us.

00:07:57.199 --> 00:07:57.879
Good.

00:07:58.879 --> 00:07:59.720
Director Li.

00:07:59.959 --> 00:08:01.519
Please pass down the order

00:08:01.519 --> 00:08:03.839
to proceed according to Director Shen's suggestion.

00:08:04.439 --> 00:08:06.360
Time may be running short.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.439
Notify our internal system directly

00:08:08.439 --> 00:08:09.319
and all war zones

00:08:09.319 --> 00:08:10.879
to search the rosters overnight

00:08:10.879 --> 00:08:12.120
to find such a

00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.439
qualified Sanzao Island native.

00:08:14.439 --> 00:08:14.920
Yes.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.720
Wait.

00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:37.960
Someone's there.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:39.840
Hide first.

00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:40.720
Go.

00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:10.200
What are they doing out so late?

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:11.639
Xia'er.

00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.840
Go and see.

00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:13.720
Okay.

00:09:13.879 --> 00:09:14.799
What about the Major?

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:16.639
It's not far from home.

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.799
It's fine, I'll handle it.

00:09:18.279 --> 00:09:19.399
You go and check.

00:09:19.399 --> 00:09:19.960
Alright.

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:22.039
Fourth Aunt, give me a hand.

00:09:22.039 --> 00:09:22.720
That's good.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:23.480
Come on.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:26.679
Dad, take it slow.

00:09:26.679 --> 00:09:27.039
Okay.

00:09:33.159 --> 00:09:34.120
Take the back path.

00:09:48.639 --> 00:09:49.399
Search carefully.

00:09:55.399 --> 00:09:56.360
Master.

00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.279
He's burning up.

00:09:58.639 --> 00:10:00.279
He seems to have a fever.

00:10:00.559 --> 00:10:01.320
Go to Longxia's room.

00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.000
Get some clothes and his quilt.

00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.039
And prepare some liquor too.

00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:05.960
To bring his fever down.

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:06.879
Okay.

00:10:07.639 --> 00:10:08.759
I'll help him inside.

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:09.720
Easy now.

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:11.799
You go, you go.

00:10:11.919 --> 00:10:12.639
Alright.

00:10:15.039 --> 00:10:15.559
Come on.

00:10:16.639 --> 00:10:17.639
The secret room is here.

00:10:23.759 --> 00:10:24.519
Steady, steady.

00:10:35.960 --> 00:10:36.279
Here.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.639
This secret room...

00:10:55.639 --> 00:10:58.360
...was built by my grandfather.

00:10:59.399 --> 00:11:01.919
That was many years ago.

00:11:03.159 --> 00:11:05.799
It was built specifically to guard against pirates.

00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:13.200
Hurry over.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:13.840
Come here.

00:11:14.519 --> 00:11:16.039
Found an American soldier's cap.

00:11:16.039 --> 00:11:17.360
Look, everyone.

00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:25.759
Now you can tell me...

00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.440
...why you came to China.

00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:30.480
This matter is too big.

00:11:30.639 --> 00:11:32.960
Sorry, I can't tell you.

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:38.279
Fine, I won't ask then.

00:11:52.559 --> 00:11:53.720
What is it?

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.399
The Japanese may already know...

00:11:55.399 --> 00:11:56.559
...about the Major's existence.

00:11:56.559 --> 00:11:57.720
They found...

00:11:57.720 --> 00:11:58.879
...his lost cap by the sea.

00:11:59.399 --> 00:12:00.360
I expect soon...

00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:02.039
...the Japanese soldiers will conduct a major search.

00:12:02.279 --> 00:12:03.279
Should we move him...

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:23.879
I'm back.

00:12:55.720 --> 00:12:57.360
I might have to go on a long trip in a couple of days.

00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.120
When are you leaving?

00:13:05.039 --> 00:13:05.960
Soon, I guess.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:11.120
Another conscription order came down today.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:14.559
All men under fifty-five have to join the army.

00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:16.960
Whose child is it?

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.399
They're all flesh from their mother's body.

00:13:20.399 --> 00:13:21.399
What mother...

00:13:21.399 --> 00:13:23.320
...would want to see her child...

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.320
...hit by a bullet?

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:27.919
How heartbreaking that would be.

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:32.559
I can take care of myself.

00:13:33.679 --> 00:13:34.600
Earlier...

00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:36.879
...Mayama Toshiki's mother...

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.679
...brought many Senninbari.

00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:40.519
Wanted them finished quickly.

00:13:41.679 --> 00:13:43.759
Said they were for soldiers going to the front...

00:13:43.759 --> 00:13:44.759
...to ward off bullets.

00:13:45.159 --> 00:13:45.960
But...

00:13:46.879 --> 00:13:49.000
...right after you left...

00:13:49.639 --> 00:13:51.799
...she received her youngest son's...

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.440
...death notice.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.240
You really shouldn't be doing this sewing.

00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.799
Who knows, these Senninbari...

00:14:04.240 --> 00:14:06.559
...might be sent to the battlefields in China.

00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.440
Where are you going?

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:12.440
China.

00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:26.879
Seven Seven Zero Two, prepare for test flight.

00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:29.559
Seven Seven Zero Two, roger.

00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:33.120
Seven Seven Zero Two, ready.

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.399
Seven Seven Zero Two, ignition.

00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:37.960
Roger.

00:14:39.399 --> 00:14:41.960
Seven Seven Zero Two, taxiing onto the runway.

00:14:43.039 --> 00:14:45.840
Seven Seven Zero Two, cleared for takeoff.

00:14:48.080 --> 00:14:52.519
Seven Seven Zero Two, wishing for a successful 250-meter takeoff.

00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:24.320
Why are we practicing...

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:26.440
...a 250-meter takeoff distance?

00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:27.679
Our...

00:15:27.679 --> 00:15:28.840
...can't possibly meet such a requirement.

00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:31.320
This thing is too heavy.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:33.799
Even the best pilot couldn't...

00:15:33.799 --> 00:15:35.840
...take off on such a short runway.

00:15:36.759 --> 00:15:37.559
Colonel.

00:15:37.559 --> 00:15:39.120
A behemoth weighing thirteen tons...

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.320
...on such a short runway...

00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.559
...will definitely not get airborne.

00:15:42.039 --> 00:15:43.320
Go get the chief engineer.

00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:45.840
Tell the plane to return.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:47.559
We must remove all the big stuff.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:50.519
Sir, remove all the guns?

00:15:50.519 --> 00:15:53.080
What on earth is this guy trying to do?

00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:53.960
I don't understand either.

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.240
Seven Seven Zero Two, return to base.

00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:03.519
Seven Seven Zero Two, roger.

00:16:21.519 --> 00:16:23.600
The world's worst shooting weapon...

00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.200
...is the ventral turret.

00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:25.720
Sir.

00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.480
The gunner has to control it remotely...

00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:28.279
...through a periscope?

00:16:28.919 --> 00:16:30.399
Before learning how to aim...

00:16:30.399 --> 00:16:32.240
...you could learn to play the violin.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:33.399
Take it off.

00:16:34.039 --> 00:16:34.840
Yes, sir.

00:16:35.399 --> 00:16:36.279
That saves us...

00:16:36.279 --> 00:16:37.799
...a lot of weight and an extra gunner.

00:16:37.879 --> 00:16:40.840
All we really need is the tail gun.

00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:44.960
I think the tail gun is useless too.

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.200
We can remove that as well.

00:16:46.440 --> 00:16:47.440
Colonel.

00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.720
If we remove the ventral gun and tail gun...

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:51.919
...what do we do if we encounter enemy planes?

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.559
Use this.

00:16:58.840 --> 00:16:59.919
Paint it black.

00:16:59.919 --> 00:17:01.919
From a distance, no one can tell the difference.

00:17:02.919 --> 00:17:04.960
Use a broom.

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:23.920
What we found

00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:27.200
were the bodies of the pilot and navigator.

00:17:27.559 --> 00:17:29.319
Both were wearing flight helmets.

00:17:29.480 --> 00:17:32.680
So this military cap

00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:36.519
belongs to a fourth person.

00:17:37.799 --> 00:17:40.359
There were four people on that plane.

00:17:41.799 --> 00:17:45.319
At least four people.

00:17:46.039 --> 00:17:47.960
A transport plane

00:17:48.480 --> 00:17:51.200
carrying American soldiers passed Sanzao Island.

00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.440
What was it doing?

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:56.200
That's what I can't figure out.

00:17:58.279 --> 00:17:59.720
Sasaki.

00:18:00.480 --> 00:18:03.400
Do you think this man is dead or alive?

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:05.640
How did this cap end up

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:07.920
on the shore east of Tanjia Bay?

00:18:09.799 --> 00:18:11.839
He could have been killed

00:18:11.839 --> 00:18:12.880
when the plane was shot down.

00:18:13.559 --> 00:18:14.759
The body fell into the sea,

00:18:15.599 --> 00:18:19.519
and the cap washed ashore.

00:18:20.279 --> 00:18:22.079
That is a possibility.

00:18:22.079 --> 00:18:25.359
But there's another possibility.

00:18:25.359 --> 00:18:26.359
What is it?

00:18:26.799 --> 00:18:28.960
This man is not dead.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.920
And he came ashore on the island.

00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:34.839
Really?

00:18:55.319 --> 00:18:55.880
Doi.

00:18:55.880 --> 00:18:56.279
Sir.

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:57.400
Post sentries around the village.

00:18:57.400 --> 00:18:58.079
All around it.

00:18:58.079 --> 00:18:59.440
Prevent anyone from slipping out.

00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.920
Yes, sir.

00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:02.599
About face!

00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:05.759
Everyone else, search the village.

00:19:05.759 --> 00:19:07.960
Not a single house is to be missed.

00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:08.720
Go, quickly!

00:19:08.720 --> 00:19:09.279
Yes, sir!

00:19:10.160 --> 00:19:11.039
About face!

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.440
Double time, march!

00:19:13.519 --> 00:19:14.559
Let's go too.

00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:39.640
German Shepherd, sniff.

00:19:39.759 --> 00:19:42.200
Sniff it good.

00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.240
Whose house is this?

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:12.920
It seems to be the wealthy Ye Degong's.

00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:13.759
That servant's house.

00:20:14.680 --> 00:20:15.599
It's an old woman.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:17.279
She usually lives at the Ye house,

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:18.559
but sometimes comes back here.

00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:20.240
Sasaki.

00:20:21.079 --> 00:20:22.559
To Ye Degong's house.

00:20:23.079 --> 00:20:24.079
Well done.

00:20:36.839 --> 00:20:37.480
They're here! They're here!

00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:38.079
Master!

00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.240
They're here!

00:20:39.240 --> 00:20:40.400
Right at our gate!

00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:41.799
And they have a dog with them!

00:20:41.799 --> 00:20:43.039
Don't panic. Don't panic.

00:20:44.119 --> 00:20:45.200
Go inside and perform the rites.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.279
Light the incense first.

00:20:57.079 --> 00:20:57.759
Old Master Ye.

00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.200
Hello.

00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.480
Why have you brought so many soldiers?

00:21:03.319 --> 00:21:04.039
It's like this.

00:21:04.640 --> 00:21:06.599
We received a report from a villager

00:21:07.039 --> 00:21:08.039
that your household

00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.920
is hiding a big-nosed American.

00:21:10.480 --> 00:21:11.799
You're joking.

00:21:13.039 --> 00:21:14.319
For years, this island

00:21:14.319 --> 00:21:16.279
has been sealed tight by you.

00:21:16.759 --> 00:21:19.039
Where would a big-nosed American come from?

00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:21.920
Well then,

00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:23.160
may we search?

00:21:23.599 --> 00:21:24.119
You may.

00:21:24.200 --> 00:21:25.079
Of course you may.

00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:25.559
Please.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.680
German Shepherd, sniff.

00:21:35.519 --> 00:21:37.039
Good boy.

00:21:37.279 --> 00:21:38.960
Go on, look around.

00:21:39.079 --> 00:21:40.559
Where is it?

00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:43.519
Where is it? Where?

00:21:53.039 --> 00:21:54.039
Over there?

00:21:58.039 --> 00:21:59.160
Or over here?

00:21:59.559 --> 00:22:00.559
Here?

00:22:06.039 --> 00:22:07.039
Here.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:16.319
Old Master Ye.

00:22:16.920 --> 00:22:17.880
What are you doing?

00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:21.920
Today is our ancestor's birthday.

00:22:22.240 --> 00:22:23.839
There is a wine offering ceremony.

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:49.640
What's the matter?

00:22:49.640 --> 00:22:52.480
Wait.

00:22:59.079 --> 00:23:00.160
Come here. Come here.

00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:01.119
What's wrong with you?

00:23:02.160 --> 00:23:04.599
Why do you fail at the crucial moment?

00:23:07.839 --> 00:23:08.240
Report!

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:09.400
We've searched everywhere.

00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:10.319
Nothing found.

00:23:17.759 --> 00:23:18.839
Old Master Ye.

00:23:20.839 --> 00:23:22.480
I hear you once served as

00:23:22.480 --> 00:23:24.039
a consul to America.

00:23:24.039 --> 00:23:24.759
Is that correct?

00:23:26.559 --> 00:23:28.039
That was in the previous dynasty.

00:23:28.039 --> 00:23:29.359
Now it's the Republic.

00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:30.400
Yes.

00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:31.920
But...

00:23:32.440 --> 00:23:34.240
You must be very familiar

00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:36.440
with those big-nosed Americans.

00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:37.759
Communicating with them

00:23:37.759 --> 00:23:38.799
should pose no difficulty for you.

00:23:38.799 --> 00:23:39.359
Right?

00:23:39.759 --> 00:23:40.759
This old man never leaves his home.

00:23:40.759 --> 00:23:41.599
I don't step beyond my inner gate.

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.599
Where would I go to find a big-nosed American?

00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:53.119
Don't forget what I told you at the ancestral hall.

00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.680
You must never touch

00:23:56.119 --> 00:23:57.799
things you should not touch.

00:23:58.079 --> 00:23:58.759
Do you understand?

00:24:03.759 --> 00:24:05.119
The nation has its laws,

00:24:05.119 --> 00:24:06.319
the family has its rules.

00:24:07.759 --> 00:24:09.240
Next time you enter,

00:24:09.559 --> 00:24:10.559
please knock.

00:24:20.119 --> 00:24:20.799
That's enough.

00:24:21.720 --> 00:24:22.480
Fall in!

00:24:41.240 --> 00:24:42.160
Luckily, they think

00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:43.720
that American has a big nose.

00:24:46.039 --> 00:24:47.160
We avoided them today,

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:49.759
but tomorrow, the day after,

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.359
and the day after that?

00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:55.319
If the Major's illness isn't cured,

00:24:55.759 --> 00:24:56.799
how can we get him off the island?

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:46.960
Help!

00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:51.880
Help me!

00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:56.119
Let go of me!

00:25:56.799 --> 00:25:58.319
Let me go!

00:26:03.359 --> 00:26:05.160
Help!

00:26:08.599 --> 00:26:09.640
Huihui!

00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:11.559
Let me go!

00:26:11.799 --> 00:26:13.160
Help me!

00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:14.640
Let go!

00:26:40.480 --> 00:26:41.720
Father!

00:26:44.039 --> 00:26:45.920
Dad!

00:26:46.359 --> 00:26:51.240
Dad!

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.079
Dad

00:27:00.519 --> 00:27:00.960
The garrison troops

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:01.920
Why did they come here?

00:27:03.640 --> 00:27:05.880
Darn it, how am I supposed to write my report?

00:27:07.319 --> 00:27:09.119
For trying to rape a woman

00:27:10.359 --> 00:27:11.039
A full-fledged Private Second Class

00:27:11.039 --> 00:27:11.960
Got beaten up by an old man.

00:27:12.119 --> 00:27:13.119
It's utterly humiliating.

00:27:13.200 --> 00:27:14.559
There are plenty of women in the village.

00:27:14.799 --> 00:27:16.559
Was it worth being in such a hurry?

00:27:16.960 --> 00:27:18.400
I'm really furious.

00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:21.119
Enough.

00:27:22.400 --> 00:27:24.480
Carry him back.

00:27:37.079 --> 00:27:37.759
Sasaki

00:27:39.319 --> 00:27:42.319
Take her to the comfort station.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:45.160
Why are you like this again?

00:27:45.160 --> 00:27:46.839
I told Fukuda

00:27:46.839 --> 00:27:48.160
to save this one for me.

00:27:49.599 --> 00:27:50.599
Stand up.

00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:52.079
Come here.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.920
Dad!

00:27:54.559 --> 00:27:55.680
Dad!

00:27:57.559 --> 00:27:58.480
Dad!

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.359
Sorry.

00:28:10.559 --> 00:28:12.279
I forgot about you.

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.240
Fall in.

00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:41.640
Hello? Anyone there? Fukuda?

00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:43.200
Captain Inoue.

00:28:44.039 --> 00:28:45.039
Where's Fukuda?

00:28:45.119 --> 00:28:47.519
Fukuda went to Shanghai to procure supplies.

00:28:47.759 --> 00:28:49.279
He should be back in a day or two.

00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:50.559
I see.

00:28:51.039 --> 00:28:51.880
Alright then.

00:28:52.279 --> 00:28:54.279
I'm leaving this woman with you.

00:29:01.039 --> 00:29:03.720
From today, she will serve the Imperial Army.

00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.160
I'll save her especially for you.

00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:17.839
Don't get up.

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:22.359
Mr. Ye.

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.839
Thank you very much for saving me.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:28.920
I'll leave here right now.

00:29:30.119 --> 00:29:30.799
You leave here?

00:29:30.799 --> 00:29:31.680
Where will you go?

00:29:31.920 --> 00:29:33.200
I won't implicate you.

00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:35.400
Where do you think you can go?

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:36.119
On this island,

00:29:36.519 --> 00:29:37.559
there are no unfamiliar faces.

00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:39.079
You won't last a few hours out there

00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:40.440
before you're captured.

00:29:40.839 --> 00:29:42.319
I'll figure something out myself.

00:29:43.880 --> 00:29:45.720
The Japanese won't catch me.

00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.759
Before they find me,

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.079
I'll blow everything up,

00:29:58.079 --> 00:29:59.240
including this Bible.

00:30:03.119 --> 00:30:03.799
Major.

00:30:04.960 --> 00:30:06.119
I believe the Japanese soldiers

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:08.240
won't find this place for a while.

00:30:08.599 --> 00:30:09.960
It's safe here, at least.

00:30:10.279 --> 00:30:11.880
So rest and recover here peacefully.

00:30:12.319 --> 00:30:13.640
The only thing I can do now,

00:30:14.319 --> 00:30:15.119
the thing I must do,

00:30:16.240 --> 00:30:18.000
is to find a way to keep you alive.

00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:30.920
We need to find some Penicillin.

00:30:31.559 --> 00:30:32.480
If his fever continues like this,

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:33.440
it's not a solution.

00:30:33.839 --> 00:30:34.200
Alright.

00:30:35.519 --> 00:30:36.880
That Tang Juer,

00:30:37.079 --> 00:30:38.400
she works at the Japanese hospital.

00:30:38.839 --> 00:30:40.000
Let's ask her for help.

00:30:40.839 --> 00:30:41.160
Okay.

00:30:41.559 --> 00:30:42.240
Don't worry, Dad.

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.599
I'll definitely get the medicine.

00:30:43.599 --> 00:30:44.279
Be careful.

00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:48.000
Chief.

00:30:48.359 --> 00:30:49.640
As per your instructions,

00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:51.000
we have searched within our system

00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:52.519
and other war zones.

00:30:52.759 --> 00:30:53.519
So far,

00:30:53.519 --> 00:30:55.000
we have not found anyone within our system

00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:56.000
who meets our requirements

00:30:56.000 --> 00:30:57.400
and is from Sanzao Island.

00:30:57.720 --> 00:30:59.480
However, in other war zones,

00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:00.880
we found two candidates.

00:31:02.480 --> 00:31:03.480
Tell me.

00:31:03.799 --> 00:31:05.079
One is in Yichang,

00:31:05.240 --> 00:31:06.759
in Hu Lian's 18th Army direct unit.

00:31:07.079 --> 00:31:08.039
He's in his fifties,

00:31:08.039 --> 00:31:09.079
an illiterate groom.

00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:10.240
A groom won't do.

00:31:10.559 --> 00:31:11.400
Next.

00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.119
The other one's qualifications are quite suitable.

00:31:15.359 --> 00:31:16.119
Female.

00:31:16.119 --> 00:31:17.480
Born in Honolulu.

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.359
She's from Sanzao Island.

00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:22.400
Her father is the island's wealthiest man.

00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.240
She herself is a trainee military doctor.

00:31:24.440 --> 00:31:25.920
She just arrived in Chongqing.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:26.960
She was found

00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.119
on the roster submitted by the medical team

00:31:30.119 --> 00:31:32.359
of the Zengjiayan Office of the Eighth Route Army.

00:31:32.759 --> 00:31:33.799
The Eighth Route Army?

00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.279
Yes.

00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.000
Her name is Ye Biying.

00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.319
Ye Biying.

00:31:43.359 --> 00:31:44.319
No, no.

00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:45.400
Absolutely not.

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:47.359
For such a confidential matter,

00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.000
you bring me someone from the Eighth Route Army?

00:31:50.519 --> 00:31:52.000
If the old man finds out,

00:31:52.559 --> 00:31:54.119
he'll skin me alive.

00:31:54.119 --> 00:31:55.000
Chief.

00:31:55.519 --> 00:31:56.519
There aren't any others.

00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:57.920
You won't find

00:31:57.920 --> 00:31:58.920
another one.

00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:02.160
This Sanzao Island

00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:03.799
is an isolated island to begin with.

00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:05.279
Its population is sparse.

00:32:05.279 --> 00:32:06.759
Those who left to join the revolution

00:32:06.759 --> 00:32:08.319
are exceedingly few.

00:32:08.759 --> 00:32:10.240
We are trying our best to search,

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:12.440
but the prospects aren't good.

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.960
Director Li, you're here too.

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.000
You've come at the right time.

00:32:16.400 --> 00:32:17.559
Have you seen

00:32:17.559 --> 00:32:18.599
this person's file?

00:32:19.519 --> 00:32:20.359
I have.

00:32:20.799 --> 00:32:21.799
What do you think?

00:32:22.880 --> 00:32:23.960
I think she can be used.

00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:37.559
Air raid! Take cover!

00:33:02.079 --> 00:33:03.119
Ye Biying!

00:33:11.119 --> 00:33:11.640
Run!

00:33:12.359 --> 00:33:13.000
Ye Biying!

00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:18.680
I'm okay.

00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:19.319
Ye Biying!

00:33:24.559 --> 00:33:26.079
Comrade! Comrade!

00:33:26.079 --> 00:33:28.079
Have you seen Ye Biying from the 18th Group Army?

00:33:28.079 --> 00:33:28.559
Who?

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:30.799
Ye Biying!

00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:32.079
I can't hear you!

00:33:32.599 --> 00:33:33.599
Ye Biying!

00:33:33.599 --> 00:33:35.079
Ye Biying!

00:33:35.160 --> 00:33:36.599
We got separated from her.

00:33:36.599 --> 00:33:38.000
Go check over there.

00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:38.680
Go.

00:33:43.599 --> 00:33:45.440
Ye Biying!

00:33:51.440 --> 00:33:52.200
Hurry, go!

00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.160
Comrade, are you Ye Biying?

00:33:59.599 --> 00:34:01.079
Carry the child away!

00:34:01.079 --> 00:34:02.519
Save the child, quickly!

00:34:02.759 --> 00:34:03.680
Go over there!

00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.480
Over there

00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:11.519
Go over there

00:34:12.079 --> 00:34:13.159
Quickly

00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:15.559
Carry him in

00:34:16.559 --> 00:34:17.159
Come on

00:34:18.639 --> 00:34:18.920
Put him here

00:34:18.920 --> 00:34:20.079
Put him on the table

00:34:23.119 --> 00:34:24.840
Comrade, are you Ye Biying?

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:25.920
Hold him down

00:34:29.119 --> 00:34:30.079
Let go of me

00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:33.800
Let go of me

00:34:34.599 --> 00:34:35.320
Hold on

00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.079
Hold on

00:34:36.599 --> 00:34:37.480
Hold on, child

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:38.519
Press on the wound

00:34:38.519 --> 00:34:38.960
Hold on

00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.079
Hold on, child

00:34:49.079 --> 00:34:50.440
Let go of me

00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:53.360
Almost done, hold on

00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:06.440
Alright

00:35:06.440 --> 00:35:08.840
Keep pressure on him to stop the bleeding

00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:09.519
It's okay now

00:35:10.239 --> 00:35:10.960
It's okay now

00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:13.559
Are you Ye Biying?

00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.440
Our intelligence agents report

00:35:25.159 --> 00:35:26.360
Chiang Kai-shek and the Military Statistics Bureau

00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:28.000
are sparing no expense

00:35:28.000 --> 00:35:29.639
to rescue a trapped American major

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.039
They have already activated Woodcutter

00:35:32.039 --> 00:35:33.920
And they want to borrow another person from us

00:35:36.159 --> 00:35:37.039
What is Yan'an's opinion?

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.920
Yan'an has instructed to agree to this operation

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:42.119
Right at this location

00:35:42.280 --> 00:35:43.440
Yes, Sanzao Island

00:35:43.599 --> 00:35:44.280
Reporting

00:35:44.719 --> 00:35:45.400
Come in

00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:49.559
Comrade Chief

00:35:49.599 --> 00:35:50.719
Comrade Ye Biying has arrived

00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.480
Comrade Xiao Ye

00:35:57.800 --> 00:35:58.800
Hello, Chief

00:35:59.079 --> 00:35:59.320
Good

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:08.679
So you are the one from the office's

00:36:08.679 --> 00:36:10.280
medical team, Ye Biying

00:36:12.239 --> 00:36:13.320
Reporting, Chief

00:36:13.519 --> 00:36:14.039
Yes

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:14.920
Here

00:36:15.519 --> 00:36:16.400
Thank you, Chief

00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:16.639
Sit

00:36:20.079 --> 00:36:22.079
You are from Sanzao Island, Zhongshan County

00:36:23.679 --> 00:36:24.559
How old are you this year?

00:36:25.199 --> 00:36:26.320
I'm twenty-six this year

00:36:26.719 --> 00:36:27.920
In '38

00:36:28.119 --> 00:36:29.519
I went from Guangzhou Women's Normal School to Yan'an

00:36:29.519 --> 00:36:31.880
Studied medicine at the medical school guided by Bethune

00:36:32.079 --> 00:36:32.880
Last year, I was assigned to

00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.679
the medical team of the Chongqing office

00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.199
I'm still a trainee military doctor

00:36:37.519 --> 00:36:37.920
Good

00:36:39.239 --> 00:36:39.920
Comrade Xiao Ye

00:36:41.119 --> 00:36:42.119
Your recent situation

00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:43.599
I have a basic understanding

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:46.280
I'll get straight to the point

00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:47.920
The National Government's Military Commission

00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:49.360
Military Statistics Bureau

00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.239
wants to borrow you

00:36:50.599 --> 00:36:51.760
To go to your hometown

00:36:52.119 --> 00:36:53.760
To carry out a special mission

00:36:54.519 --> 00:36:56.119
I'd like to hear your opinion

00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:58.840
Military Statistics Bureau agents

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:01.880
Now is the period of united resistance

00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:03.800
The intelligence work of both parties

00:37:04.119 --> 00:37:05.639
can also cooperate

00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:07.880
But my biggest concern

00:37:07.880 --> 00:37:10.000
is that you have no experience in this kind of work

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.719
and lack the professional skills for it

00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.360
Working behind enemy lines

00:37:14.360 --> 00:37:15.559
The slightest mistake

00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:17.639
could cost you your life

00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:18.719
Chief

00:37:18.719 --> 00:37:20.000
I'm not afraid of losing my life

00:37:20.519 --> 00:37:21.320
As long as

00:37:22.039 --> 00:37:24.920
I'm not working for Military Statistics Bureau agents

00:37:28.199 --> 00:37:29.159
Comrade Xiao Ye

00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:31.920
This is not simply a matter of

00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:33.239
working for whom

00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:36.079
Now, our War of Resistance

00:37:36.679 --> 00:37:38.599
has reached a very difficult stage

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.199
This is our Chinese nation's

00:37:41.199 --> 00:37:42.679
war for survival and salvation

00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.639
What you will be doing

00:37:45.280 --> 00:37:47.599
is beneficial to the entire Chinese nation

00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:50.280
In that case

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:51.440
Chief

00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.239
I will obey the superiors' arrangement

00:37:54.119 --> 00:37:55.320
But this is a

00:37:55.920 --> 00:37:57.519
very dangerous mission

00:37:58.639 --> 00:37:59.719
I've thought it through

00:38:04.119 --> 00:38:05.360
On this return to Sanzao Island

00:38:06.079 --> 00:38:07.880
you will be another person's assistant

00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:08.920
This person

00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.000
is a top graduate

00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.199
trained by a Japanese spy school

00:38:12.719 --> 00:38:14.679
You must obey his leadership

00:38:40.239 --> 00:38:41.519
You mean to restart

00:38:41.519 --> 00:38:42.920
the investigation into Osumi Mineo's incident?

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.000
Yes

00:38:45.239 --> 00:38:46.800
Has His Majesty inquired about this again?

00:38:47.639 --> 00:38:48.239
Yes

00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.679
I thought His Majesty had forgotten this matter

00:38:57.800 --> 00:38:59.000
Who would have thought

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:06.800
Then you should go

00:39:07.239 --> 00:39:08.920
But don't take it too seriously

00:39:09.199 --> 00:39:09.920
Yes

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.320
It will involve Army-Navy conflicts

00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:14.000
It will involve Army-Navy conflicts

00:39:17.119 --> 00:39:19.719
Do not exacerbate these conflicts

00:39:20.679 --> 00:39:21.159
Yes

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:24.519
The progress of the investigation

00:39:24.639 --> 00:39:25.679
Report to me at any time

00:39:26.239 --> 00:39:26.599
Yes

00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:28.880
The Military Command

00:39:30.119 --> 00:39:31.559
will cooperate with your investigation

00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:43.559
Be careful in all matters

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:46.840
Yes

00:39:58.519 --> 00:40:00.000
You must memorize this call sign

00:40:00.159 --> 00:40:01.599
commit it to memory

00:40:01.639 --> 00:40:03.559
This is the call sign for one of our radio stations

00:40:04.239 --> 00:40:06.199
It's manned twenty-four hours

00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:07.679
When you need it

00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:09.559
you can transmit to this station

00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:11.280
We will do everything in our power

00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:12.760
to provide the help you need

00:40:14.719 --> 00:40:16.199
KSKS

00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.159
00CE333353

00:40:22.480 --> 00:40:24.280
You remembered it so quickly?

00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:26.480
I told you my memory is excellent

00:40:31.079 --> 00:40:31.519
Good

00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:33.199
Sit

00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000
Comrade Xiao Ye

00:40:37.239 --> 00:40:38.639
This is the only trump card

00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:40.519
I can give you

00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:42.719
Understood, Chief

00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:43.840
Good

00:40:44.599 --> 00:40:45.400
Comrade Xiao Ye

00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:46.880
Your time

00:40:47.239 --> 00:40:48.079
is running short

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:50.000
In a few more hours

00:40:50.679 --> 00:40:52.559
the Military Statistics Bureau will send a car for you

00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:54.239
Have Staff Officer Qiu

00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.760
give you some basic training

00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.199
This is the Military Statistics Bureau's contact for you in Shanghai.

00:41:09.199 --> 00:41:10.400
The meeting time and location.

00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:13.239
Okay.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:14.519
I've memorized it.

00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:17.119
I'll contact you at the agreed time.

00:41:17.280 --> 00:41:17.960
Also,

00:41:18.199 --> 00:41:19.800
I need some one-time-use codes.

00:41:20.199 --> 00:41:20.519
Alright.

00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:23.960
If the Metropolitan Police Department tracks down

00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:25.400
this radio set of mine,

00:41:28.480 --> 00:41:30.559
I will continuously transmit at the last moment:

00:41:30.719 --> 00:41:31.400
Wild Goose.

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:32.440
Wild Goose.

00:41:33.320 --> 00:41:34.079
Wild Goose.

00:41:35.559 --> 00:41:36.559
What about the organization?

00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:40.960
The Shanghai underground party organization

00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.440
and Teacher will send someone to meet you.

00:41:43.039 --> 00:41:43.880
If you make it to Shanghai

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:44.599
and see Teacher,

00:41:44.599 --> 00:41:45.679
be sure to give him my regards.

00:41:46.199 --> 00:41:47.519
Tell him I miss him.

00:41:52.039 --> 00:41:52.960
How long has it been since you've been home?

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:55.199
Which home are you talking about?

00:41:56.840 --> 00:41:57.480
China.

00:42:06.639 --> 00:42:07.440
Wherever you are,

00:42:07.519 --> 00:42:08.400
that's where I'll be.

00:42:11.679 --> 00:42:13.239
That place is already my home.

00:42:19.719 --> 00:42:21.519
I used to think you were quite annoying.

00:42:22.079 --> 00:42:22.960
These past couple of days,

00:42:23.519 --> 00:42:24.880
I feel you're not so detestable.

00:42:25.519 --> 00:42:26.519
After I come back,

00:42:27.159 --> 00:42:28.000
we can argue again.

00:42:28.639 --> 00:42:29.239
No.

00:42:29.719 --> 00:42:31.280
Your mouth is too sharp for that.
