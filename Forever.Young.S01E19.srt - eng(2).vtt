00:01:35.519 --> 00:01:36.319
Honey

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.599
Look at you brothers.

00:01:39.239 --> 00:01:41.319
Third Brother makes the big decisions.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:42.840
Second Brother secures investments.

00:01:43.120 --> 00:01:45.840
Big Brother just won the Duck King championship again.

00:01:46.159 --> 00:01:48.200
They're all indispensable to the roast duck restaurant.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.959
So you need to think carefully

00:01:51.079 --> 00:01:52.480
about your role and position.

00:01:53.719 --> 00:01:55.840
Only then can you show your value.

00:01:57.239 --> 00:01:58.480
Right, right.

00:02:12.159 --> 00:02:13.080
Let's go, let's go.

00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:15.639
What now?

00:02:16.199 --> 00:02:17.879
Weren't we supposed to see the doctor?

00:02:18.759 --> 00:02:19.479
I'm not going.

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:22.000
Ma Weiguo, my friend.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:23.599
Being scared won't solve the problem.

00:02:23.599 --> 00:02:24.919
Keeping a calm mindset is important.

00:02:24.919 --> 00:02:26.159
Besides, I'm here with you.

00:02:26.159 --> 00:02:26.919
What are you afraid of?

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:29.599
I'm not afraid, I really have something to do.

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.719
What's more important than this?

00:02:32.719 --> 00:02:34.039
Hurry up, you need to go.

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:34.879
If you don't go,

00:02:34.879 --> 00:02:36.560
I'll run up to the roof and shout.

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.360
I'll say Ma Weiguo has a terminal illness!

00:02:39.599 --> 00:02:40.560
Fine, go ahead and shout.

00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:41.319
Shout!

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.400
Ma Weiguo has...

00:02:44.039 --> 00:02:45.120
Aren't you going to stop me?

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.080
You want me to stop you, is that it?

00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:48.120
Ma Wei...

00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:48.719
Stop!

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.000
Hurry, let's go, we're running late!

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:53.879
Wait for me a moment.

00:02:53.879 --> 00:02:54.560
Hurry up.

00:02:54.919 --> 00:02:56.319
Come on, time is limited.

00:02:56.319 --> 00:02:57.360
There'll be traffic soon.

00:02:59.759 --> 00:03:00.639
Hurry.

00:03:02.039 --> 00:03:03.039
We're out of time!

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.560
Stop rushing me.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.439
Where is he?

00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:13.759
Coming!

00:03:13.759 --> 00:03:14.319
Let's go.

00:03:15.039 --> 00:03:15.639
Go.

00:03:26.879 --> 00:03:27.879
Let me see your tongue coating.

00:03:34.319 --> 00:03:35.080
Doctor.

00:03:35.199 --> 00:03:37.639
His condition can definitely be treated, right?

00:03:37.639 --> 00:03:39.599
Traditional Chinese medicine is, after all, vast and profound.

00:03:43.639 --> 00:03:45.639
Mr. Ma's situation

00:03:45.639 --> 00:03:47.360
still requires surgery as soon as possible.

00:03:48.199 --> 00:03:50.680
Post-surgery, combine it with TCM

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:52.280
to balance yang and resolve dampness.

00:03:52.639 --> 00:03:53.400
This way,

00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:55.680
it can also have an auxiliary therapeutic effect.

00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:58.599
Did you hear that?

00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:00.560
Thank you, Doctor.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:01.680
Wait.

00:04:02.159 --> 00:04:03.159
Since we're already here,

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.120
ask about how the auxiliary treatment works.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:06.879
Then you keep learning about it.

00:04:06.879 --> 00:04:07.840
I'll wait for you outside.

00:04:14.039 --> 00:04:14.759
Doctor.

00:04:14.759 --> 00:04:16.959
Could you tell me more specifically about this

00:04:16.959 --> 00:04:17.879
treatment plan?

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:19.279
How exactly should it be implemented for best results?

00:04:19.279 --> 00:04:20.079
Well...

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.199
What are you doing here?

00:04:47.480 --> 00:04:49.000
Same as you, to see her.

00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:51.920
No, you just got rejected by her yesterday.

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.480
Coming back for more punishment so soon?

00:04:54.279 --> 00:04:56.120
I... I still have something to discuss with her.

00:04:56.279 --> 00:04:57.399
Save your breath.

00:04:57.639 --> 00:04:58.879
She's really angry right now.

00:04:58.879 --> 00:05:00.279
She doesn't want to see us at all.

00:05:00.279 --> 00:05:02.199
I've been waiting here for over an hour,

00:05:02.319 --> 00:05:03.399
let alone you.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.120
Mr. Ma, Director Dong will see you now.

00:05:06.319 --> 00:05:06.920
Okay.

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:07.920
Wait, what about me?

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:09.120
Director Dong says

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:10.759
if you really have nothing better to do,

00:05:10.759 --> 00:05:12.040
you can keep waiting.

00:05:12.879 --> 00:05:15.439
No, there should be an order, first come first served!

00:05:31.199 --> 00:05:33.480
I remember making myself very clear to you yesterday.

00:05:34.199 --> 00:05:35.639
I won't be cooperating with you.

00:05:36.319 --> 00:05:38.399
I just want to explain my actions and reasoning

00:05:38.399 --> 00:05:39.439
to you clearly.

00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.399
We're both smart people.

00:05:41.759 --> 00:05:42.759
You've also said

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:45.040
business requires sufficient rationality,

00:05:45.279 --> 00:05:46.920
unaffected by any emotions.

00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:49.319
So please, after you hear me out,

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:50.639
then make your decision.

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.600
The reason I did this

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.800
is to tell you

00:05:56.279 --> 00:05:57.879
that the most valuable thing about Peng Le Xuan

00:05:58.199 --> 00:05:59.639
isn't just this

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.480
time-honored golden signboard.

00:06:01.759 --> 00:06:03.319
It's more likely

00:06:03.639 --> 00:06:05.079
to be every person at Peng Le Xuan.

00:06:06.519 --> 00:06:07.879
At first, I was like you.

00:06:08.480 --> 00:06:09.680
I didn't trust them either.

00:06:10.879 --> 00:06:13.680
Wang Chunsheng was lazy, lacking drive.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:15.800
As for Li Lianbao,

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:17.240
he was all talk, no action.

00:06:17.439 --> 00:06:18.639
Unwilling to do real work.

00:06:19.519 --> 00:06:21.120
Tong Qiu, needless to say,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:23.839
he just stayed in his comfort zone.

00:06:24.079 --> 00:06:25.560
He never made an effort.

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.120
Tying these three together to do something

00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.720
was simply nonsense.

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:32.160
Child's play.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.120
When they first joined forces to oppose me,

00:06:36.519 --> 00:06:37.720
kicking me out of the picture,

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.000
I was indeed extremely, extremely angry.

00:06:41.319 --> 00:06:42.720
That's why I sought cooperation with you.

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:44.839
It was just to vent my anger,

00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.439
to get back at them hard.

00:06:50.439 --> 00:06:54.839
But later, one action by Tong Qiu

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:57.519
completely changed my mind.

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:00.519
What's this for?

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.240
All these years you never charged me rent.

00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.839
I've kept track of it.

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:06.519
The rent money is all in this card.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:07.680
If there's any extra,

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:09.120
consider it making up the difference

00:07:09.120 --> 00:07:10.439
based on market rates.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.680
You never raised my rent either.

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.720
I'm aware of all this.

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:17.240
I still remember when I first returned to the country,

00:07:17.839 --> 00:07:19.519
I wanted to buy him a villa.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.680
But he refused me.

00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:23.560
That was the first time

00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:25.199
I was surprised by his actions.

00:07:36.759 --> 00:07:37.600
What's wrong?

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.480
I'm not buying the house, not buying it.

00:07:45.279 --> 00:07:46.120
What did you say?

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.560
You're not buying it?

00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.759
I think I'm still a coward.

00:07:55.519 --> 00:07:56.639
And I think

00:07:56.839 --> 00:07:59.160
taking care of Auntie is what I should do.

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.079
Right?

00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.040
For that, to take a house from you...

00:08:02.040 --> 00:08:04.319
I feel I wouldn't sleep soundly at night.

00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:06.040
At first,

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:09.279
I thought he was just cowardly, timid and weak.

00:08:09.879 --> 00:08:12.000
But after getting to know him gradually, I realized

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.160
he is someone with principles

00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:15.600
and a moral compass.

00:08:17.040 --> 00:08:19.199
He can control his inner desires

00:08:19.439 --> 00:08:20.759
and resist huge temptations.

00:08:20.879 --> 00:08:22.240
That is incredibly difficult.

00:08:23.360 --> 00:08:25.199
I've seen too many successful people

00:08:25.759 --> 00:08:28.000
who all failed because they couldn't resist temptation

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.639
and ended up bankrupting themselves.

00:08:30.759 --> 00:08:31.920
So I discovered

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.200
this strength of Tong Qiu's

00:08:34.639 --> 00:08:36.320
truly has the potential for success.

00:08:38.039 --> 00:08:39.200
Later, I thought,

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:41.039
what should I do?

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.000
Getting revenge on them would vent my anger,

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.559
but it would also mean

00:08:45.559 --> 00:08:47.000
the bet I made with them

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.240
would be a complete failure.

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.039
So I carefully recalled

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:53.200
the process of interacting with the three of them.

00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:56.240
Later, I found

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:57.840
Haven't you always wanted

00:08:57.840 --> 00:08:59.360
shares in Fengchao Tech?

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.240
Yes.

00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:03.000
Tom, you've finally come around.

00:09:03.399 --> 00:09:04.759
But I have one condition.

00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.240
Go ahead.

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:08.919
You must invest in Peng Le Xuan.

00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:10.799
Li Lianbao has resilience.

00:09:10.799 --> 00:09:12.679
He doesn't accept defeat and never gives up.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.600
He's an excellent team leader.

00:09:14.919 --> 00:09:17.080
Listen up, you little brats.

00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.279
I don't care what you think of me.

00:09:20.639 --> 00:09:22.879
I will always consider myself your big brother.

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:24.559
If the sky falls,

00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:27.759
even if this big brother gets a skull smashed to pieces,

00:09:27.759 --> 00:09:29.480
I'll still hold it up for you.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:39.320
If you keep vomiting like this,

00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:40.759
you'll damage your stomach lining.

00:09:40.759 --> 00:09:41.120
Right.

00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:41.919
Maybe we should call it a day.

00:09:41.919 --> 00:09:43.879
Yeah, Dad, let's just stop for today.

00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.080
Let's take a break.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:50.799
Let's quit for today, okay?

00:09:50.799 --> 00:09:52.720
The competition is in just a few days.

00:09:54.799 --> 00:09:56.600
Even if I vomit bile today,

00:09:57.320 --> 00:09:58.679
I have to keep tasting.

00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.919
Wang Chunsheng is responsible and loyal.

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.480
He's the spiritual pillar that unites the team members.

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.120
Actually, I have

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:11.360
some good news I haven't told you.

00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:12.480
What? What is it?

00:10:14.679 --> 00:10:15.559
I...

00:10:16.679 --> 00:10:17.919
got promoted to Assistant Manager.

00:10:18.159 --> 00:10:19.799
If you can't drink, then don't!

00:10:22.039 --> 00:10:25.480
What about our assignment then?

00:10:29.279 --> 00:10:31.159
I'll talk to Manager Chen about the assignment.

00:10:31.759 --> 00:10:33.519
No one drinks anymore! Stop drinking!

00:10:34.279 --> 00:10:35.399
Stop it, stop drinking!

00:10:35.799 --> 00:10:36.919
Tong Qiu values relationships.

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.600
He knows how to consider others.

00:10:38.919 --> 00:10:41.159
He's the soothing balm that stabilizes the team's emotions.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.039
Therefore,

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:47.879
when I came to you again,

00:10:48.840 --> 00:10:50.320
my strategy had already changed.

00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:52.919
I wanted to use your strength

00:10:53.399 --> 00:10:55.039
to make Peng Le Xuan succeed.

00:10:58.759 --> 00:11:00.159
Why did you come to me?

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.200
There are many people around you who want to cooperate.

00:11:03.759 --> 00:11:05.320
Why not use them?

00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.480
Because I only trust you.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:11.720
Many people, after getting the Peng Le Xuan brand,

00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:13.080
would only try to cash out as fast as possible.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.200
But you're different.

00:11:14.679 --> 00:11:16.919
You would invest effort and time,

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.600
to accompany those three in their growth,

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:21.360
and make Peng Le Xuan stronger.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.279
So only by handing Peng Le Xuan to you

00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:24.799
can I be at ease.

00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.200
So you tricked me hard, just once,

00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:32.639
leading me around by the nose.

00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:35.960
Why didn't you just tell me the truth from the start?

00:11:38.720 --> 00:11:39.799
Because you simply didn't believe

00:11:39.799 --> 00:11:40.919
they could change.

00:11:41.519 --> 00:11:42.440
So,

00:11:42.559 --> 00:11:44.360
I had to create an opportunity

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.360
for them to change,

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:46.559
and for you to see it.

00:11:46.799 --> 00:11:48.080
Only then would you have confidence.

00:11:52.759 --> 00:11:54.639
Now, Big Brother has won the Duck King title.

00:11:55.639 --> 00:11:57.000
With your resources,

00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.879
plus Li Lianbao's platform,

00:11:59.759 --> 00:12:01.879
they have enough strength and selling points.

00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:04.600
They will definitely have more potential for success

00:12:04.799 --> 00:12:06.440
than your current restaurant.

00:12:08.559 --> 00:12:09.840
I'll say it again:

00:12:10.519 --> 00:12:12.039
As long as you succeed once,

00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:14.279
people will forget all your failures.

00:12:20.679 --> 00:12:21.919
I trust your judgment.

00:12:23.039 --> 00:12:24.399
You will definitely make

00:12:24.919 --> 00:12:26.399
the decision most beneficial to you.

00:12:27.399 --> 00:12:28.039
Right?

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:50.720
You're still here.

00:12:52.600 --> 00:12:54.039
So? No luck, right?

00:12:54.360 --> 00:12:55.360
There's plenty of drama.

00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:57.480
She's already agreed to cooperate with me.

00:12:57.799 --> 00:12:58.559
Just wait patiently.

00:13:02.320 --> 00:13:03.080
Wait, Manager Li...

00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.200
Director Dong didn't let you in?

00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:08.679
You really agreed to work with him?

00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:10.919
Yes, I did.

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:12.159
Why?

00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.080
He tricked you so badly, led you on a wild goose chase.

00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:16.360
And you're still willing to cooperate with him?

00:13:17.159 --> 00:13:19.279
If you're so curious, go ask him yourself.

00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:21.639
No, it's...

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.360
I pleaded with you sincerely for so long.

00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.600
Won't you consider cooperating with me?

00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:30.480
Am I that unreliable in your eyes?

00:13:34.039 --> 00:13:35.159
You really want to know?

00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:36.720
Yes.

00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:51.200
What's this?

00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.320
Open it and see for yourself.

00:14:05.639 --> 00:14:07.240
My dear Qianqian,

00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:10.960
When you smile,

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:13.480
I feel all the flowers in the world bloom.

00:14:13.960 --> 00:14:15.600
The sea also surges,

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:19.279
and everything in my heart is drawn to you.

00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:22.480
You are the gentle wind in the mountain clouds,

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.759
the blazing fire on the winter prairie.

00:14:27.279 --> 00:14:30.399
You are the beautiful dream of all my years.

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.200
This is way too mushy.

00:14:36.159 --> 00:14:37.799
You've kept this love letter all this time?

00:14:37.960 --> 00:14:38.960
Who wrote it for you?

00:14:39.919 --> 00:14:41.440
Who do you think wrote it?

00:14:47.639 --> 00:14:48.759
Li Lianbao

00:14:49.759 --> 00:14:50.639
Me?

00:14:51.440 --> 00:14:53.320
I went to the time and place in the letter

00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:54.440
right on time.

00:14:56.559 --> 00:14:58.320
You really went?

00:14:58.960 --> 00:14:59.759
And I was there

00:14:59.759 --> 00:15:01.480
waiting for you a full three hours.

00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:03.039
You never showed up in the end.

00:15:06.639 --> 00:15:08.879
I mean, we were getting along so well.

00:15:08.879 --> 00:15:10.639
How could you suddenly turn so cold?

00:15:10.919 --> 00:15:12.320
You never gave me a kind look again.

00:15:13.080 --> 00:15:15.679
Can someone who does that be reliable?

00:15:17.279 --> 00:15:18.440
So because of this

00:15:18.679 --> 00:15:19.919
you hated me for so long?

00:15:20.279 --> 00:15:21.120
Not hate.

00:15:21.919 --> 00:15:23.039
Disdain.

00:15:23.519 --> 00:15:25.519
But I didn't write this at all.

00:15:26.759 --> 00:15:28.159
Don't you recognize my handwriting?

00:15:28.759 --> 00:15:30.879
Li Lianbao, are you serious?

00:15:30.879 --> 00:15:32.519
Still trying to deny it now?

00:15:32.639 --> 00:15:33.039
No.

00:15:33.039 --> 00:15:34.039
It's not like I can do anything to you.

00:15:34.039 --> 00:15:35.039
I swear

00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.399
it really wasn't me.

00:15:38.080 --> 00:15:40.200
I genuinely liked you back then.

00:15:41.080 --> 00:15:41.679
Fine.

00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.960
Okay, then who wrote it?

00:15:44.399 --> 00:15:45.039
I...

00:15:58.080 --> 00:15:59.440
That jerk.

00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.399
Who?

00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:04.759
Ma Weiguo.

00:16:06.559 --> 00:16:08.320
He wrote this with his left hand.

00:16:08.919 --> 00:16:10.919
When we were kids, we watched "The Legend of the Condor Heroes."

00:16:10.919 --> 00:16:12.759
There was a character called Zhou Botong.

00:16:12.759 --> 00:16:13.519
Remember?

00:16:13.879 --> 00:16:15.039
Ambidextrous fighting.

00:16:15.279 --> 00:16:16.519
He idolized it.

00:16:17.120 --> 00:16:18.639
He'd practice writing with his left hand for fun.

00:16:19.120 --> 00:16:21.080
Said it could develop the right brain.

00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:23.240
Let me see.

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.000
Yep, that's his writing.

00:16:27.799 --> 00:16:28.600
No way.

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.320
Let's go settle this with him.

00:16:30.679 --> 00:16:31.759
Li Lianbao!

00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:37.279
Weiguo wrote it?

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:45.919
Ma Weiguo!

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:48.559
Ma Weiguo!

00:16:52.159 --> 00:16:53.919
What's up? Done with the doctor?

00:16:53.919 --> 00:16:55.200
You have the nerve to ask?

00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.639
I had appointments with other departments.

00:16:56.639 --> 00:16:58.000
You just left without a word.

00:16:58.320 --> 00:16:59.440
Forget it, I won't argue with you.

00:16:59.759 --> 00:17:01.279
Tell me, when's the surgery?

00:17:01.879 --> 00:17:03.279
I won't waste my time on

00:17:03.279 --> 00:17:04.720
meaningless things.

00:17:05.039 --> 00:17:06.480
Fine, you said it.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:08.920
I'm calling Uncle Wang right now.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:09.640
Go ahead.

00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:10.400
I'm calling.

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.119
I'm really calling.

00:17:11.119 --> 00:17:11.920
You're really calling?

00:17:12.400 --> 00:17:13.000
I'm really calling.

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:13.400
Hang up.

00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:14.480
Hello? Hello?

00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:14.799
Hang up.

00:17:14.799 --> 00:17:15.160
Uncle Wang?

00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.279
Ma Weiguo!

00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:19.000
I'm settling all scores with you today.

00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.599
Uncle, it's not what you think, we...

00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:21.960
Not your business, go inside.

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:24.359
Go back for now.

00:17:24.839 --> 00:17:26.079
Did you write this?

00:17:28.839 --> 00:17:30.319
What did I ever do to you?

00:17:30.319 --> 00:17:31.960
Tripping me up everywhere?

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.599
Tell me, did you write it?

00:17:35.519 --> 00:17:36.400
I wrote it.

00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:39.480
Good, as long as you admit it.

00:17:40.279 --> 00:17:42.000
I'm gonna teach you a lesson today.

00:17:42.279 --> 00:17:43.880
No, no, wait, wait, wait!

00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:45.319
Ph-phone! Phone! Phone!

00:17:46.519 --> 00:17:47.400
Big Brother is calling.

00:17:47.720 --> 00:17:48.680
Big Brother?

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:49.599
Big Brother won't help you.

00:17:49.599 --> 00:17:50.319
It really is Big Brother.

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:51.440
It's really him. Big Brother!

00:17:51.440 --> 00:17:52.359
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

00:17:53.079 --> 00:17:54.079
You talk to Big Brother.

00:17:56.680 --> 00:17:57.359
Hello?

00:17:57.799 --> 00:17:59.319
Lianbao's there too?

00:17:59.519 --> 00:18:00.400
Perfect.

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:03.319
You all come over to our place for dinner.

00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:04.359
Hurry up.

00:18:04.359 --> 00:18:04.880
Okay.

00:18:06.359 --> 00:18:07.200
What did he say?

00:18:08.279 --> 00:18:09.400
Big Brother wants us at his place.

00:18:09.599 --> 00:18:10.680
I'll deal with you later.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.759
If you're willing

00:18:22.359 --> 00:18:23.559
After school

00:18:23.759 --> 00:18:27.519
Meet me at the corner by the gate.

00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:28.960
"At the corner," huh?

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:30.480
I hope to see you.

00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:31.240
Alright, alright, stop reading it.

00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:34.200
We could go to the... library

00:18:34.359 --> 00:18:35.079
Library?

00:18:35.079 --> 00:18:36.359
What would we do at the library?

00:18:36.519 --> 00:18:37.599
Go read books?

00:18:37.599 --> 00:18:38.759
Or just walk together.

00:18:38.759 --> 00:18:39.400
Don't, don't...

00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:40.079
Finish it.

00:18:40.079 --> 00:18:40.880
I haven't heard it all yet.

00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:42.119
Honestly.

00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.960
Or just take a walk together.

00:18:43.960 --> 00:18:47.680
I think, time like this would be our

00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:50.519
I think

00:18:50.519 --> 00:18:51.720
time like this

00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:53.519
would be our precious memory.

00:18:53.519 --> 00:18:55.960
Signed, Yours, Li Lianbao.

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.359
You...

00:18:59.559 --> 00:19:01.319
That's so mean of you.

00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:03.160
That's really low.

00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.160
Tell me, guys.

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.240
Should I beat him up?

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:06.319
No, no, no.

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:09.119
You should hear Weiguo's explanation too.

00:19:09.119 --> 00:19:10.119
What happened back then?

00:19:10.640 --> 00:19:11.799
Does that even need explaining?

00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:13.200
No, big brother.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:14.319
Back then, I...

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:16.279
just saw him and Qianqian getting closer.

00:19:16.279 --> 00:19:18.880
But I couldn't bear to break that thin barrier.

00:19:18.880 --> 00:19:19.920
So I gave him a little push.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:22.200
But I told you, right?

00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.720
Wait at the alley entrance after school, right?

00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:26.559
I was in a hurry to go home and do homework.

00:19:26.559 --> 00:19:27.359
When would I have time to wait for you?

00:19:27.359 --> 00:19:28.279
Cut the crap.

00:19:28.279 --> 00:19:29.720
You said back then you played every day.

00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.079
I...

00:19:30.079 --> 00:19:31.559
How could I?

00:19:31.559 --> 00:19:32.839
He was just lulling his classmates.

00:19:32.839 --> 00:19:33.440
Exactly.

00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:34.319
He told everyone

00:19:34.319 --> 00:19:35.920
he only watched TV at home, never studied.

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:38.200
But he spent more time reviewing than anyone.

00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:39.680
Why are we talking about me now?

00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:41.039
We're talking about Ma Weiguo now.

00:19:42.359 --> 00:19:44.279
Well, what's done is done.

00:19:44.279 --> 00:19:45.440
What do you say we do?

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:46.640
Yeah, what should we do?

00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:49.440
You ruined my happiness for most of my life.

00:19:49.519 --> 00:19:50.920
And you act like nothing happened.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:51.640
No.

00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:54.640
Are you so sure Qianqian would have been with you?

00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:54.920
Right.

00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:56.039
Besides, being with you

00:19:56.039 --> 00:19:58.400
might not have been happy either, right?

00:19:58.559 --> 00:20:00.039
He didn't just ruin my happiness.

00:20:00.039 --> 00:20:01.559
He ruined Qianqian's happiness too.

00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:05.200
Made Qianqian meet the wrong person and suffer.

00:20:06.519 --> 00:20:07.079
Fine.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.319
I was wrong, I apologize, okay?

00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:11.400
Hit me, curse me, do whatever you want.

00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:12.200
Alright?

00:20:12.400 --> 00:20:14.480
A very good attitude of admitting guilt.

00:20:15.839 --> 00:20:18.000
Alright, let's not talk about this now.

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:19.319
Let me tell you guys something.

00:20:19.759 --> 00:20:22.119
Ma Weiguo teamed up with this Qianqian

00:20:22.119 --> 00:20:23.240
to plot something.

00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:26.720
There's, there's actually this twist.

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:27.880
Don't talk nonsense.

00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:28.599
Isn't it?

00:20:28.599 --> 00:20:29.880
I made it clear to you.

00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.640
I had Qianqian give up Chun Jiang Shui Nuan

00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:34.720
and transfer into Peng Le Xuan.

00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.480
To bring all the backing funds and resources

00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:38.000
entirely into Peng Le Xuan.

00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:38.880
See? See?

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:40.440
Isn't this plotting behind our backs?

00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:41.759
Say whatever you want.

00:20:42.119 --> 00:20:44.000
Anyway, she's already agreed.

00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:47.039
To merge Chun Jiang Shui Nuan into Peng Le Xuan.

00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:47.960
Really?

00:20:47.960 --> 00:20:48.400
Really.

00:20:48.960 --> 00:20:51.200
No, you need to explain this clearly to me.

00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:52.559
How did you convince Qianqian?

00:20:55.759 --> 00:20:56.880
Actually,

00:20:58.240 --> 00:20:59.599
I didn't convince her.

00:21:01.039 --> 00:21:01.880
It was you guys.

00:21:05.559 --> 00:21:07.000
She saw your growth.

00:21:07.839 --> 00:21:09.319
And she saw your value.

00:21:10.079 --> 00:21:13.160
She saw Peng Le Xuan's potential even more.

00:21:13.359 --> 00:21:15.680
So it'd be weird if she didn't invest, right?

00:21:15.920 --> 00:21:16.559
Right?

00:21:28.039 --> 00:21:30.480
Here, dumplings.

00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:32.079
Super hot.

00:21:32.079 --> 00:21:32.720
Put it in the middle, in the middle.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:33.559
Thanks for your hard work, sis-in-law.

00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:35.880
The dumpling filling today

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.559
was mixed by your big brother himself.

00:21:37.559 --> 00:21:38.319
Hurry up and try it.

00:21:38.359 --> 00:21:38.799
Authentic.

00:21:38.799 --> 00:21:40.319
Come on, come on, eat.

00:21:40.319 --> 00:21:41.640
Let me say something, bro.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.240
I think our Peng Le Xuan

00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:44.759
has never been so

00:21:44.839 --> 00:21:47.480
prosperous and thriving as it is now.

00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:49.799
We should toast to big brother.

00:21:49.799 --> 00:21:51.119
No, no, no, not me.

00:21:51.119 --> 00:21:52.480
Brothers, don't toast to me.

00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.599
The reason I called everyone here today

00:21:55.880 --> 00:21:57.880
is that I feel

00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.599
us four brothers are together again.

00:21:59.960 --> 00:22:01.799
That makes me so happy.

00:22:01.799 --> 00:22:02.960
Come on, cheers.

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:04.880
Come on, come on.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.799
Here.

00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.119
Hurry up.

00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.279
Less talking, more eating.

00:22:12.279 --> 00:22:13.839
Come on, eat dumplings, eat dumplings.

00:22:13.839 --> 00:22:14.799
Come on, come on.

00:22:16.359 --> 00:22:17.400
Eat them while they're hot.

00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:18.279
Got it.

00:22:24.319 --> 00:22:25.640
Try your dad's filling.

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:35.160
I can taste it.

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:37.599
This

00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:39.480
Back then,

00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:43.680
was Auntie's favorite to make for everyone.

00:22:45.839 --> 00:22:47.799
Originally, it was because Xiao Liangzi loved them.

00:22:48.359 --> 00:22:50.240
But Auntie, every time she made them,

00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.640
she had to make a hundred and fifty, sixty.

00:22:53.119 --> 00:22:55.119
Because us brothers could eat so much.

00:22:55.119 --> 00:22:57.799
Each of us would eat thirty, forty.

00:22:59.079 --> 00:23:01.039
Back then, we'd fight over the dumplings,

00:23:02.279 --> 00:23:04.319
and even broke Auntie's plate.

00:23:04.319 --> 00:23:05.119
Right?

00:23:06.559 --> 00:23:08.200
Ever since Xiao Liangzi passed,

00:23:09.119 --> 00:23:10.400
we never had them again.

00:23:12.119 --> 00:23:14.920
Later, I learned from Auntie.

00:23:16.599 --> 00:23:17.680
Speaking of which,

00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:22.599
my first memory of Beijing

00:23:23.160 --> 00:23:24.400
was in '82,

00:23:25.279 --> 00:23:28.640
when our Peng Le Xuan reopened.

00:23:29.720 --> 00:23:31.319
My dad, my mom, and I

00:23:31.839 --> 00:23:32.920
all came back.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.559
No high-speed trains back then.

00:23:35.200 --> 00:23:38.160
Took a whole day on that old green train.

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.519
Later, when I was about to start school,

00:23:41.519 --> 00:23:43.039
Auntie told my mom,

00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:47.039
"Don't let this kid stay in the Shanxi countryside.

00:23:47.240 --> 00:23:48.559
Come back to Beijing for school."

00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.200
She took care of me.

00:23:51.559 --> 00:23:52.839
But I was just

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.720
a little kid then.

00:23:56.359 --> 00:23:58.640
Crying all day, wanting my mom.

00:23:59.599 --> 00:24:02.119
Auntie would hug and comfort me every day.

00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.119
Back then, Auntie told me,

00:24:05.119 --> 00:24:06.759
"You have to be a man.

00:24:06.759 --> 00:24:08.200
Don't cry all the time.

00:24:09.079 --> 00:24:10.400
Be a

00:24:11.039 --> 00:24:12.920
real man who stands tall."

00:24:14.119 --> 00:24:15.559
So since I was little,

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.279
I've been pretty tough.

00:24:18.559 --> 00:24:20.440
When people called me "Zhen Bao Fang",

00:24:21.519 --> 00:24:23.039
I felt so proud.

00:24:25.759 --> 00:24:28.039
But after what happened to Xiao Liangzi,

00:24:30.279 --> 00:24:31.519
I started to be afraid.

00:24:32.319 --> 00:24:33.920
Once afraid, I just...

00:24:34.359 --> 00:24:35.839
I've been afraid all these years.

00:24:37.319 --> 00:24:39.039
What I'm afraid of now is...

00:24:39.119 --> 00:24:40.480
You know, me,

00:24:41.519 --> 00:24:43.559
a dad with little schooling,

00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.200
will my son respect me?

00:24:49.799 --> 00:24:51.279
And also, all these years,

00:24:51.279 --> 00:24:52.440
these brothers...

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:55.559
I'm afraid I haven't taken good care of them.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:58.519
Furthermore,

00:24:59.119 --> 00:25:00.519
times have changed.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:02.319
Can I keep up with the times?

00:25:03.119 --> 00:25:05.599
Has my craft fallen behind?

00:25:08.359 --> 00:25:09.519
But honestly,

00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.000
I...

00:25:11.359 --> 00:25:12.759
thank you brothers.

00:25:13.559 --> 00:25:14.759
You guys

00:25:14.799 --> 00:25:15.920
pushed me forward,

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:17.920
to enter the Duck King competition.

00:25:18.519 --> 00:25:19.559
I never thought

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:23.359
I, Wang Chunsheng, could make a comeback.

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:24.400
Here,

00:25:25.559 --> 00:25:26.279
Second Brother,

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:29.640
Weiguo,

00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:31.599
Qiu'er,

00:25:33.359 --> 00:25:34.079
thank you.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:41.000
Come on, eat the dumplings.

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.000
It's been years since I tasted this flavor.

00:25:52.519 --> 00:25:53.240
Truly.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.599
Talking about Auntie reminds me.

00:25:57.839 --> 00:26:00.880
Weiguo and I were really naughty back then.

00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:02.480
Remember?

00:26:02.640 --> 00:26:04.960
Once, we were playing chess with Old Man Sun.

00:26:05.119 --> 00:26:06.559
We were about to lose,

00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:08.720
so I just swept the chessboard clean.

00:26:10.039 --> 00:26:11.839
Old Man Sun scolded me a bit.

00:26:11.920 --> 00:26:13.240
I wasn't having it.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.720
So I egged Weiguo on

00:26:14.839 --> 00:26:17.319
to pull the valve cores from Old Man Sun's bike tires.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:21.119
When Auntie found out,

00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:22.920
she gave us a good beating.

00:26:25.319 --> 00:26:26.480
After the beating,

00:26:27.799 --> 00:26:30.079
she also made us these watermelon rind dumplings.

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:34.480
I was actually really happy then.

00:26:35.359 --> 00:26:37.279
Because Auntie didn't treat us as outsiders.

00:26:37.759 --> 00:26:39.599
She wasn't polite with us.

00:26:41.839 --> 00:26:42.880
I still remember,

00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.359
she said while hitting us,

00:26:46.599 --> 00:26:47.960
"A real man

00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:50.759
isn't afraid to lose.

00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:55.839
A real man can take a loss.

00:26:57.799 --> 00:26:59.839
Cheating, welshing, not owning up,

00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.200
makes you a coward.

00:27:01.599 --> 00:27:03.440
If you lose, win it back fair and square.

00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:05.880
Harming people behind their backs

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.599
makes you the lowest of the low."

00:27:12.319 --> 00:27:13.039
Here, Qiu'er.

00:27:13.039 --> 00:27:13.720
Here.

00:27:25.079 --> 00:27:26.640
Actually, I think...

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:28.359
Auntie was really good to me too.

00:27:30.400 --> 00:27:31.599
You three,

00:27:31.839 --> 00:27:33.599
you always made fun of me as kids.

00:27:33.599 --> 00:27:35.079
Said I cried a lot, right?

00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:37.240
Big Brother would get in a fight,

00:27:38.839 --> 00:27:40.680
I'd cry seeing his bruised face.

00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:42.000
You,

00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:46.240
I'd cry when you got your "Three Goods Student" award.

00:27:46.519 --> 00:27:47.279
And you,

00:27:47.279 --> 00:27:49.720
you were always fooling around as a kid.

00:27:49.720 --> 00:27:51.799
People said you were aimless, wouldn't amount to anything.

00:27:51.960 --> 00:27:53.279
Then one year,

00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:56.079
you scored higher than him on a test.

00:27:56.440 --> 00:27:58.160
I... I cried then too.

00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.680
Only Auntie didn't laugh at me.

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:05.319
Auntie said my crying showed I valued relationships.

00:28:05.960 --> 00:28:07.440
Few could compare.

00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:18.839
I also remember,

00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:21.480
when I was little,

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.119
my parents worked abroad.

00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.519
Whenever I missed them,

00:28:28.799 --> 00:28:30.160
I'd go out to play.

00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.440
Lots of people at home would complain,

00:28:34.799 --> 00:28:36.200
telling Auntie,

00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:38.799
"You spoil him too much."

00:28:40.039 --> 00:28:40.519
But

00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.240
she never

00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.400
cared what others said.

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:50.039
She always protected me.

00:28:53.279 --> 00:28:54.359
In my heart,

00:28:56.599 --> 00:28:58.119
she was like another mother to me.

00:29:04.279 --> 00:29:05.599
Actually, Auntie

00:29:06.759 --> 00:29:09.240
was another mother to all of us.

00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:16.680
So you all need to live well even more.

00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.559
Back then, I...

00:29:22.359 --> 00:29:23.799
When I saw that digital camcorder,

00:29:25.359 --> 00:29:27.079
I really envied your bond.

00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:29.559
I think when Great-Aunt passed away,

00:29:29.839 --> 00:29:31.599
she probably didn't want past events

00:29:31.599 --> 00:29:33.319
to affect you all for a lifetime.

00:29:36.359 --> 00:29:38.119
Auntie wanted us to be well.

00:29:39.359 --> 00:29:40.759
We should listen to her.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:44.960
Otherwise, she won't rest in peace over there.

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.279
Auntie over there

00:29:51.279 --> 00:29:52.839
must have met Xiao Liangzi.

00:29:55.839 --> 00:29:57.720
Come on, brothers.

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.559
Here's to Auntie,

00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:01.079
and also to Xiao Liangzi.

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.720
Us four brothers,

00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:06.519
let's live well in this world.

00:30:08.279 --> 00:30:09.039
Cheers.

00:30:09.079 --> 00:30:09.599
Cheers.

00:30:09.599 --> 00:30:10.319
Live well.

00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:12.759
Come on, live well.

00:30:12.759 --> 00:30:14.160
Come on, come on.

00:30:18.079 --> 00:30:19.079
Come on, let's eat the dumplings.

00:30:19.079 --> 00:30:19.960
They'll get cold soon.

00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:20.920
Come on, come on, come on.

00:30:33.039 --> 00:30:34.000
Sis.

00:30:35.279 --> 00:30:37.200
You put a coin in the dumpling?

00:30:37.319 --> 00:30:38.240
You're gonna get rich!

00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:39.039
I got it!

00:30:39.039 --> 00:30:40.319
You're gonna strike it rich!

00:30:40.319 --> 00:30:42.240
I'll go buy a lottery ticket from Big Fool Yang later.

00:30:42.640 --> 00:30:44.359
I'm definitely gonna win five million.

00:30:45.519 --> 00:30:46.680
Come on, come on.

00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:48.799
Here, bro, have a drink.

00:30:48.799 --> 00:30:50.720
Come on, come on.

00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.960
It's not like counting other people's money at the bank.

00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:55.799
This time, we're counting our own money.

00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:01.039
Sister Tongtong, they made up.

00:31:01.079 --> 00:31:02.039
Look at the photo.

00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:17.880
Come on, bro.

00:31:20.119 --> 00:31:20.680
Bottoms up.

00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:21.359
Down it goes.

00:31:28.039 --> 00:31:29.799
These dumplings are so satisfying.

00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.440
We four brothers are no good.

00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.160
Four of us only drank three bottles.

00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:37.880
We should at least drink four.

00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:39.079
One bottle per person.

00:31:39.079 --> 00:31:41.599
Weiguo, you drank too little today.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:44.920
Big bro, I drank a lot for me today.

00:31:45.759 --> 00:31:47.440
Today, while I'm a bit tipsy,

00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.079
let me tell you something, big bro.

00:31:49.359 --> 00:31:51.279
Before, when I removed you as chairman,

00:31:51.279 --> 00:31:53.000
I was too willful. It was my fault.

00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:53.720
No...

00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.000
I really think you've grown, big bro.

00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:57.200
You're very different now.

00:31:57.359 --> 00:31:58.759
You should still be the chairman.

00:31:58.759 --> 00:32:00.960
No, no, no, don't sweet-talk me.

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:01.799
Let me tell you,

00:32:02.759 --> 00:32:05.799
I never wanted to be chairman from the start.

00:32:05.920 --> 00:32:07.720
If you all hadn't talked me into it,

00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:09.920
I wouldn't have done it these past few days.

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:12.680
To be honest,

00:32:12.920 --> 00:32:15.200
I still want to be the head chef.

00:32:16.839 --> 00:32:19.839
This skill passed down from Grandpa,

00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:23.400
I'll keep using it at Peng Le Xuan.

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:25.440
I'll make Peng Le Xuan successful.

00:32:25.680 --> 00:32:27.160
Good, good, good.

00:32:27.359 --> 00:32:28.440
Alright, no problem.

00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:31.759
But then who will be chairman?

00:32:33.359 --> 00:32:34.240
Second brother.

00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:35.960
You be the chairman.

00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:38.960
Big bro, it has to be you.

00:32:39.240 --> 00:32:41.519
Peng Le Xuan is your brainchild.

00:32:41.599 --> 00:32:44.680
The chairman position is yours.

00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:49.279
Well, I won't do it.

00:32:49.319 --> 00:32:51.200
Qiu'er, Qiu'er, you do it.

00:32:52.359 --> 00:32:53.640
Cut it out.

00:32:54.039 --> 00:32:56.240
As if you'd listen to me if I were chairman.

00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:57.519
Don't set me up.

00:32:57.519 --> 00:32:59.000
I'm not falling for that.

00:32:59.119 --> 00:33:01.680
Hey, Weiguo, Weiguo, come on.

00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.359
Right, how about you, Weiguo?

00:33:03.799 --> 00:33:04.960
I won't, I won't.

00:33:06.240 --> 00:33:08.680
Well, I have another idea.

00:33:08.799 --> 00:33:10.400
I want to give half of my shares

00:33:10.799 --> 00:33:12.000
to you.

00:33:12.200 --> 00:33:13.960
Then you'll be the biggest shareholder

00:33:13.960 --> 00:33:15.200
and become chairman again.

00:33:15.200 --> 00:33:17.200
You have management experience, right?

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:19.440
Besides, Peng Le Xuan

00:33:19.440 --> 00:33:21.839
originally belonged to your Ma family.

00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:24.960
Let Peng Le Xuan keep the Ma name, okay?

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.680
Big bro, it's not like that.

00:33:26.839 --> 00:33:27.440
Really.

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:29.319
I think Peng Le Xuan needs your skill

00:33:29.319 --> 00:33:30.319
to have a future.

00:33:30.319 --> 00:33:30.920
Alright.

00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.759
I really don't want the shares.

00:33:33.559 --> 00:33:36.039
No, just be the chairman.

00:33:36.039 --> 00:33:37.519
Big bro.

00:33:38.319 --> 00:33:40.920
Brothers, let's stop deferring to each other, okay?

00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:42.720
The chairman is still you.

00:33:42.799 --> 00:33:44.240
Let's follow the rules.

00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:46.960
Now we brothers are united.

00:33:47.039 --> 00:33:50.000
We'll make Peng Le Xuan flourish in the future.

00:33:50.279 --> 00:33:50.960
Deal?

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.359
Absolutely.

00:33:52.359 --> 00:33:53.880
Then it's settled.

00:33:54.039 --> 00:33:55.599
All four of us

00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:57.920
are chairmen, okay?

00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:01.880
I think Second Brother is right.

00:34:02.319 --> 00:34:04.880
Big Brother is even more right.

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:07.359
Now that Big Brother

00:34:07.359 --> 00:34:09.320
has also earned the Duck King title,

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.800
I think I should also contribute

00:34:11.800 --> 00:34:12.760
to our Peng Le Xuan.

00:34:13.639 --> 00:34:14.480
From now on,

00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.719
Peng Le Xuan's clients

00:34:17.599 --> 00:34:18.639
are my responsibility.

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:22.440
You're just bragging.

00:34:25.719 --> 00:34:28.679
Jing'er, cut up a watermelon, please.

00:34:28.679 --> 00:34:30.159
Sure thing, wait a sec.

00:34:30.159 --> 00:34:31.760
Sis, I want grapes.

00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:32.119
We really don't have any.

00:34:32.119 --> 00:34:32.960
What grapes?

00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:33.880
None.

00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:34.320
Sis.

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:36.239
Bring me that half bottle of liquor again.

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:37.440
Let's have a bit more with the watermelon.

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:37.960
Top it up.

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:39.840
Or how about we have some beer?

00:34:52.559 --> 00:34:54.599
Even without the painkillers and patches,

00:34:55.039 --> 00:34:56.719
my body doesn't seem to hurt as much.

00:34:57.519 --> 00:34:58.639
This is truly a miracle.

00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.559
Selfishly thinking,

00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:03.039
if every day were like this,

00:35:03.719 --> 00:35:04.679
a few months from now,

00:35:05.079 --> 00:35:06.719
my life would be considered complete.

00:35:09.360 --> 00:35:10.400
No, no.

00:35:10.679 --> 00:35:12.880
Their futures are still full of hope.

00:35:13.440 --> 00:35:15.920
How can I just spend days drinking and chatting?

00:35:33.639 --> 00:35:35.239
President Liu, this will definitely work.

00:35:36.039 --> 00:35:37.320
President Hu will surely be fine too.

00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:39.039
President Zhao...

00:35:40.559 --> 00:35:41.719
You're probably a long shot.

00:35:43.800 --> 00:35:45.119
It's just five, right?

00:35:45.119 --> 00:35:46.360
I've worked at the bank for ten years.

00:35:46.360 --> 00:35:47.440
I've served so many clients.

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.719
What's so difficult about this?

00:35:52.719 --> 00:35:54.400
Hello, President Song. This is Tong Qiu.

00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.760
Xiao Tong. Got a new product?

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.320
No, I'm not here to talk about the bank.

00:35:57.519 --> 00:35:58.199
It's like this.

00:35:58.199 --> 00:36:00.880
My buddies and I recently started a roast duck restaurant.

00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:01.920
The Buddies Roast Duck place.

00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:03.280
We can discuss it. Is tomorrow afternoon okay?

00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:04.440
Sure, no problem.

00:36:04.440 --> 00:36:05.719
I'll come see you tomorrow afternoon.

00:36:05.719 --> 00:36:07.000
Alright, see you tomorrow afternoon.

00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:09.000
Great. See you tomorrow.

00:36:09.039 --> 00:36:09.800
See you tomorrow.

00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.119
Why haven't you given up yet?

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:29.719
This...

00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.880
You sure you want me to say it standing at the door?

00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.039
Retreat, retreat, retreat.

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:53.480
It's like this.

00:36:53.559 --> 00:36:55.199
I booked the best in all of Beijing.

00:36:55.199 --> 00:36:56.880
The expert with the most surgical experience.

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:57.960
You need to come with me right now.

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.119
Otherwise, we'll hit traffic soon.

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.280
Do you know what this is?

00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:05.199
Glioma. Commonly known as a brain tumor.

00:37:05.559 --> 00:37:07.119
Then do you know what my situation is now?

00:37:10.679 --> 00:37:12.199
If the surgery is successful...

00:37:13.199 --> 00:37:13.840
Then...

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:14.719
Live two more months?

00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.480
Or live two more years?

00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:20.280
You've looked it up online.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.440
You should know.

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:24.639
Even if I'm lucky enough to walk out of the operating room...

00:37:24.840 --> 00:37:26.280
There will be all sorts of complications.

00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:28.920
Declining vision, declining intelligence.

00:37:29.119 --> 00:37:30.960
Epilepsy, paralysis.

00:37:31.639 --> 00:37:33.679
And the brain cancer can recur at any time.

00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.400
Do you think, with all this...

00:37:35.599 --> 00:37:36.920
I should still just muddle through living?

00:37:39.800 --> 00:37:40.920
My grandpa said...

00:37:41.599 --> 00:37:43.960
As long as a person is alive, there is hope.

00:37:44.639 --> 00:37:45.639
I don't believe that.

00:37:48.239 --> 00:37:48.800
Ma Weiguo!

00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.159
If you keep acting like this...

00:37:50.159 --> 00:37:51.400
What? You want to make a scene, is that it?

00:37:51.800 --> 00:37:53.719
Fine. Uncle Tong and the others are over there.

00:37:53.719 --> 00:37:54.480
Go tell them.

00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:55.360
I don't care.

00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.400
Look at this brat.

00:38:08.440 --> 00:38:10.199
He's offended the girl, hasn't he?

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.400
Really. Not a gentleman at all, this guy.

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:17.639
Lately, this Tongtong...

00:38:17.960 --> 00:38:20.440
They've been interacting a bit too frequently.

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:22.840
If it were kids, it'd be understandable.

00:38:22.840 --> 00:38:25.119
But this Weiguo, he's an elder.

00:38:25.239 --> 00:38:26.599
An elder.

00:38:26.599 --> 00:38:28.320
Should avoid any impropriety.

00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:31.079
Avoid what impropriety? What era is this?

00:38:31.079 --> 00:38:32.840
You're such an old fuddy-duddy.

00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:34.599
Alright, stop talking.

00:38:34.840 --> 00:38:36.199
Stop talking. Let's go.

00:38:36.199 --> 00:38:36.840
Gently.

00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.239
Remember, gently.

00:38:40.239 --> 00:38:40.960
Stop talking.

00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.480
Honestly. So annoying.

00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:47.280
Worrywart. Come on, come on.

00:38:50.719 --> 00:38:53.400
Honestly. You... you'll just...

00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:19.199
That's a foul!

00:39:28.599 --> 00:39:29.239
Dad.

00:39:29.599 --> 00:39:30.840
Don't laugh yet.

00:39:31.039 --> 00:39:31.960
You can't laugh with a face mask on.

00:39:31.960 --> 00:39:33.199
It's easy to get wrinkles.

00:39:35.119 --> 00:39:35.800
Is this okay?

00:39:35.920 --> 00:39:36.320
Okay.

00:39:36.519 --> 00:39:37.719
Then pack this up.

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:38.280
Alright.

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:38.719
Let's settle the bill.

00:39:38.719 --> 00:39:39.239
Okay.

00:39:39.239 --> 00:39:39.960
Okay, bro.

00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:41.440
Careful, Dad!

00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:43.079
That monkey is heading your way!

00:39:47.519 --> 00:39:48.199
I'm done for.

00:39:49.599 --> 00:39:50.480
Shoot him! Shoot him!

00:39:50.679 --> 00:39:51.199
Nice.

00:39:51.719 --> 00:39:52.679
Little monkey.

00:40:00.920 --> 00:40:04.760
Our company has quite a lot of business banquets normally.

00:40:05.320 --> 00:40:06.519
There's a need in that area.

00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:07.679
However...

00:40:08.119 --> 00:40:10.079
This year's contract has already been signed.

00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.119
Next year.

00:40:11.519 --> 00:40:13.599
We'll give Peng Le Xuan priority consideration.

00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:15.920
That's much appreciated.

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:16.719
So it's settled then.

00:40:16.719 --> 00:40:18.000
We'll definitely cooperate next year.

00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:19.360
Good. Let's leave it at that for now.

00:40:19.360 --> 00:40:19.840
Okay.

00:40:21.079 --> 00:40:21.639
Alright.

00:40:21.639 --> 00:40:22.440
Well, thank you.

00:40:23.440 --> 00:40:24.440
Take care.

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:33.719
First battle, first victory.

00:40:33.719 --> 00:40:34.760
Booked a client.

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.760
Agreed. Cooperation next year.

00:41:20.039 --> 00:41:21.760
Keep it up! Keep it up!
