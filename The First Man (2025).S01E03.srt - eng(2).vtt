00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.410
- Come in, quick!
- How long has she been in labor?

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.480
- About an hour.
- Okay, let me examine her.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:12.450
Breathe slowly.

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:16.390
That's it. Breathe slowly.

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.900
(Episode 3)

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.930
Oh, it sounds like the baby's here.
It's twins.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.070
- What? What do you mean?
- I'm telling you, it's twins!

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.940
There's not one but two!

00:00:58.260 --> 00:00:59.830
I don't need two babies.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:01.930
Well, what can you do?
She already had two.

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:03.840
This is getting complicated.

00:01:04.300 --> 00:01:05.900
I didn't want to raise a child
in the first place.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.070
Since it's two babies, not just one,

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:11.610
- you'll have to pay me double.
- What did you say?

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:13.780
You have beautiful baby girls.

00:01:14.410 --> 00:01:15.480
Twins.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:18.220
Girls? Not a boy?

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.450
Thank you for everything.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.050
Congratulations. Mom and the babies
are healthy, so don't worry.

00:01:38.370 --> 00:01:40.540
Hey, Kang Hyuk, we have a problem.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:43.580
Jung Suk Hee had twin girls.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.150
Two, not one! What are we going to do?

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:50.980
Hey, you said you'd take care of it,
didn't you?

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.550
So you handle it!

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:55.350
Gosh.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.520
Why can't anything just go smoothly!

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:13.940
If it's certain
that it's Dong Seok's child,

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:16.540
for how poorly I've treated you...

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:18.780
I'll make it all up to you.

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.780
Just focus on having a healthy baby.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.080
But Chairman Ma thinks
I'm only having one baby.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:27.650
What do I do?

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.120
I only need one baby.

00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:37.960
Maybe I should send one baby
to the mental hospital with Jung Suk Hee.

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:40.730
No, I can't do that.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:43.270
What am I going to do?

00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:47.440
We're in big trouble.

00:02:47.810 --> 00:02:48.810
What now?

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:51.440
I think Chairman Ma met with
the director of your OB-GYN clinic.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.180
What? And?

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:57.450
Did Chairman Ma find out
I had a stillbirth at another hospital?

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.390
No, I doubt they shared anything.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:02.050
Doctors can't just disclose
patient information.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:04.060
So he still doesn't know, right?

00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.460
Right.
When he asked if you'd switched hospitals,

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.360
I told him we were unhappy with our doctor
at the old place...

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.200
and said we were looking for a new one.
I just came up with something.

00:03:15.170 --> 00:03:18.340
Why is that old geezer
suddenly asking about that?

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.640
Is he onto us?

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:23.440
I don't think so.

00:03:24.140 --> 00:03:27.180
It seemed like he just wanted to ask
the director to take special care of you.

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:31.820
The other day he was questioning if it was
his son's child. Why the change of heart?

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.150
So now he's praying for me
to have a safe delivery?

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:36.890
That fickle old man.

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:39.460
Anyway, I made up an excuse for now,

00:03:40.260 --> 00:03:43.760
but it looks like Chairman Ma is going
to arrange a hospital for your delivery.

00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:47.300
- What are we going to do?
- This is insane!

00:03:50.800 --> 00:03:53.170
You're little angels, my absolute angels.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:56.740
So beautiful, my daughters.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:58.940
Ok Hee, Tok Hee.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:03.250
Mommy needs to give you names.
What should they be?

00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.950
My little Tok Hee has a mole.

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:08.790
How about that.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.960
Now I can tell you two apart
by this mole, right?

00:04:15.430 --> 00:04:18.400
With the way things are, we have to hurry.
We're running out of time.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.400
I'm worried Chairman Ma is going
to catch on.

00:04:21.830 --> 00:04:22.830
Kang Hyuk.

00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:27.540
Go to Seoul and watch Chairman Ma.
Whatever you do, don't let him come here.

00:04:28.110 --> 00:04:29.810
He doesn't know I'm here,

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:33.280
but that old man has a knack
for sniffing out trouble,

00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:34.680
so be extra careful.

00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:37.520
Don't make a move until I get back.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.250
The mental hospital
to lock up Jung Suk Hee...

00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:42.690
You've got it all arranged, right?

00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:44.460
Yes, don't worry.

00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:46.090
Kang Hyuk.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:49.890
You get rid of...

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.000
the other baby.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:54.970
She's a child
who never should have been born.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.970
Having another identical child
in the world...

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.140
is too big a risk with Chairman Ma.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.980
I absolutely can't risk it.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:20.360
Dong Seok.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.430
Our children...

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.360
I'll raise them for the both of us.

00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:30.570
I'll do my absolute best.

00:05:33.100 --> 00:05:34.240
So please...

00:05:35.370 --> 00:05:36.910
Please, Dong Seok...

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.180
Please come back to me, safe and sound.

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.080
Dong Seok.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.090
No matter how long it takes,

00:05:48.690 --> 00:05:49.690
I'll be waiting.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.260
Go ahead, Jung Suk Hee.

00:05:52.790 --> 00:05:54.760
You can wait all you want
in that mental hospital.

00:05:55.330 --> 00:05:57.730
And you'd better take a good long look
at your children now.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:59.760
It'll be the last time you ever see them.

00:06:03.070 --> 00:06:04.100
Ok Hee.

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:05.800
This is...

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.640
a lucky charm bracelet
Mommy made just for you.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:14.810
Tok Hee.

00:06:15.210 --> 00:06:18.850
This bracelet will bring
you both good luck.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:25.820
While you were in my tummy,
Mommy knitted these for you.

00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.230
Wear these bracelets and always be happy.

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:45.840
When Mommy's in the island's shade

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:54.390
Gathering oysters from the sea

00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:03.860
Baby is left all alone

00:07:03.930 --> 00:07:07.900
Alright. We're home.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:09.630
Okay, Tae Sook, down you go.

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.570
And you, too, Tae Pyung. Come on.
There we go.

00:07:15.870 --> 00:07:17.380
Alright, let's go inside.

00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:20.410
Hey...

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.010
How about we go visit...

00:07:22.750 --> 00:07:25.880
your Aunt Suk Hee tomorrow?

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:29.390
- Do you guys remember your Aunt Suk Hee?
- Yes, I remember her!

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.520
You do?

00:07:30.620 --> 00:07:34.890
Don't be silly. How could you remember?
You were just a baby.

00:07:35.330 --> 00:07:36.830
But Dad, I remember her.

00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:39.560
She was super pretty
and really nice to us.

00:07:39.700 --> 00:07:42.930
That's right. When you two were born,
your Aunt Suk Hee...

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:46.370
made these lucky bracelets
and put them on you.

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:51.140
Your Aunt Suk Hee will be so surprised
to see how much you've grown.

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:54.880
- Come on, let's get inside.
- Yes! Let's go!

00:07:54.950 --> 00:07:55.980
Let's go.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:16.630
Which baby should I take?

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:29.980
Goodness.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:31.450
Nurse?

00:08:32.020 --> 00:08:33.650
What brings you here this late at night?

00:08:34.950 --> 00:08:36.890
I was worried about you and the babies.

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.990
I see. I'm fine.

00:08:42.430 --> 00:08:44.560
And the babies seem fine, too.

00:08:45.330 --> 00:08:46.330
That's a relief.

00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:49.400
I'm stronger than I look.

00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:53.600
But, Nurse...

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:56.640
Have we met somewhere before?

00:08:57.610 --> 00:08:59.840
- What?
- You just look so familiar.

00:09:01.780 --> 00:09:02.980
Where have I seen you before?

00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.550
I've never seen you before.

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:07.690
You should get some sleep.
You must be exhausted.

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:12.090
Gosh.

00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:15.760
She said that nurse had a nasty temper.

00:09:16.990 --> 00:09:19.130
Looks like the old lady was right.

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.200
What was that?
She didn't recognize me, did she?

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:32.780
What's wrong, sweetie?

00:09:34.750 --> 00:09:35.810
You're running a fever.

00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.980
This isn't good.
We need to go to a hospital.

00:09:44.590 --> 00:09:45.660
And where do you think you're going?

00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.830
I think Tok Hee has a fever.
We have to get to a hospital.

00:09:49.930 --> 00:09:50.930
The hospital?

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:56.630
- Why? Is there a reason I shouldn't go?
- Absolutely.

00:09:56.970 --> 00:09:58.170
What do you mean?

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:02.010
It would be better if I took the baby
to the hospital for you.

00:10:02.610 --> 00:10:04.180
You're a new mother who needs to recover.

00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:06.410
You shouldn't be going outside.

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:11.380
You'd do that?
That would be a huge help, thank you.

00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:12.720
Please, don't mention it.

00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:17.290
- It's just part of my job.
- Hold on, let me just check her diaper.

00:10:24.800 --> 00:10:28.130
Kang Hyuk, you're on your way, right?
Get here quickly. We need to hurry.

00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:39.740
I'll be on my way.
It seems my work here is done.

00:10:43.910 --> 00:10:46.250
You know to take this to your grave,
don't you?

00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:49.920
- Of course.
- Forget everything that happened here.

00:10:50.690 --> 00:10:54.260
And you know what'll happen
if you run that mouth of yours, don't you?

00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.460
Gosh, I said I get it.

00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:58.800
You promised to pay me double.

00:10:59.160 --> 00:11:01.400
I wonder if you put a little extra
in there for me.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.210
But what should I put all this in?

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:10.940
The old lady must have a bag
or something, right?

00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:20.120
I'm just curious about something.

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.290
What are you going to do
about the mother and the babies?

00:11:23.650 --> 00:11:25.420
I'm just really curious.

00:11:28.130 --> 00:11:30.760
Listen! That's none of your business.

00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:34.570
The nerve of her!
How dare she talk to an elder like that!

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:36.970
You told me all I had to do was make sure
she delivered the baby safely.

00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:38.900
Don't tell me...

00:11:39.300 --> 00:11:42.110
- you're not stealing the baby, are you?
- Shut it!

00:11:42.370 --> 00:11:44.410
What? Steal the baby?

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:47.910
No, I'm just saying I'm curious.
They're twins,

00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:51.180
so are you taking both of them,
or just one?

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:53.380
The mother doesn't seem to have a clue.

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:56.020
- What about the mother?
- I already told you.

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.060
It's none of your business!

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:01.930
Don't you get it?
Take the money and just do what I say.

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:03.090
But still...

00:12:03.090 --> 00:12:06.430
If this is what's happening, that makes me
Chae Hwa Young's accomplice.

00:12:06.430 --> 00:12:09.500
- So I have a right to know!
- Chae Hwa Young?

00:12:10.330 --> 00:12:13.000
She's not a nurse? She's Chae Hwa Young?

00:12:13.870 --> 00:12:15.870
Chae Hwa Young, the actress?

(Couple of the Century?

00:12:27.790 --> 00:12:29.950
But, Nurse...

00:12:30.860 --> 00:12:32.960
Have we met somewhere before?

00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:36.290
- What?
- You just look so familiar.

00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:39.400
Where have I seen you before?

00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:41.370
I've never seen you before.

00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:44.440
What you need to understand is...

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.170
that what happened here is a secret
you take to your grave.

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:50.010
Don't you forget it.

00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:52.640
If you so much as open your mouth...

00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:56.950
your son won't get his treatment
and will never live a normal life. Got it?

00:12:57.250 --> 00:12:58.350
Understand?

00:12:58.450 --> 00:13:00.350
Of course I'll keep it secret.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:02.550
Otherwise, my son won't get
his treatment...

00:13:02.890 --> 00:13:04.260
and I'll end up in prison.

00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:08.890
But the thing I'm curious about is
whether you're taking both twins,

00:13:09.390 --> 00:13:12.560
or what you'll do with the other one.
That's what I want to know.

00:13:12.630 --> 00:13:16.030
- You're really starting to push it.
- Okay, I get it.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.700
You look like you could eat me alive.
I'm leaving.

00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:31.150
I don't know
if I can trust that old woman.

00:13:32.450 --> 00:13:35.190
Anyway, to get this done,
I need Kang Hyuk to get here fast.

00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:38.860
Right.

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:42.230
The remaining baby is one
that never should have been born.

00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:45.060
You have no reason to blame me.

00:13:45.730 --> 00:13:47.600
It's all because you were born
to the wrong mother.

00:13:59.110 --> 00:14:00.410
Little one. Don't cry.

00:14:01.110 --> 00:14:02.510
We have to get out of here.

00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.520
You can't make a sound.

00:14:05.650 --> 00:14:08.450
I can't let Chae Hwa Young
take you from me.

00:14:15.530 --> 00:14:17.560
Before Chairman Ma starts looking
for the hospital...

00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.260
I'd better make my move first.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.720
- Father.
- Yes.

00:14:38.450 --> 00:14:41.450
Isn't your due date coming up soon?

00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:45.890
I have wonderful news.
I just had the baby,

00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:50.690
- and you're the first person I called.
- You did?

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:55.000
You had the baby? And the baby's healthy?

00:14:55.300 --> 00:14:58.070
Yes. Perfectly healthy.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:02.510
Ok Hee, Tok Hee.

00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:04.440
Please, Mommy needs your help.

00:15:05.410 --> 00:15:07.010
We have to escape from here...

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:10.380
so please don't make a sound.

00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:24.230
Yes, Father.

00:15:28.570 --> 00:15:31.570
It's a healthy baby girl, not a boy.

00:15:35.070 --> 00:15:37.110
A daughter, not a son?

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:41.210
Yes. You know how they say
the first daughter looks like her father?

00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:44.110
She's the spitting image of Dong Seok.

00:15:45.080 --> 00:15:48.090
It's as if he's right here beside me.

00:15:48.350 --> 00:15:49.390
Is that right?

00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.920
I never understood what it meant
to be so happy you see stars,

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.930
but I get it now that I've seen
our little princess.

00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:01.670
So you thought it was a boy,
but it turned out to be a girl?

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:06.540
Everyone said it had to be a boy
from the shape of my belly,

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:08.010
so that's what I assumed.

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:12.040
To be honest, it didn't matter
to me if it was a boy or a girl,

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.550
so it's my fault
for not asking the doctor.

00:16:15.910 --> 00:16:17.150
You've been through a lot.

00:16:17.550 --> 00:16:21.620
When will I get to hold my granddaughter?

00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:26.290
I haven't fully recovered yet.

00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:29.590
I need some time to recover.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:42.310
They say I have to be careful
for the first three weeks.

00:16:42.810 --> 00:16:45.040
I'll come and see you soon, Father.

00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:07.630
Jung Suk Hee, I'm coming in.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:10.830
Where's Jung Suk Hee?

00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.600
Where did she go?

00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.070
No.

00:17:16.070 --> 00:17:17.210
No!

00:17:30.250 --> 00:17:33.920
Please, my babies, be quiet.

00:17:34.530 --> 00:17:37.660
We have to get away from here. Please.

00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:42.670
Jung Suk Hee, where are you?

00:17:43.800 --> 00:17:44.970
Jung Suk Hee, where are you?

00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:46.170
Where are you?

00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.210
Where is Jung Suk Hee?

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:51.110
What? Did she overhear everything?

00:17:52.010 --> 00:17:54.210
Is that why she caught on and ran away?

00:18:01.250 --> 00:18:03.450
Jung Suk Hee, where are you?

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:05.560
Jung Suk Hee, where are you?

00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:06.760
Where did you hide?

00:18:07.320 --> 00:18:08.330
Jung Suk Hee!

00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:11.630
Consider today the day
you and your children die.

00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:14.300
If you heard all my secrets,

00:18:15.370 --> 00:18:18.100
then even a mental hospital
is too good for you.

00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.970
Where are you?

00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:23.940
Jung Suk Hee!

00:18:24.340 --> 00:18:26.740
Jung Suk Hee!

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:40.590
She couldn't have gotten far
with the babies.

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:06.120
She has to be hiding somewhere nearby.

00:20:07.740 --> 00:20:10.480
I told you to hurry!
Do you ever listen to me?

00:20:10.750 --> 00:20:12.180
What took you so long?

00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:14.550
What happened? What's wrong?

00:20:15.350 --> 00:20:16.520
This is bad.

00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:19.220
That Jung Suk Hee took the babies
and disappeared.

00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:22.090
She must have figured everything out.
She just vanished into thin air.

00:20:22.160 --> 00:20:23.630
What do you mean, she figured it out?

00:20:23.630 --> 00:20:25.100
How did this happen?

00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:28.670
Is that really the problem right now?
We have to find Jung Suk Hee, and fast.

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:30.900
Or else this whole thing will fall apart.

00:20:31.270 --> 00:20:33.700
We have to find her
and shut her up, no matter what.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:37.510
She couldn't have gotten far.
I'll find her, so don't worry.

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.240
How can I not worry?

00:20:40.010 --> 00:20:41.080
Just find her, now!

00:20:41.580 --> 00:20:43.650
Find her! My life depends on it.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:47.620
- Everyone, this way.
- Yes, sir.

00:21:30.260 --> 00:21:31.260
Chae Hwa Young.

00:21:31.660 --> 00:21:34.230
I'm sure I saw an article
saying she was pregnant,

00:21:35.070 --> 00:21:36.470
so what happened to her own baby?

00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.370
Why would she want to take
my children now?

00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:44.510
No one knew I was pregnant.
How could she have known?

00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:46.410
Chae Hwa Young...

00:21:47.080 --> 00:21:48.850
I never knew you could be so cruel.

00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:57.720
No, little ones.
Please, don't make a sound.

00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:02.430
Babies, please help Mommy.
We have to survive.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:06.460
Dong Seok. Help me.

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:10.970
Hush now, little ones.

00:23:06.690 --> 00:23:07.720
Jung Suk Hee.

00:23:08.260 --> 00:23:11.560
I lost my baby because of you.
All because of you.

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.870
If it hadn't been for you back then,

00:23:57.410 --> 00:23:58.910
my baby would still be alive.

00:24:00.180 --> 00:24:01.950
So, your baby is mine now.

00:24:05.120 --> 00:24:07.220
I will find the baby. I swear it.

00:24:08.120 --> 00:24:10.090
That baby is my lifeline.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.270
Is anybody there?

00:25:02.910 --> 00:25:07.040
Help! Is anyone here? Please, help me!

00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:10.110
What do I do?

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:12.320
Hello? Is anyone out there?

00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:14.120
Wait! Hold on.

00:25:16.650 --> 00:25:18.620
- Did you guys hear that?
- Help me!

00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:20.260
Is anybody there?

00:25:21.830 --> 00:25:22.990
Somebody, save me!

00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:29.730
Help me! Over here! Is anybody here?

00:25:29.730 --> 00:25:31.100
Somebody, save me!

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:41.110
I have to get to town.
I'll be safer around other people.

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:44.380
Please, let there be a car passing by.

00:25:50.820 --> 00:25:53.360
You still have a high fever.
What am I going to do?

00:25:54.590 --> 00:25:56.830
Sweetheart, please don't be sick.

00:25:59.560 --> 00:26:02.570
No, little ones.
Please, be strong for Mommy.

00:26:03.070 --> 00:26:05.470
I will never let Chae Hwa Young
take you from me.

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:06.940
Hush now.

00:26:07.500 --> 00:26:10.070
Quiet, quiet.

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:38.770
A pay phone!

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:44.340
My babies, we're saved.

00:26:57.790 --> 00:27:00.860
- Hey, there she is! Over there!
- Gosh, darn it!

00:27:15.510 --> 00:27:16.570
Where's my money?

00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.240
I'm sure I wrapped the money
in my handkerchief.

00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:26.380
This is bad.

00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:28.180
We have to find Jung Suk Hee, and fast.

00:27:28.450 --> 00:27:30.950
We have to find her
and shut her up, no matter what.

00:27:36.230 --> 00:27:37.360
Now what do I do?

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.560
I need a coin to make a call.

00:27:40.300 --> 00:27:43.230
Babies, what are we going to do now?

00:27:58.280 --> 00:27:59.320
Is anybody there?

00:28:00.020 --> 00:28:01.120
There she is!

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:22.740
(Filming with newborns was conducted...)

00:28:22.740 --> 00:28:24.040
(under parental supervision
with safety and rest.)

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.790
(The First Man)

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:40.720
Stop the car! Please, hurry!
If they catch us, we're dead!

00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:43.960
Should I have let him
marry the girl he loved?

00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:45.960
Maybe I should try to find her, even now.

00:28:46.030 --> 00:28:50.330
If that sly fox Chairman Ma finds out,
all our work will be for nothing.

00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.170
If I get caught now,
my Ok Hee will be in danger.

00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:54.870
Whatever it takes,
I have to buy more time.

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:57.910
