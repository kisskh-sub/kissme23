00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:09.120
Madam.

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:10.510
You haven't recovered yet.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:11.760
You should lie down and rest.

00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:13.350
It's all right.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.790
Madam.

00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:18.680
I heard that Nanny Sun
knelt until her legs gave out.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:20.710
The old Madam,
recalling her years of service,

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.680
gave her some money and sent her away.

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.790
But fate had it that
she met mountain bandits on the road.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.350
She lost her life along the way.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:30.280
Every thought and intent has its cause.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.000
What we face now is but the result.

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:39.070
Once, they held the knife,
and I was the prey.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.640
Now it's my turn to let them taste

00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:47.070
the helplessness that once bound me.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.040
- General.
- General.

00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:00.580
I have military duties to attend to.

00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.860
Tomorrow, I'll be away for a few days.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.170
I've had someone investigate
the Scorpion Venom.

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:05.870
Take good care of yourself.

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:08.680
Thanks, General.

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:19.240
General.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.400
Let me help you rest.

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.840
No need.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.150
I don't want you to compromise yourself.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.630
Such an relationship
doesn't interest me.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:32.200
I help you

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:33.710
because I have my own reasons.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.150
I feel no grievance.

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:40.080
I have always been your wife.

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:42.630
Besides, I think you're right.

00:02:43.870 --> 00:02:44.750
From now on,

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:46.750
I must live for myself.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:52.680
What do you want me to do?

00:02:54.560 --> 00:02:57.190
I want to be the lady of the house.

00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:09.080
Nuan'er.

00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:11.200
Nuan'er!

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:14.430
Madam.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.230
Where did this medicine come from?

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.080
The kitchen servants brewed it.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:19.190
What's wrong, Madam?

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.120
It's just a bowl of herbal water,
with senna leaves added.

00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.710
Madam, you haven't recovered yet.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:24.910
How dare they do such a thing!

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.430
I'll confront them now.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:31.240
Madam, We came to bring you
silver and charcoal.

00:03:33.560 --> 00:03:34.400
Wait!

00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:37.120
The official allowance for the wife
is twenty taels each month.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:38.870
Why has Madam received only ten taels?

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:40.870
We were simply following

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:41.840
Concubine Qin's orders.

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.300
Then what about the charcoal?

00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:44.520
According to the rules,

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:45.470
Madam

00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:47.050
should receive the finest
Silver Bone Charcoal.

00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.180
How could she be using Black Charcoal
like in the kitchen?

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.150
Besides, this isn't even a full jin.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:52.630
It won't last through the day!

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:55.520
Madam, we only have Black Charcoal now.

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:57.590
And when the charcoal
was first burned this year,

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:58.950
there was naturally less to go around.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:01.240
If you are unhappy,
bring it up with Concubine Qin.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:03.590
We maids are only following orders.

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:05.960
Oh right, Madam.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.360
If you know it's cold outside,
don't sit out there.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:10.430
Stop right there!

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:11.400
Come back.

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.030
Madam.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.120
Concubine Qin has gone too far.

00:04:16.270 --> 00:04:17.190
They clearly

00:04:17.190 --> 00:04:18.750
are trying to wear you down completely.

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.360
The more outrageous she acts,
the better.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.390
A dog that bites doesn't bark first.

00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.720
Madam, have you finished calculating?

00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:36.070
It's merely ten taels of silver a month.

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.630
Even if we eat porridge
and pickled vegetables every day,

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.310
we'd still spend
more than ten taels each month.

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:42.510
Add in rouge and face powder,

00:04:42.600 --> 00:04:43.870
and the daily use of incense
and candles,

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.270
how could ten taels a month
ever be enough?

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:48.990
Since Concubine Qin took over
the household,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.310
her deductions have become
far too harsh.

00:04:50.630 --> 00:04:51.950
You're still a concubine, after all.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.390
How could you endure such humiliation?

00:04:53.750 --> 00:04:54.630
That's just how it is.

00:04:55.040 --> 00:04:56.660
I've heard Madam's situation
isn't any better either.

00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:58.360
To survive in this inner chambers

00:04:58.360 --> 00:04:59.360
is already no small feat.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:00.800
But...

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.120
We can't be living on only mantou
and pickled vegetables forever.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.270
The General isn't home.

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:08.920
Why don't you go and speak
with the Old Madam?

00:05:10.510 --> 00:05:11.950
She refuses to even see me.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.430
How could I possibly get a word in?

00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:17.670
Xiaoru.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:21.120
There are some fine rouge
and face powder in my dowry.

00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:22.870
Take them and pawn them all.

00:05:23.390 --> 00:05:24.230
Madam.

00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:25.830
How did things come to this?

00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:26.920
Using your own dowry?

00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.680
Indeed, how did it come to this?

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:42.950
Madam, what brings you here?

00:05:43.480 --> 00:05:44.320
Honestly,

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:45.520
I've been here for quite some time.

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.720
Then you must've heard

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.270
every word I said, haven't you?

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.430
Don't worry. Sit down and talk.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:54.480
I'd better not sit.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.070
You're good at arithmetic.

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:00.070
When I lived with my own family,

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.570
I often help my father
check the account books.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:02.870
This is just a piece of cake.

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.600
Then, could you do me a favor?

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:07.300
It would be helping yourself.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:10.390
What do you want me to do?

00:06:14.390 --> 00:06:16.870
Today isn't the usual day for distributing
the monthly stipends.

00:06:17.510 --> 00:06:19.950
Why are you here so early to visit me?

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.800
I've just come up with a new idea.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:25.240
To select a few capable servants
to act as stewards.

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:26.560
We'll hand over
the servants' wages to them,

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.770
and let them handle the distribution.

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:29.190
This way,

00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.040
the efficiency will improve greatly,

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.480
and daily management
will become much easier.

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.560
I truly didn't

00:06:36.750 --> 00:06:38.600
choose the wrong person for this task.

00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:40.920
Old Madam, that compliment

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:42.390
seems a bit premature.

00:06:48.870 --> 00:06:49.750
Shen,

00:06:50.190 --> 00:06:51.720
what do you mean by that?

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:53.030
Madam.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:06:54.820
I know you're dissatisfied
that the Old Madam has put me

00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:55.990
in charge of managing the household.

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:57.030
But...

00:06:57.630 --> 00:06:59.750
You shouldn't speak to Old Madam
like that.

00:07:00.310 --> 00:07:01.150
Concubine Qin.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:03.750
You should look through these

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:05.040
before trying to defend yourself.

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.390
What's going on with them?

00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.110
Zhang Jun.

00:07:22.070 --> 00:07:23.070
On the ninth of last month,

00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.240
he brought a courtesan
from Hongxiu Pavilion home.

00:07:25.750 --> 00:07:27.270
Didn't show up for work
until midday the next day.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:30.510
Yesterday, drunk again,
he broke a potted iron tree.

00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:33.030
Sun Bao'er.

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.750
On the thirteenth last month, after breaking
a glazed glass vase in the side yard,

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:38.990
she had someone glue it together
and tried to pass it off as intact.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:40.680
Tang Xiaowan.

00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:43.990
She withheld the allotted
Silver Bone Charcoal from each courtyard

00:07:44.070 --> 00:07:45.630
and secretly sold it
at the northern market.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.680
Madam, I swear I won't dare again.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.390
In truth, a little attentiveness
would've uncovered this.

00:07:52.310 --> 00:07:54.000
I had thought Concubine Qin

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.430
was planning to settle accounts later.

00:07:55.800 --> 00:07:56.640
But to my surprise,

00:07:57.040 --> 00:07:59.160
these people
not only escaped punishment,

00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.390
they were even promoted.

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:03.440
Old Madam,

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.160
I had no idea about these things.

00:08:05.510 --> 00:08:06.830
If I'd known they were doing wrong,

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:08.360
I definitely wouldn't have allowed it.

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:10.230
Is that so?

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.920
Then this false ledger
was the work of the servants too?

00:08:18.430 --> 00:08:19.950
Bring it here and let me see.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:26.260
(Ledger)

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:33.560
Ever since Concubine Qin
took charge of household finances,

00:08:33.790 --> 00:08:35.670
she raised the monthly allowance
for the servants.

00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:37.600
According to the ledger,

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.150
the total monthly allowance

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:41.840
for everyone in Li Manor
is one hundred and sixteen taels.

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.060
Even the pole carrier,
who gets the smallest monthly wage,

00:08:44.480 --> 00:08:45.720
receives at least one tael each month.

00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:47.240
But when I asked them,

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:50.030
they said they only received three qian.

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:54.230
Old Madam,

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.030
I really only received
three qian this month.

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.150
At first, I thought
I had done something wrong,

00:09:00.840 --> 00:09:02.630
but Madam found out after asking around.

00:09:03.150 --> 00:09:05.200
Someone had been withholding our wages!

00:09:06.270 --> 00:09:08.080
Old Madam, please punish them

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:10.670
and help me get justice!

00:09:12.120 --> 00:09:13.240
Old Madam, please see the truth.

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:15.550
Yes, I did steal from the manor before,

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:17.440
but I never once took anyone's wages!

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:20.030
Nor did I!

00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:21.550
I distributed the wages according to

00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.910
Concubine Qin's accounting.

00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.720
Not a single coin short.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:27.000
So if that's the case,

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:30.030
Li Manor should still have
over seventeen hundred taels.

00:09:30.270 --> 00:09:32.320
There's less than seven hundred taels
left on the accounts now.

00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:33.840
If it wasn't you all who did this,

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.600
then who took

00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:37.200
the one thousand taels?

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:38.600
Who else could it be?

00:09:39.390 --> 00:09:41.550
You promoted someone
who'd made mistakes to be in charge,

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.360
just so you could make them
do your bidding.

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:45.630
Don't you dare slander me!

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.340
The family rules of Li Manor state

00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:52.450
that anyone using public funds
for personal gain

00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:53.700
will be kicked out and sent to prison.

00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.320
Old Madam,

00:09:56.910 --> 00:09:57.750
please see the truth.

00:09:59.000 --> 00:09:59.990
Old Madam, please see the truth.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:01.750
You're welcome to search my room.

00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:03.720
If I really took that thousand taels,

00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:05.190
there would surely be evidence
in my room!

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:16.580
(Ledger)

00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:29.440
You are wise as always.

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:32.200
Or Concubine Qin would've gotten us
into real trouble.

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:34.860
She grew arrogant and careless
after her small triumphs.

00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:35.950
Her mistakes
were easy to uncover.

00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:39.790
Still, it's thanks to
your great accounting skills.

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:41.270
Otherwise,

00:10:41.270 --> 00:10:43.000
we wouldn't have resolved this matter
so easily.

00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:44.910
You're too kind.

00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:47.720
Yet, the Old Madam chose
not to hand down any punishment.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.370
Is she trying to
just let this matter slide?

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:52.440
The missing thousand taels
still haven't been recovered.

00:10:53.270 --> 00:10:54.720
There's truly no proof to confirm

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:56.200
that Concubine Qin kept them.

00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.030
I must come up with another plan.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:05.200
Concubine Qin may look gentle and frail,

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.600
but she's so heartless.

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:08.840
Given her character,

00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:11.720
I doubt she'll let this go so easily.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.820
(Li Manor)

00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.150
Madam, I think it's Concubine Qin.

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:29.440
Pretend to be me for now

00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:31.030
and go lie on my bed.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.720
Don't come out until I get back.

00:11:33.510 --> 00:11:34.350
Madam.

00:11:34.630 --> 00:11:35.840
Are you planning to follow them?

00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:36.910
Isn't this...

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:38.550
Don't worry. I'll be fine.

00:11:38.550 --> 00:11:39.390
Go now.

00:11:39.750 --> 00:11:40.590
Madam.

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.580
(Yongle Bank)

00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:24.900
(Yongle Bank)

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.120
Pretty one, don't run.

00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:49.670
Just be good and give in to me.

00:12:54.390 --> 00:12:55.600
There's a bed right over there.

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:59.360
You certainly know how to have fun.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.360
Here I come.

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:24.030
The air is dry and the winds fierce.

00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.030
Be cautious with the fire.

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.720
The air is dry and the winds fierce.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:31.670
Be cautious with the fire.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:38.600
You can't even handle a woman.

00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:40.080
Useless fool.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:41.680
Who could've known

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.320
that woman would be so fierce.

00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:47.200
I got hit in the head.

00:13:47.390 --> 00:13:48.320
You'll have to pay me more!

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.510
I can pay you more.

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:04.440
But you must help me with another act.
