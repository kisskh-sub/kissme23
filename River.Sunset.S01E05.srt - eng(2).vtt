WEBVTT

00:01:46.079 --> 00:01:46.439
Sir

00:01:46.519 --> 00:01:47.400
Your clothes have been delivered.

00:02:23.639 --> 00:02:25.280
Good morning, Colonel Takeki.

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:25.960
Good morning.

00:02:27.159 --> 00:02:29.319
This is the Chief of Staff of the Shanghai Garrison,

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:30.639
Major General Yasuo Tanikawa.

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:34.000
This is Mr. Inoue Akira.

00:02:36.199 --> 00:02:38.319
I am the General's aide.

00:02:39.639 --> 00:02:40.120
Please, come in.

00:02:41.759 --> 00:02:44.639
Commander Shigeru Sawada has gone to Nanjing.

00:02:45.199 --> 00:02:48.159
I heard someone from the Imperial Palace had arrived,

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.319
so I had to come see you.

00:02:50.719 --> 00:02:51.919
So early.

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:53.759
I hope I'm not disturbing you.

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:54.960
Of course not.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:55.919
General, please.

00:02:55.919 --> 00:02:56.360
Alright.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.520
I checked the registration records.

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:13.240
They were received several days ago.

00:03:13.719 --> 00:03:16.199
The Army General Staff's notification.

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:20.319
After Commander Sawada made his notation,

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:22.840
he left for Nanjing.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.159
I neglected you, Colonel.

00:03:27.439 --> 00:03:30.599
That's why Mr. Inoue had

00:03:30.599 --> 00:03:32.759
a conflict with the Colonel.

00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:34.039
Takeki,

00:03:34.439 --> 00:03:36.680
I am truly sorry.

00:03:36.879 --> 00:03:37.840
Not at all, General.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.159
It's quite alright.

00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.439
Regarding intelligence channels,

00:03:40.439 --> 00:03:41.560
someone has been looking after me.

00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.680
It's Major Takizawa from the Intelligence Section, right?

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.400
You two were classmates, I believe?

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:49.800
Yes.

00:03:54.039 --> 00:03:57.159
I've dreamt countless times

00:03:57.159 --> 00:04:00.360
of my first night with him.

00:04:00.759 --> 00:04:01.879
And now,

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.199
my mission

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:06.039
forces me to share a room

00:04:06.039 --> 00:04:09.039
with a strange man.

00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:18.360
You intelligence people are always so tight-lipped.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:21.959
Major Takizawa didn't report it either.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.319
I hadn't heard a single whisper about it.

00:04:24.319 --> 00:04:25.480
My sincere apologies.

00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:26.879
I instructed him to do so.

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.160
Please.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:38.720
Yes.

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.920
I know you've come all the way to Shanghai, Colonel,

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.240
undoubtedly on a vital mission from His Majesty.

00:04:53.399 --> 00:04:56.160
It's not my place to inquire further.

00:04:56.839 --> 00:04:59.879
But if there's anything you need from me,

00:04:59.879 --> 00:05:02.959
I will provide my full cooperation.

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:03.839
Very well.

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.519
How long do you plan to stay in Shanghai, Colonel?

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:09.839
My business in Shanghai

00:05:09.839 --> 00:05:11.120
is largely complete.

00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.360
There happens to be a ship tonight

00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:15.120
bound for the Sixth Air Base.

00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.639
I have some matters to attend to there.

00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:18.279
I would also request your department

00:05:18.279 --> 00:05:20.120
to provide me with two special passes

00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:21.360
and the best cabin accommodations.

00:05:22.639 --> 00:05:24.639
I will handle this matter.

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.399
Since our Intelligence Section's

00:05:27.399 --> 00:05:29.600
advisor, Major Takizawa, has been

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:32.160
secretly accompanying the envoy these past few days,

00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:34.480
I'll call the Kempeitai.

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:35.680
It's best if Major Takizawa

00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:36.920
accompanies you to take care of it.

00:05:37.040 --> 00:05:38.000
Thank you, Your Excellency.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.959
I leave it all in your hands.

00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:42.920
Colonel.

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.240
Do you understand English?

00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:47.639
A little.

00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:51.160
My son mentioned

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:52.480
that the commander of the Sixth Air Base,

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:53.519
Mr. Fujita,

00:05:53.519 --> 00:05:55.240
is also quite knowledgeable in English.

00:05:55.879 --> 00:05:56.360
Indeed.

00:05:56.839 --> 00:05:58.959
This book is what I'm taking to the island

00:05:58.959 --> 00:06:00.240
to present to Commander Fujita.

00:06:02.279 --> 00:06:06.360
A book from the Colonel for Commander Fujita

00:06:06.839 --> 00:06:09.439
must be quite insightful.

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:12.279
May I take a look?

00:06:13.199 --> 00:06:13.680
Of course.

00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:14.600
Certainly.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:29.399
It seems Commander Fujita is quite accomplished.

00:06:31.279 --> 00:06:31.680
Yes.

00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:36.199
I'll buy a copy to read the day after tomorrow.

00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:40.160
Such a fine book.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:42.879
Might I also have a look?

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:52.399
Please, look.

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:09.240
Mr. Inoue.

00:07:09.439 --> 00:07:11.680
Do you really understand it?

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.360
The words on it recognize me,

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.959
but I don't recognize them.

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.959
I have a subordinate who knows English, though.

00:07:21.959 --> 00:07:23.800
He can read it to me.

00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:28.199
What's written on this paper?

00:07:28.199 --> 00:07:28.800
Wait.

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.240
Hold on.

00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:34.600
Last night, I was reading this book

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.319
and happened to reach this page.

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:37.399
Afraid I'd forget,

00:07:37.399 --> 00:07:38.399
I took a piece of paper

00:07:38.399 --> 00:07:39.639
and placed it here as a bookmark,

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:41.360
so I could continue reading next time.

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:42.879
Mr. Inoue.

00:07:42.959 --> 00:07:44.120
If you'd like to read it, you can take it first.

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.800
When I return to Shanghai next time,

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:47.600
I'll come to you to retrieve it.

00:07:48.399 --> 00:07:49.920
No, that won't be necessary.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.519
I wouldn't dare take something

00:07:52.519 --> 00:07:54.079
you're giving to Commander Fujita.

00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:54.879
Alright.

00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:57.800
Colonel.

00:07:57.800 --> 00:07:58.399
Yes.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:00.279
Tonight,

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:01.480
I would like, on behalf of

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.000
the Shanghai Garrison Commander Shigeru Sawada, to host

00:08:03.279 --> 00:08:04.759
a banquet in your honor, Colonel.

00:08:04.879 --> 00:08:07.240
To fulfill my duty as your host.

00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:08.360
Thank you, Your Excellency.

00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:10.399
However, tonight

00:08:10.399 --> 00:08:12.040
I have already arranged to meet a very important guest,

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.160
and I must board a ship tonight

00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.439
for the Sixth Naval Base.

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:15.199
Therefore,

00:08:15.519 --> 00:08:16.199
next time,

00:08:16.519 --> 00:08:18.160
when I return,

00:08:18.439 --> 00:08:19.439
we shall drink until we're thoroughly drunk.

00:08:20.959 --> 00:08:22.680
That will be acceptable.

00:08:23.519 --> 00:08:25.600
By then, Commander Sawada

00:08:25.600 --> 00:08:27.519
should have returned to Shanghai.

00:08:28.279 --> 00:08:28.959
Mr. Inoue.

00:08:29.839 --> 00:08:31.319
I will be leaving tonight.

00:08:31.439 --> 00:08:33.159
Please instruct your men to stop following me.

00:08:33.159 --> 00:08:33.960
Is that acceptable?

00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.279
Mr. Inoue.

00:08:37.279 --> 00:08:39.799
Is this true?

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:41.240
This must not happen again.

00:08:41.519 --> 00:08:41.919
Alright.

00:08:42.519 --> 00:08:43.360
I understand.

00:08:54.399 --> 00:08:54.960
Come out.

00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:55.759
They're gone.

00:09:07.879 --> 00:09:09.320
That was truly terrifying.

00:09:22.279 --> 00:09:23.279
I'm sorry.

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:33.240
What is this?

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:35.399
What right do you have to enter my room?

00:09:36.279 --> 00:09:37.480
Getting to know each other, you said.

00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.559
What about the original one?

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:41.600
Threw it away.

00:09:41.679 --> 00:09:42.279
Flushed it down the toilet.

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:44.559
So...

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.000
You saw it.

00:09:46.759 --> 00:09:47.320
Childish.

00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:50.759
That was my property.

00:09:50.759 --> 00:09:51.639
How could you just take it?

00:09:51.639 --> 00:09:53.360
Didn't your superior tell you before coming?

00:09:53.519 --> 00:09:54.000
That nothing...

00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:55.159
...is to be recorded in writing.

00:09:55.159 --> 00:09:55.720
Did he or not?

00:09:56.639 --> 00:09:57.639
Well, didn't your superior tell you...

00:09:57.639 --> 00:09:58.960
...not to take other people's things?

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:00.279
Therefore...

00:10:02.960 --> 00:10:03.279
It's mine.

00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:04.159
What are you doing?

00:10:05.080 --> 00:10:05.360
Flushing it.

00:10:05.399 --> 00:10:05.840
What are you doing?

00:10:05.840 --> 00:10:06.279
Give it back to me!

00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.240
That was a sketch of me sleeping.

00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.639
You can't show it to anyone.

00:10:08.639 --> 00:10:09.240
Give it back!

00:10:12.279 --> 00:10:13.240
Takeki Ichiro!

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.120
Give it back!

00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:18.919
Where is it?

00:10:20.679 --> 00:10:21.960
Change clothes. We're going out.

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:35.279
Any progress with the special envoy?

00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:36.960
Major Ferguson...

00:10:36.960 --> 00:10:38.679
...has arrived at our base in India.

00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.039
But after Japan invaded Burma...

00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.519
...all air and land routes were cut off.

00:10:43.799 --> 00:10:44.679
Once the new route is ready...

00:10:44.679 --> 00:10:46.039
...we can prepare to depart.

00:10:46.039 --> 00:10:48.000
The situation is becoming clearer.

00:10:48.519 --> 00:10:49.720
Darn it, the Himalayas.

00:10:50.799 --> 00:10:52.840
I don't know how a plane is supposed to fly over them.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:53.399
Sir.

00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:55.399
Have faith in our pilots.

00:10:55.639 --> 00:10:56.679
I'll figure out a way, for sure.

00:10:57.279 --> 00:10:58.399
Speaking of pilots...

00:10:58.399 --> 00:10:59.960
...how are Doolittle and his boys doing?

00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.799
Lieutenant Colonel Doolittle and his men are preparing...

00:11:01.799 --> 00:11:03.840
...for B-25 takeoffs from a carrier deck.

00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.840
Tomorrow, they fly to Sacramento...

00:11:05.840 --> 00:11:06.320
...to continue training.

00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.279
Tell Doolittle...

00:11:08.279 --> 00:11:09.600
...this operation must be foolproof.

00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:12.600
The Japanese are about to take the Philippines.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.600
I want this raid to happen as soon as possible.

00:11:15.799 --> 00:11:16.639
Call him now.

00:11:16.639 --> 00:11:17.039
Yes, sir.

00:11:21.519 --> 00:11:21.879
Sir.

00:11:21.879 --> 00:11:23.679
We've made the following necessary modifications.

00:11:23.919 --> 00:11:25.600
Removed the ventral turret...

00:11:25.639 --> 00:11:27.360
...replaced with a fifty-gallon fuel tank.

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:30.399
Added four auxiliary fuel tanks...

00:11:30.399 --> 00:11:32.159
...bringing each plane's total fuel capacity...

00:11:32.159 --> 00:11:34.200
...to one thousand one hundred forty-one gallons.

00:11:35.120 --> 00:11:36.399
Modified the bomb sights...

00:11:36.399 --> 00:11:38.399
...for low-altitude bombing.

00:11:38.960 --> 00:11:40.840
Installed a small camera in the tail.

00:11:42.039 --> 00:11:44.240
Removed much of the radio equipment...

00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:45.960
...to reduce weight.

00:11:46.639 --> 00:11:48.039
Also added de-icers on the wings.

00:11:48.039 --> 00:11:48.360
Correct?

00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:48.759
Correct.

00:11:49.399 --> 00:11:51.879
Good. Finally...

00:11:53.399 --> 00:11:54.120
Finally, what?

00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:58.279
The tail gun...

00:11:58.639 --> 00:12:01.600
...replaced with a painted wooden dowel.

00:12:02.159 --> 00:12:04.080
As per your order.

00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.639
Tow the plane to the test runway.

00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.759
Colonel, is that really a broom handle?

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.039
Have I ever told you...

00:12:15.039 --> 00:12:16.600
...about my father's hobby?

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:18.600
Woodworking.

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.240
Like Jesus Christ the Savior...

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:22.519
...my father could make a rifle from wood...

00:12:22.519 --> 00:12:24.639
...with more firepower than a machine gun.

00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.720
Trust me.

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:27.600
I know what I'm doing with this thing.

00:12:28.039 --> 00:12:28.639
Yes, sir.

00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:30.320
If my plane...

00:12:30.320 --> 00:12:30.919
...runs into Hitler's plane...

00:12:30.919 --> 00:12:32.399
I'll poke it down with that stick.

00:12:33.919 --> 00:12:35.159
Get this one ready for takeoff.

00:12:41.039 --> 00:12:43.519
Seven-Seven-Zero-One, taxi to the runway.

00:12:43.519 --> 00:12:45.720
Seven-Seven-Zero-One is cleared for test flight.

00:12:46.799 --> 00:12:49.799
Seven-Seven-Zero-Two, taxi to the runway.

00:12:49.799 --> 00:12:50.799
Roger.

00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:57.159
Seven-Seven-Zero-One, two-hundred-fifty-meter runway test.

00:12:57.159 --> 00:12:58.159
Roger.

00:13:28.840 --> 00:13:29.000
Colonel...

00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.080
Is it still because the plane's too heavy?

00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.039
No problem. Try it again.

00:13:32.759 --> 00:13:37.559
Seven-Seven-Zero-Two, two-hundred-fifty-meter runway test.

00:13:37.559 --> 00:13:38.559
Seven-Seven-Zero-Two, roger.

00:13:39.679 --> 00:13:40.240
Cole.

00:13:41.399 --> 00:13:43.159
Remember what I taught you.

00:13:43.399 --> 00:13:45.320
Keep the flaps down.

00:13:45.399 --> 00:13:47.879
Pull back on the yoke.

00:13:48.039 --> 00:13:50.600
Don't fall back into your old habit.

00:13:51.759 --> 00:13:52.519
Yes, sir.

00:13:55.519 --> 00:13:56.480
Flaps down.

00:14:14.039 --> 00:14:14.879
Full throttle.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:15.960
Throttle.

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:26.840
Ready.

00:14:42.159 --> 00:14:44.960
Come on, baby. Get up!

00:14:52.519 --> 00:14:55.039
We did it!

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.360
That was awesome!

00:15:00.759 --> 00:15:01.759
We did it!

00:15:13.399 --> 00:15:14.600
Seven-Seven-Zero-Two...

00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:16.320
...successful takeoff from two-hundred-fifty-meter runway.

00:15:16.320 --> 00:15:19.480
Congratulations.

00:15:29.159 --> 00:15:30.919
Prep the next one. Get them all ready.

00:15:31.519 --> 00:15:31.840
Sir.

00:15:32.159 --> 00:15:32.519
Sir.

00:15:33.039 --> 00:15:33.440
Sir.

00:15:34.159 --> 00:15:35.960
The guns on the other planes haven't been removed yet.

00:15:36.559 --> 00:15:37.919
Then what are we waiting for?

00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:41.000
You're right.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.840
Boys, you saw what Corporal Cole did.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:48.600
All planes will take off to this standard.

00:15:48.600 --> 00:15:49.440
Get to it.

00:16:21.639 --> 00:16:22.080
Thank you.

00:16:35.799 --> 00:16:37.240
Later today...

00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:39.480
...we'll board the Japanese transport ship, Ame Maru.

00:16:39.559 --> 00:16:41.240
We depart from Shanghai's Huangpu Port.

00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:42.600
It's a day and two nights' voyage.

00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:44.600
We'll arrive around five in the morning...

00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:46.080
...the day after tomorrow, at Sanzao Island's...

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.480
...naval Sixth Air Base.

00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:50.519
Excellent.

00:16:51.159 --> 00:16:52.159
Finally, we can go home.

00:16:53.399 --> 00:16:54.200
Takizawa has already figured out...

00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.440
...the situation on the ship.

00:16:55.559 --> 00:16:57.039
It's mostly Japanese soldiers.

00:16:57.279 --> 00:16:58.240
Only two Chinese.

00:16:58.679 --> 00:17:00.600
One is Commander Fujita's interpreter on the island.

00:17:00.799 --> 00:17:01.720
The other one is you.

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:07.960
By the way...

00:17:08.319 --> 00:17:09.440
...about that book you gave me.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:10.400
I think...

00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:12.079
...I found the part you're interested in.

00:17:12.759 --> 00:17:13.279
Tell me about it.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.400
The author, Homer Lea,

00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:17.279
accurately predicted the Pearl Harbor incident.

00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:18.640
He said

00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:20.359
Japan would launch a surprise attack on the Pacific's

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:21.359
naval base, Pearl Harbor,

00:17:21.559 --> 00:17:23.200
Guam, and the Philippine Islands.

00:17:23.559 --> 00:17:24.160
The route would be

00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:25.319
the northern Pacific route.

00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:28.799
Isn't that the same as Japan's

00:17:28.799 --> 00:17:30.559
route for attacking Pearl Harbor?

00:17:31.359 --> 00:17:33.680
I remember what he wrote in this book:

00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.759
In the early hours of a Sunday,

00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.359
the U.S. Pacific Fleet's

00:17:37.359 --> 00:17:38.400
home base, Pearl Harbor,

00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.000
two hundred nautical miles to the north,

00:17:40.279 --> 00:17:42.680
the eastern horizon begins to lighten.

00:17:43.359 --> 00:17:45.160
A tranquil dawn is about to arrive.

00:17:45.359 --> 00:17:47.240
A massive fleet of warships

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:49.359
sails along the northern Pacific route,

00:17:49.519 --> 00:17:50.759
a path never taken by merchant ships,

00:17:50.759 --> 00:17:51.680
slicing through the calm,

00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.200
gradually turning south towards Pearl Harbor.

00:17:53.799 --> 00:17:55.160
This massive fleet

00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:57.160
is centered around aircraft carriers

00:17:57.519 --> 00:17:59.359
arranged in two columns.

00:17:59.440 --> 00:18:02.200
At the four corners are several fast battleships

00:18:02.200 --> 00:18:03.680
and heavy cruisers.

00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.519
A ring of destroyers forms the outer perimeter.

00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.039
And leading this steel wreath

00:18:09.039 --> 00:18:11.680
are several light cruisers

00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:12.799
and submarines.

00:18:13.279 --> 00:18:15.440
On the deck of each aircraft carrier,

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.160
are lined up warplanes with wings spread

00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:19.880
and engines running.

00:18:20.279 --> 00:18:21.759
Beneath their bellies hang

00:18:22.039 --> 00:18:24.240
either heavy bombs or torpedoes.

00:18:24.519 --> 00:18:26.440
On the lead-gray torpedo casings,

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:27.720
a cold light glints faintly.

00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:31.880
What's wrong?

00:18:32.359 --> 00:18:33.799
You memorized it all after one reading?

00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.440
This remarkable American writer

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.880
accurately foresaw in his book

00:18:43.880 --> 00:18:44.640
the events of a few months ago:

00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:46.160
Japan's surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.

00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.440
And it's exactly the same.

00:18:48.079 --> 00:18:49.079
When was this book published?

00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.519
1925.

00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:52.240
1925.

00:18:54.079 --> 00:18:56.039
At that time, Isoroku Yamamoto

00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:58.400
was a military attaché at the embassy in Washington.

00:18:58.799 --> 00:19:01.440
Fujita was an assistant military attaché at the consulate in New York.

00:19:02.319 --> 00:19:03.279
I think Isoroku Yamamoto

00:19:03.279 --> 00:19:04.519
must have read this book.

00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:05.559
Now I finally understand

00:19:05.559 --> 00:19:07.039
why Fujita has been searching for this book.

00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:08.160
He wants to find

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:09.440
Isoroku Yamamoto's train of thought.

00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.559
These high-ranking officers

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:14.079
aren't interested in mere swordplay and brawling.

00:19:14.880 --> 00:19:16.519
I've been searching for a key

00:19:16.759 --> 00:19:17.799
to unlock their minds.

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:20.200
You helped me find it.

00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:23.359
I've made a huge contribution!

00:19:40.440 --> 00:19:42.160
Pardon the interruption during your meal.

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:42.920
Go ahead.

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:44.920
A telegram arrived from Sanzao Island.

00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:48.039
Early the day after tomorrow,

00:19:48.039 --> 00:19:50.079
a transport plane will fly from Shanghai to Sanzao Island.

00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:51.680
General Yasuo Tanikawa suggests, sir,

00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.039
that you take this plane.

00:19:53.240 --> 00:19:54.319
Your female companion

00:19:54.319 --> 00:19:58.279
can proceed to the island by ship first.

00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:02.160
Faced with this sudden change,

00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.640
Takeki, using the pretext of checking the itinerary,

00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:07.599
rapidly weighs the pros and cons of this development.

00:20:07.599 --> 00:20:08.200
Suddenly,

00:20:08.319 --> 00:20:09.240
he realizes that he

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.920
cannot refuse this arrangement.

00:20:11.160 --> 00:20:13.039
The Japanese military is strictly hierarchical.

00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.799
If a senior officer refused

00:20:14.799 --> 00:20:16.880
a flight of just over two hours,

00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:18.319
and chose for himself and his companion

00:20:18.319 --> 00:20:20.559
to drift at sea for two nights and a day,

00:20:20.759 --> 00:20:22.079
it would quickly arouse

00:20:22.319 --> 00:20:24.319
Major General Yasuo Tanikawa's suspicion.

00:20:24.319 --> 00:20:25.279
Thank the General for me,

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:26.799
and please inform him

00:20:27.079 --> 00:20:28.440
that I will take the plane,

00:20:28.519 --> 00:20:29.680
and my girlfriend will go by ship.

00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:30.519
Understood.

00:20:30.519 --> 00:20:31.000
Thank you.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:32.039
I will take my leave now.

00:20:38.319 --> 00:20:38.960
What is it?

00:20:49.079 --> 00:20:49.559
Hello?

00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:50.920
It's me, Takeki.

00:20:51.920 --> 00:20:53.000
There's been a last-minute change.

00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:54.799
Yasuo Tanikawa's adjutant

00:20:54.799 --> 00:20:55.680
came to see me.

00:20:55.759 --> 00:20:56.599
He said early the day after tomorrow,

00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:58.160
there's a plane flying to Sanzao Island.

00:20:59.359 --> 00:21:00.240
Which means

00:21:00.759 --> 00:21:02.680
Miss Ye will have to go by ship alone.

00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:04.640
The question is, is it safe?

00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:06.279
There shouldn't be any problems.

00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:08.160
But we must make proper arrangements.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.160
Understood.

00:21:16.039 --> 00:21:17.319
I have to go alone, right?

00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:21.200
Takizawa and I will arrange your boarding.

00:21:22.359 --> 00:21:23.279
On the ship,

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.000
it will be all Japanese soldiers.

00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:26.680
Besides the Japanese soldiers,

00:21:27.240 --> 00:21:28.319
there will be some non-combat personnel,

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:30.720
but all are connected to the Sixth Air Base.

00:21:31.559 --> 00:21:32.759
Takizawa and I will arrange it.

00:21:32.960 --> 00:21:33.880
They won't dare touch you.

00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:36.640
Alright.

00:21:40.759 --> 00:21:41.200
Well then,

00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.640
I'd like to go pack.

00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:46.359
I don't want to see my father looking like this.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.039
Alright.

00:21:48.599 --> 00:21:50.039
On the ship, no matter who you meet,

00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.079
do not discuss politics.

00:21:53.759 --> 00:21:54.720
No matter what happens,

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.559
remember to remain silent.

00:21:57.359 --> 00:21:58.880
I'll only arrive on the island five hours after you.

00:22:04.319 --> 00:22:04.839
Also,

00:22:21.359 --> 00:22:22.720
there is a special situation

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.240
I feel I must tell you about.

00:22:26.519 --> 00:22:27.799
If anything unexpected happens

00:22:28.519 --> 00:22:30.000
and you fall into the hands of the Japanese Kempeitai,

00:22:30.799 --> 00:22:32.240
their usual interrogation method

00:22:32.519 --> 00:22:34.720
is to first use a hot-tempered officer.

00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:35.759
He will beat you,

00:22:36.039 --> 00:22:36.480
curse at you,

00:22:36.799 --> 00:22:37.359
and threaten you,

00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:39.440
making you feel extreme fear.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.680
Just at the moment you are on the verge of breaking,

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.759
an officer with a higher rank will appear,

00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.799
but with a much gentler attitude.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.559
He will be very kind to you.

00:22:47.839 --> 00:22:49.160
You will feel grateful to him

00:22:49.559 --> 00:22:50.759
and will involuntarily tell him

00:22:50.759 --> 00:22:51.759
everything you know.

00:22:53.200 --> 00:22:54.079
The more this happens,

00:22:55.279 --> 00:22:56.640
remember, the more you must hold firm.

00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.599
So,

00:23:02.480 --> 00:23:03.480
I might be arrested.

00:23:20.559 --> 00:23:23.039
Understood. Dismissed.

00:23:23.039 --> 00:23:23.200
Yes.

00:23:26.200 --> 00:23:26.880
Let's go. We're heading back.

00:23:28.039 --> 00:23:29.559
There's been absolutely no progress here.

00:23:31.279 --> 00:23:32.559
That can't be.

00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:34.480
Should we search the area again?

00:23:34.559 --> 00:23:35.279
No need.

00:23:35.799 --> 00:23:37.079
All squads, return to base.

00:23:39.160 --> 00:23:39.480
You.

00:23:42.079 --> 00:23:44.519
Go check with the Coastal Defense Unit.

00:23:44.519 --> 00:23:47.079
See if the perimeter search turned up anything.

00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:47.599
Yes, sir.

00:23:48.599 --> 00:23:49.599
First squad, follow me.

00:23:49.720 --> 00:23:50.079
Yes, sir.

00:23:57.759 --> 00:23:58.400
Sasaki.

00:23:59.599 --> 00:24:01.599
Have Tang Bingchen, head of the Maintenance Association,

00:24:01.799 --> 00:24:03.640
come to my office.

00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:04.759
Investigating the underground?

00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.240
About face! Forward march!

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:11.240
This isn't over.

00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:45.720
Juer.

00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:47.839
How did you get in here?

00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:49.519
If the Japanese find you, we're done for.

00:24:49.799 --> 00:24:51.480
Couldn't you have come to my house for whatever this is?

00:24:52.319 --> 00:24:53.160
I won't go to your house.

00:24:53.319 --> 00:24:54.799
I'm afraid I won't be able to control my temper.

00:24:55.079 --> 00:24:55.799
I am me.

00:24:56.519 --> 00:24:57.759
My father is my father.

00:24:59.480 --> 00:25:00.039
Juer.

00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.039
It's not that I'm afraid to go to your house.

00:25:02.039 --> 00:25:03.599
It's just that if I end up arguing with your father,

00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.839
how awkward would that be for you?

00:25:06.319 --> 00:25:07.319
Let's not talk about this anymore.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.400
I came to you for a reason.

00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:10.920
Where does your hospital usually keep the medicine?

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.240
Why are you asking that?

00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:16.200
Well...

00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:18.640
Granny accidentally cut her arm.

00:25:18.680 --> 00:25:19.240
I wanted to get her...

00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:20.079
Granny's hurt?

00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:21.359
Is it serious?

00:25:21.799 --> 00:25:23.200
Should I go check on her after work?

00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:24.240
No, no, no.

00:25:24.319 --> 00:25:24.640
That's not necessary.

00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:25.319
No, it's not serious.

00:25:25.319 --> 00:25:26.000
Not serious.

00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:28.880
I just wanted to find her a couple doses of penicillin.

00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.880
Anyway, don't ask so many questions.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.480
Just tell me where your pharmacy is.

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:35.759
Even if I told you where it is,

00:25:35.759 --> 00:25:36.559
you wouldn't be able to get any.

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:38.599
All that medicine is locked up.

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:42.160
What should I do then?

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:42.920
Alright, here's an idea.

00:25:44.759 --> 00:25:46.480
In the next couple of days, when I go to the comfort station

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.680
for the routine inspection,

00:25:47.680 --> 00:25:48.960
I'll try to get two doses out for you.

00:25:49.599 --> 00:25:50.000
Really?

00:25:50.559 --> 00:25:51.240
That's wonderful.

00:25:52.359 --> 00:25:53.880
But is this dangerous?

00:25:55.039 --> 00:25:56.200
Don't worry, it'll be fine.

00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:58.359
That's good then.

00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:00.200
I should get going now.

00:26:00.480 --> 00:26:01.200
Be careful.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.200
Okay. I'm off.

00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:32.720
Everything's arranged.

00:26:33.400 --> 00:26:34.559
Once we get to the dock,

00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.480
I'll call the captain over for you.

00:26:36.839 --> 00:26:37.880
You two can get acquainted.

00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.160
Rest assured,

00:26:39.799 --> 00:26:40.839
he's quite timid.

00:26:43.279 --> 00:26:44.519
The captain is from Kyushu.

00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:46.039
Once you're there,

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:47.200
I'll instruct him

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:48.200
to look after your safety.

00:26:49.680 --> 00:26:50.640
Give me your pistol first.

00:26:52.559 --> 00:26:53.599
What do you need my pistol for?

00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:54.799
After we arrive at the dock,

00:26:55.079 --> 00:26:56.279
I'll hand it to you in front of everyone,

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.440
placing the gun in your hand.

00:26:57.720 --> 00:26:59.279
So they know you have a weapon for self-defense.

00:27:13.359 --> 00:27:14.240
Can I...

00:27:16.079 --> 00:27:17.960
stop by the department store?

00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:20.319
There's still time.

00:27:22.359 --> 00:27:23.279
What do you need to buy?

00:27:25.759 --> 00:27:27.079
It's not related to the mission.

00:27:28.599 --> 00:27:30.079
I want to buy a pair of glasses for my father.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:32.920
Go ahead.

00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.200
Later, you need to hug me.

00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:48.359
What?

00:27:48.799 --> 00:27:49.200
Colonel.

00:27:51.799 --> 00:27:52.240
Captain.

00:27:52.839 --> 00:27:53.960
This is our Colonel.

00:27:53.960 --> 00:27:54.519
Colonel.

00:28:01.559 --> 00:28:02.599
Take good care of my woman.

00:28:03.359 --> 00:28:04.720
If anything happens to her,

00:28:04.839 --> 00:28:06.440
no matter where you go,

00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.480
I will find you.

00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:09.160
Yes, Colonel.

00:28:10.799 --> 00:28:11.759
Keep this on you.

00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:13.559
If any trouble arises,

00:28:13.640 --> 00:28:14.599
use this to defend yourself.

00:28:33.799 --> 00:28:34.559
Go on.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:05.160
Let's go.

00:29:05.599 --> 00:29:06.920
No lingering goodbyes.

00:29:49.079 --> 00:29:50.720
Is this your cabin?

00:29:54.279 --> 00:29:56.759
The best cabin on this ship.

00:29:58.039 --> 00:30:00.759
This time, Shanghai headquarters strictly ordered me

00:30:00.759 --> 00:30:01.960
to vacate it.

00:30:02.720 --> 00:30:03.720
I thought

00:30:04.400 --> 00:30:06.400
some VIP must have arrived.

00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:07.279
Turns out it's just a

00:30:07.279 --> 00:30:08.680
Chinese woman.

00:30:13.319 --> 00:30:14.559
My name is Fukuda.

00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:18.000
I supply all the food, clothing, and goods

00:30:18.559 --> 00:30:20.400
for everyone at the Sixth Air Base.

00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.720
If you need money on the island, come to me.

00:30:25.319 --> 00:30:27.039
I also run a place on the island

00:30:27.039 --> 00:30:29.440
specifically for women to work.

00:30:30.519 --> 00:30:31.079
Oh, right.

00:30:31.160 --> 00:30:33.440
If you don't have a job, you can also see me.

00:30:35.160 --> 00:30:36.319
I don't need a job.

00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:37.519
And I don't know you.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:38.880
Could you please leave?

00:30:40.119 --> 00:30:40.920
Mr. Fukuda.

00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:43.279
What business do you have with me?

00:30:43.279 --> 00:30:44.519
I'm not looking for you.

00:30:45.039 --> 00:30:45.799
I'm looking for the captain.

00:30:46.279 --> 00:30:47.920
You're all brainless animals.

00:30:51.519 --> 00:30:52.519
Don't pay him any mind.

00:30:52.839 --> 00:30:54.119
This man is called Fukuda.

00:30:54.359 --> 00:30:56.119
He's a very unpleasant Japanese man.

00:30:56.519 --> 00:30:58.000
That place for women he mentioned,

00:30:58.000 --> 00:30:59.240
that provides work,

00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:01.000
is the Imperial Army's comfort station.

00:31:05.079 --> 00:31:06.279
My name is Luo Zhiyong.

00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:07.759
I am the interpreter

00:31:07.759 --> 00:31:09.279
for Commander Fujita of the Sixth Air Base.

00:31:09.680 --> 00:31:10.839
I am a Chinese man.

00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.359
I am Ye Biying.

00:31:16.119 --> 00:31:17.720
If I'm not mistaken,

00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.680
this is the first time a Chinese woman has been on this ship.

00:31:20.799 --> 00:31:21.440
And what's more,

00:31:21.759 --> 00:31:23.079
staying in the best cabin.

00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:24.319
Why?

00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:29.759
Who is that Chinese woman?

00:31:30.359 --> 00:31:32.400
Mr. Fukuda, please understand my position.

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:33.720
I'm also just following orders.

00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:34.759
Following orders?

00:31:35.079 --> 00:31:36.039
Whose orders?

00:31:36.839 --> 00:31:39.640
The best cabin has always been for my use.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:42.599
How could you give it to a Chinese woman?

00:31:42.599 --> 00:31:44.359
She's not an ordinary Chinese woman.

00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:45.599
Not an ordinary woman?

00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:48.319
At best, she's still just a Chinese woman.

00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:51.079
They are all lowly animals.

00:31:51.519 --> 00:31:52.680
They don't deserve any courtesy.

00:31:53.599 --> 00:31:54.559
What is he saying?

00:31:55.119 --> 00:31:56.599
Is it related to what happened earlier?

00:31:58.160 --> 00:31:59.599
Just some nasty talk.

00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:00.799
It's best you don't understand.

00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.640
So as not to soil the ears of a beautiful lady.

00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.279
Stop making a scene here.

00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:06.319
Let me tell you,

00:32:06.559 --> 00:32:07.720
she is the Colonel's woman.

00:32:08.079 --> 00:32:08.920
The Colonel decides which cabin she stays in.

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:09.720
That's the cabin she stays in.

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:10.640
Making a fuss is useless.

00:32:16.440 --> 00:32:17.000
Darn it.

00:32:18.119 --> 00:32:20.039
This cabin you were originally staying in

00:32:20.119 --> 00:32:21.720
belongs to a Colonel officer.

00:32:24.880 --> 00:32:25.640
A friend.

00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:28.599
A friend of the Colonel officer.

00:32:30.079 --> 00:32:31.119
I'm feeling a bit unwell.

00:32:31.319 --> 00:32:32.559
I should go back and rest now.

00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:33.519
Good night.

00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:34.799
So, you're here to...

00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:55.240
I met with Director Shen yesterday.

00:32:55.599 --> 00:32:57.240
He told me the details of the operation.

00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.000
He ordered me to obtain the code,

00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.160
frequency, call sign,

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.559
and the radio beacon, and then

00:33:02.039 --> 00:33:03.200
eliminate my assistant

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.119
and that courier.

00:33:04.119 --> 00:33:05.079
Then come out alone.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.359
Different perspectives in planning

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:10.640
naturally lead to different outcomes.

00:33:12.519 --> 00:33:14.039
They only guarantee my safety.

00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:17.599
They are only guaranteeing *your* safety.

00:33:18.519 --> 00:33:19.960
You will certainly be free.

00:33:20.119 --> 00:33:21.720
Without a special reason,

00:33:21.839 --> 00:33:23.400
the Navy's Sixth Air Base

00:33:23.519 --> 00:33:24.880
would not dare to stop you.

00:33:29.440 --> 00:33:31.240
You want to proceed with the Military Statistics Bureau's plan?

00:33:32.319 --> 00:33:33.359
How could I?

00:33:33.640 --> 00:33:36.200
Of course, we proceed with the teacher's plan.

00:33:37.799 --> 00:33:39.759
If we don't follow the Military Statistics Bureau's plan,

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:41.519
your top priority

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:43.240
is to formulate a new plan.

00:33:43.559 --> 00:33:45.440
The logistical support for the Japanese army in Shanghai,

00:33:45.440 --> 00:33:46.559
and the military postal system...

00:33:46.559 --> 00:33:47.079
Which department

00:33:47.079 --> 00:33:47.519
is in charge?

00:33:48.359 --> 00:33:49.799
That system is very extensive.

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:52.599
I recall the Shanghai Expeditionary Army

00:33:52.599 --> 00:33:54.200
does have a Supply Department.

00:33:54.359 --> 00:33:55.519
It's mainly responsible for

00:33:55.519 --> 00:33:57.799
ammunition, fuel, food,

00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.880
medical supplies, and other logistics.

00:34:01.079 --> 00:34:02.359
They also have a

00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:03.519
military postal system.

00:34:03.559 --> 00:34:04.799
But as for who specifically is in charge,

00:34:04.799 --> 00:34:06.039
I'll have to go back and check.

00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:09.320
If I need to transport an

00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.679
important wounded soldier back to Japan,

00:34:11.199 --> 00:34:11.800
who do I contact?

00:34:13.320 --> 00:34:13.960
The Medical Department.

00:34:15.719 --> 00:34:17.920
They have a patient transport unit.

00:34:18.239 --> 00:34:18.639
Right.

00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:19.679
They are the ones in charge.

00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:22.559
And if I need to trace an important piece of mail?

00:34:22.559 --> 00:34:23.159
Who do I see?

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:24.320
The military postal system.

00:34:25.039 --> 00:34:25.920
If you need to,

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:27.199
I can take you there anytime.

00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:29.840
We act tomorrow.

00:35:48.119 --> 00:35:51.119
At this moment, his greatest confusion

00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:52.840
lies with this American.

00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.639
What mission exactly did he

00:35:54.639 --> 00:35:55.719
come to China with?

00:35:57.679 --> 00:35:59.039
And behind this mission,

00:35:59.039 --> 00:36:02.199
what kind of operational plan was it based on?

00:36:03.320 --> 00:36:04.159
This is the mystery

00:36:04.159 --> 00:36:06.639
he hopes to unravel as soon as possible.

00:36:10.599 --> 00:36:12.239
This was Takeki's final

00:36:12.239 --> 00:36:14.440
review of the action plan after landing on the island.

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:15.760
He was well aware

00:36:16.199 --> 00:36:17.760
that a wounded American

00:36:18.119 --> 00:36:20.719
plus a completely inexperienced female assistant

00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:24.920
meant this mission

00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:27.400
would involve all sorts of surprises and difficulties.

00:36:27.519 --> 00:36:29.920
He had to immediately start arranging his own

00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:32.840
alternative extraction route.

00:36:46.159 --> 00:36:47.840
Make way, make way!

00:36:48.719 --> 00:36:50.079
Make way!

00:36:52.920 --> 00:36:54.280
Comin' through!

00:36:57.719 --> 00:37:13.639
Newspapers! Get your newspapers!

00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:19.760
Excuse me.

00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:20.760
It's alright.

00:37:21.039 --> 00:37:22.199
There's still someone!

00:37:22.199 --> 00:37:23.199
Don't drive!

00:37:31.159 --> 00:37:32.519
Stay away from me!

00:37:36.519 --> 00:37:37.559
Get away!

00:37:57.719 --> 00:37:58.559
Sir, please.

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:52.039
Who's in charge here?

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:53.320
I am.

00:38:53.679 --> 00:38:55.159
I'm the captain here.

00:38:56.559 --> 00:38:57.880
Garrison Intelligence Section.

00:38:57.880 --> 00:38:58.800
Hello.

00:38:58.800 --> 00:38:59.880
Is there a place we can talk?

00:38:59.880 --> 00:39:00.519
Yes.

00:39:01.679 --> 00:39:02.119
This way.

00:39:14.159 --> 00:39:15.719
I need to locate a senior officer.

00:39:15.719 --> 00:39:17.360
A letter mailed seven days ago.

00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:18.199
Can you find it?

00:39:19.119 --> 00:39:21.360
I'm afraid it's already in Tokyo.

00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:22.679
That fast?

00:39:23.119 --> 00:39:24.679
Who's responsible for mail security checks?

00:39:25.079 --> 00:39:26.280
Regarding security checks,

00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:27.440
they are handled by the intelligence sections

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.719
of each division and brigade.

00:39:28.719 --> 00:39:30.679
We only handle transport and delivery here.

00:39:31.800 --> 00:39:33.440
After mail arrives here,

00:39:33.440 --> 00:39:35.159
how often is it shipped back to the homeland?

00:39:35.599 --> 00:39:37.159
On average, every fifteen days

00:39:37.159 --> 00:39:38.199
a postal aircraft

00:39:38.199 --> 00:39:39.039
transports it back.

00:39:39.599 --> 00:39:40.880
Once every fifteen days.

00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:42.559
I'm looking for a letter from seven days ago.

00:39:42.559 --> 00:39:43.440
Why can't it be found?

00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:44.719
Because besides

00:39:44.719 --> 00:39:46.719
our postal planes,

00:39:47.079 --> 00:39:48.320
the Nanjing Headquarters,

00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:50.360
the Sixth Air Base,

00:39:50.719 --> 00:39:52.719
and even Hainan Headquarters' postal planes

00:39:52.719 --> 00:39:54.920
also pick up some mail from here.

00:39:55.360 --> 00:39:56.639
The various air bases...

00:39:56.639 --> 00:39:57.840
Their postal aircraft...

00:39:57.840 --> 00:39:59.440
Their precise arrival and departure times here...

00:39:59.440 --> 00:40:00.000
Do you have a schedule?

00:40:00.320 --> 00:40:00.639
Yes.

00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:01.280
Bring it.

00:40:14.159 --> 00:40:15.519
I'm taking a copy. Any problem?

00:40:16.039 --> 00:40:16.639
Fine.

00:40:24.679 --> 00:40:26.719
Such a fierce Special Higher Police officer.

00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:28.800
The Sixth Air Base...

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:30.360
Postal aircraft schedule is now clear.

00:40:30.719 --> 00:40:32.079
Next, we need to get this

00:40:32.079 --> 00:40:34.039
injured American pilot out.

00:40:42.039 --> 00:40:42.800
Put your cap on.

00:40:47.719 --> 00:40:48.760
This is

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:50.920
Investigator Colonel Takeki Ichiro.

00:40:51.599 --> 00:40:52.360
Yes, sir.

00:40:52.639 --> 00:40:53.360
Colonel, sir.

00:40:53.719 --> 00:40:54.599
Your orders, please.

00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:55.760
At your service.

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:58.119
I have a very important patient.

00:40:58.400 --> 00:40:59.559
A senior officer.

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:01.159
I need him sent back to the homeland.

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:01.719
Understood.

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.840
I'll process his paperwork immediately.

00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:05.440
He's currently at a frontline hospital.

00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:06.880
Conditions there are very poor.

00:41:06.880 --> 00:41:08.079
I need to transfer him first

00:41:08.079 --> 00:41:10.039
here for treatment,

00:41:10.039 --> 00:41:11.840
then you repatriate him.

00:41:12.119 --> 00:41:13.679
Which field hospital is he at?

00:41:13.679 --> 00:41:15.320
I'll file the transfer paperwork.

00:41:15.320 --> 00:41:16.440
You don't need to know that.

00:41:17.719 --> 00:41:19.519
Give me a patient transfer form.

00:41:19.519 --> 00:41:20.039
Right away.

00:41:31.599 --> 00:41:32.840
I need your signature and seal

00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:34.360
approving this patient's admission.

00:41:34.519 --> 00:41:35.639
Nagahide Tsuruta.

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:38.599
Colonel, sir.

00:41:38.599 --> 00:41:39.880
I need to see your

00:41:45.559 --> 00:41:47.440
Imperial Household Agency Investigation Section

00:41:52.719 --> 00:41:54.719
I'm Takizawa from Headquarters Intelligence.

00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:55.880
The Colonel's orders

00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.320
must be followed unconditionally.

00:41:57.960 --> 00:41:58.880
As for the hospital,

00:41:59.400 --> 00:42:00.639
I'll go and inform them.

00:42:01.599 --> 00:42:02.119
Yes, sir.

00:42:03.960 --> 00:42:05.599
The messenger jumped from

00:42:05.599 --> 00:42:06.639
a downed aircraft.

00:42:06.639 --> 00:42:07.840
Probably not in one piece.

00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.320
Most likely a severe casualty.

00:42:10.079 --> 00:42:10.880
A woman.

00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:11.960
A severe casualty.

00:42:12.559 --> 00:42:13.760
You've got your hands full.

00:42:16.079 --> 00:42:16.800
So then,

00:42:17.880 --> 00:42:20.400
following the Shanghai underground's directive,

00:42:20.440 --> 00:42:22.840
Takeki and Takizawa cleverly

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:26.320
arranged a third evacuation route.
