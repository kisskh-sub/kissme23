I've been pushing to speed up construction

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:23.030
Xiong Chao,

00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.940
the one nicknamed "Guazi," just confessed.

00:30:26.640 --> 00:30:28.200
From the Xu Li case years ago

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:30.030
to the series of cases

00:30:30.030 --> 00:30:32.070
involving him in recent years,

00:30:33.300 --> 00:30:35.700
he confessed to everything in full detail.

00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.610
All these years,

00:30:39.440 --> 00:30:40.970
you two have worked so hard.

00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:47.840
I remember when Xiaoyue first arrived,

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:51.410
12 years ago.

00:30:52.670 --> 00:30:53.510
He was young,

00:30:54.670 --> 00:30:55.670
idealistic,

00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:57.360
and energetic.

00:30:58.350 --> 00:30:59.480
Watching him

00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:02.660
working like a young bull every day,

00:31:03.710 --> 00:31:05.190
I was so happy.

00:31:07.340 --> 00:31:08.770
Though he made mistakes,

00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:10.710
I didn't think it mattered.

00:31:12.310 --> 00:31:13.460
For young people,

00:31:14.410 --> 00:31:16.740
hitting a few walls
might be good for them.

00:31:19.130 --> 00:31:20.330
But I never expected

00:31:23.310 --> 00:31:25.310
that I'd be the one hitting the wall.

00:31:28.680 --> 00:31:30.680
Someone has to hit that wall,

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:33.310
whether it's you or him.

00:31:35.210 --> 00:31:36.200
I just never expected

00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:38.460
that one hit would last for so many years.

00:31:40.110 --> 00:31:42.510
They've kept me working until retirement.

00:31:42.960 --> 00:31:43.830

00:31:47.140 --> 00:31:48.660
I have no regrets.

00:31:49.010 --> 00:31:50.670
Don't talk like that anymore.

00:31:52.350 --> 00:31:54.880
With your health,
you'll live to be a hundred.

00:32:01.350 --> 00:32:04.010
I've been dreaming
about Xiaoyue again lately.

00:32:04.950 --> 00:32:06.010

Tell them

00:32:14.500 --> 00:32:15.560

00:32:18.270 --> 00:32:19.880
Let's go see them together.

00:32:23.050 --> 00:32:23.730

00:32:25.560 --> 00:32:27.200

00:32:27.630 --> 00:32:29.140
this time as well.

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:30.390
Right?

00:32:30.410 --> 00:32:31.160
Of course.

00:32:32.130 --> 00:32:33.520
I want to see if we can get

00:32:34.190 --> 00:32:35.450
some leniency for her.

00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:38.200
I promise you.

00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.400
