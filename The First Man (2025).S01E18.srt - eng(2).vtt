WEBVTT

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:05.040
I'll bring the car around.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:08.380
(Episode 18)

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.630
Seo Rin.

00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:29.800
Wait, you...

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.950
What in the world is she wearing?

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:47.320
Ma Seo Rin!

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:53.120
Wait a second.

00:00:54.860 --> 00:00:57.530
Is that not Seo Rin?

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:00.230
Then who is she?

00:01:00.970 --> 00:01:02.970
Who is she,
and why does she look just like Seo Rin?

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.280
Which baby should I take?

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:36.940
This can't be happening!

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:39.870
The twin was alive this whole time?

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.520
No, it must just be a look-alike.

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:56.520
Yes, that's it. Just a look-alike.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.060
There are so many look-alikes
in the world.

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.570
I was told she was definitely dead.

00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:24.220
If she's...

00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.050
Jung Suk Hee's daughter...

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:28.290
The side dish shop?

00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.820
No, I have to be sure.

00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.230
I have to find out.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:38.030
No...

00:02:38.730 --> 00:02:40.800
No! Wait...

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:46.170
Taxi!

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:52.840
- CEO Chae.
- Unlock the door. Quick!

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:56.850
Follow that bicycle, now!

00:02:57.950 --> 00:03:00.220
- What's going on?
- I said follow it! Hurry!

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.720
Please, let me be wrong.

00:03:05.090 --> 00:03:07.160
Don't let her be Suk Hee's daughter.
Please.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.140
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:30.380
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.600
It can't be.
The twin was alive. She's alive!

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:52.600
How is this possible?

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.010
What am I going to do?
What am I supposed to do now?

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.480
I got to see
the one and only Chef Kang Jun Ho.

00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:04.850
I really hit the jackpot today!

00:04:06.880 --> 00:04:09.150
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:11.020
Mom!

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.620
Did you just hear that?

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.090
She called her "Mom."

00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.530
She called Jung Suk Hee "Mom!"

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.400
But...

00:04:21.470 --> 00:04:22.700
she definitely died.

00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:25.440
What in the world happened?

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.040
I finally saw Chef Kang Jun Ho!

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:29.840
What?

00:04:30.270 --> 00:04:32.180
Where did everyone go?
Why is the shop empty?

00:04:36.410 --> 00:04:37.520
Welcome.

00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:51.300
Come again. Thank you.

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:53.460
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.070
Gosh...

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.230
What do you mean, "what happened?"

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.340
That girl is standing right there,
alive and well.

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.640
I'm telling you,
Jung Suk Hee's child is alive.

00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:05.510
You told me that child was dead!

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.950
So how is Jung Suk Hee's twin still alive?

00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:13.690
Answer me. I'm asking you what happened.
Lee Kang Hyuk!

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.550
How did you deal with
what I told you to do?

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:17.790
Say something! I said, say something!

00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:20.590
Tell me what you're going to do now!

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:33.970
Bo Ra has gotten so big, hasn't she?

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:36.970
Oh my, our Bo Ra's become a little lady.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:41.410
Bo Ra's not a young lady. She's a kid.

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.950
Mom, you haven't changed a bit.

00:05:45.250 --> 00:05:47.450
Bo Ra, you remember your uncle, right?

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.490
- We video-chatted before.
- Yes, I remember.

00:05:50.590 --> 00:05:55.190
- She loves his songs. Right, sweetie?
- Yes.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:58.930
What about you? Did you two come alone?
Your husband isn't with you?

00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:02.530
This jelly is yummy.

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.600
Here, Bo Ra. Have some.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.440
Thank you.

00:06:06.540 --> 00:06:09.910
Bo Ra, go eat jelly with Grandma
in the room, okay?

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:11.910
- Let's go, Grandma.
- Okay.

00:06:12.480 --> 00:06:14.610
- What a pretty girl.
- Let's go.

00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:20.950
You have some too, Grandma.

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:29.030
You're such a good girl, Bo Ra.
You're so pretty, Bo Ra.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.460
You're nice too, Grandma.
You're pretty too.

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.700
Tae Sook, you weren't kicked out
by your husband, were you?

00:06:39.240 --> 00:06:41.440
Hey! Don't say things like that.
It's bad luck.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.980
Gosh! Dad, you said I'm a singer now.
Are you still going to hit me?

00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:47.410
- You little brat...
- Why is no one in the shop?

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:49.810
Tae Sook!

00:06:50.210 --> 00:06:53.250
- Jang Mi.
- Hey! When did you get here?

00:06:53.450 --> 00:06:56.950
You're too pretty to be wasting away
in a place like this.

00:06:57.090 --> 00:06:59.320
Dad, we've got to marry her off.

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:02.960
Gosh, why the marriage talk already?
It's not like I can do it alone.

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.660
It's about time our Jang Mi got married.

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.970
So, what brings you here?
Did you come with your husband?

00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:10.670
No, I just popped in with Bo Ra.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:14.370
I wanted to show Bo Ra
that she has family here.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.870
Bo Ra's here too? Where is she?

00:07:17.110 --> 00:07:19.080
Bo Ra!

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.780
There's my Bo Ra!

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:27.120
You're even prettier in person
than on our video calls.

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:29.820
- Auntie.
- Oh my.

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.490
You’re too soft.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:34.990
Tae Sook stole your tuition money
to get married,

00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:36.460
and you're this happy to see her.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.770
Hey, you're not still holding a grudge
about me stealing your money, are you?

00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.440
Not when it gave me
such an adorable niece.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:56.850
Did you find anything out?

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.850
I'm asking you what happened!

00:08:03.020 --> 00:08:04.060
It looks like...

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:07.890
Jung Suk Hee hid
one of the twins at the villa.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:11.160
What do you mean, "it looks like?"

00:08:12.230 --> 00:08:13.660
And you're only finding this out now?

00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:15.670
How does that make any sense?

00:08:19.070 --> 00:08:20.070
My baby.

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:22.540
Live.

00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.040
We...

00:08:25.880 --> 00:08:27.350
have to survive and see each other again.

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:53.300
You're here, boss.

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:54.370
You're here, boss.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:02.980
So you're saying Jung Suk Hee
hid one twin at the villa,

00:09:03.580 --> 00:09:05.150
held the other one in front of you,

00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:07.390
and she just pretended
to jump into the river? Is that it?

00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:10.150
She fooled me.

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:12.320
Open up!

00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:14.430
Open up!

00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:22.170
Darn it!

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:39.380
- Darn it!
- What are you doing? Go after her!

00:09:51.230 --> 00:09:52.230
My baby.

00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:55.030
Mommy's so sorry.

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.600
Why don't you just give up, Jung Suk Hee?

00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.950
So what are you going to do now?

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.950
Jung Suk Hee, who we thought was dead,
is alive.

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:20.160
Her twin, a lookalike of Seo Rin,
is alive.

00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:22.130
So what are you going to do now?

00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.600
Hwa Young, I'm sorry.

00:10:25.660 --> 00:10:26.660
I'm so sorry, Hwa Young.

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:27.930
Shut up.

00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:30.370
You think "sorry"
is going to fix any of this?

00:10:36.810 --> 00:10:37.810
Here you go.

00:10:40.110 --> 00:10:42.750
So you know, I'm only putting up with this
because I'm in a good mood today.

00:10:43.810 --> 00:10:44.980
Putting up with what?

00:10:45.780 --> 00:10:49.050
With you constantly ordering from here
and making me run all over the place.

00:10:49.950 --> 00:10:51.990
Should I just stop ordering from you then?

00:10:52.660 --> 00:10:53.860
You think I can't see what you're doing?

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.860
You're just ordering this on purpose
to see me.

00:10:57.830 --> 00:10:58.900
That's not true.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:01.900
Anyway, you haven't eaten dinner yet,
have you, Jang Mi?

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:04.570
Everyone else has gone home,
so let's just eat together.

00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:07.770
If you're asking,
you think I'm going to say no?

00:11:09.310 --> 00:11:11.010
So is that why you ordered two?

00:11:11.440 --> 00:11:13.610
Yes. One for me and one for you.

00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:17.920
- Gosh, don't go to this trouble again.
- Okay.

00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:22.520
So, what's got you in such a good mood?

00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:27.390
My sister Tae Sook and my niece
just came from Vietnam today.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:33.300
And I got to see Chef Kang Jun Ho today,
whom I'm a huge fan of.

00:11:34.830 --> 00:11:35.900
Chef Kang Jun Ho?

00:11:36.300 --> 00:11:37.370
Yes.

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:39.600
Even the way he walked was so cool.

00:11:40.470 --> 00:11:42.570
He was just like a model.

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:46.380
Wait, you mean Chef Kang Jun Ho
from Chang Restaurant...

00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:48.580
is the guy you have a crush on?

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:49.850
Yes.

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.150
So don't even think about hitting on me.

00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:56.090
Because I'm not
the least bit interested in you.

00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.200
Of all people, she has to be hanging
around this hotel.

00:12:08.070 --> 00:12:10.030
If Father or Seo Rin were to see her...

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.040
It would be a nightmare.

00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:18.340
It's a matter of time before they learn
I stole a baby 30 years ago.

00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.280
Calm down. I'll handle it.

00:12:22.010 --> 00:12:23.980
The loose ends from 30 years ago.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.850
- I'll take care of it for good.
- And how are you going to do that?

00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:28.920
You failed 30 years ago.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.160
Why do you think you can handle it now?

00:12:32.660 --> 00:12:34.020
I absolutely will not fail this time.

00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.840
Mrs. Yeom,
you don't have to prepare a thing.

00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:54.680
But still, Chairman.
I should at least prepare our bedding.

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:58.120
The bedding for us to share.

00:12:59.250 --> 00:13:00.950
I know what you're thinking,

00:13:02.090 --> 00:13:03.820
but I can't sleep with someone next to me.

00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:08.090
What?
You mean we'll sleep in separate rooms?

00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:11.860
No, we'll put another bed in the room,
so don't worry about it.

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:15.070
You and Hong Ju just need
to bring your clothes.

00:13:15.330 --> 00:13:16.370
Don't you worry about a thing.

00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:18.670
Okay.

00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:20.400
But...

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:24.680
if CEO Chae finds out I'm moving in here,

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.610
she'll want to kill me.

00:13:27.680 --> 00:13:30.450
- I don't think I'll make it out alive.
- Don't worry.

00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:33.880
You're moving in with me,
not my daughter-in-law.

00:13:34.490 --> 00:13:35.950
What are you so afraid of?

00:13:36.490 --> 00:13:37.890
I'm here for you, so don't you worry.

00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.130
Thank you, Chairman.

00:13:50.730 --> 00:13:53.400
To think of all the years
I spent here with you in tears.

00:13:54.170 --> 00:13:55.170
And all I have to take with me...

00:13:56.270 --> 00:13:57.610
is just this one single bag.

00:13:58.740 --> 00:14:02.580
Well, Yeom San Wol
you've suffered long enough.

00:14:05.250 --> 00:14:06.680
Hey, wait.

00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:08.920
What are you doing with that?

00:14:10.050 --> 00:14:11.060
Mom.

00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:15.060
We're different from the flashy CEO Chae
and arrogant Director Ma.

00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:18.430
- I mean, we have to be.
- What?

00:14:18.500 --> 00:14:19.600
Not this one.

00:14:21.130 --> 00:14:24.500
Like this, we have to look
simple and frugal, you know.

00:14:25.370 --> 00:14:27.910
"We couldn't care less
about your money, Chairman."

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:30.640
"We're not greedy for it at all."

00:14:31.780 --> 00:14:34.750
- That's the vibe we need to give off.
- But...

00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:38.220
do you know how much I had to plead
with him just to get this one bag?

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:41.950
This is fair payment for my labor.
My wages!

00:14:42.020 --> 00:14:43.650
I'm not saying we do this forever.

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:48.230
Ma Seo Rin couldn't run a company
if her life depended on it.

00:14:49.060 --> 00:14:50.930
If I weren't there to clean up her messes,

00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.200
she couldn't even find
the approval documents.

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:55.900
How can he entrust the group
to a girl like that?

00:14:56.470 --> 00:14:57.840
How could he possibly let her inherit it?

00:14:57.900 --> 00:15:01.710
Hong Ju, you really don't know
Chairman Ma at all.

00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:05.610
- That geezer is obsessed with bloodlines.
- You're wrong.

00:15:06.780 --> 00:15:09.010
Even with Ma Seo Rin
so fiercely against it,

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:12.020
we're moving into that house.

00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:14.750
For an old man drowning in loneliness,

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:17.250
what good is a bloodline?

00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:21.130
You've really got it all figured out.

00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:25.360
Mom. Our next objective...

00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.000
is for you to legally marry the Chairman.
All right?

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.770
That's the only way
I can legitimately inherit the company.

00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:35.370
You're right.
That's the least I can do for you.

00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.740
Once you take over Dream Group,
it's like you'll have conquered the world.

00:15:40.810 --> 00:15:44.080
We're no longer the maids
who waited on that mother-daughter pair.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:49.390
So you have to make sure
I get to call him "Dad."

00:15:49.990 --> 00:15:51.060
Got it?

00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:55.530
Right. The humiliation we suffered,
carrying their bags, being patronized.

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:57.530
We will make them pay.

00:16:15.710 --> 00:16:18.380
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:34.130
What am I going to do about that girl?

(Professor Kang)

(Professor Kang)

00:17:17.840 --> 00:17:19.010
Is she busy?

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:23.510
Hwa Young must still be working.

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.750
Hwa Young, are you busy?

00:17:30.450 --> 00:17:32.660
I just called to hear your voice.

00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.290
Don't work too late.
Get some sleep. Good night.

00:17:41.130 --> 00:17:42.370
You scared me!

00:17:44.000 --> 00:17:47.200
What are you so jumpy about?
You're acting strange.

00:17:48.910 --> 00:17:50.440
What's so strange?

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:53.380
Honestly.

00:17:53.710 --> 00:17:56.110
Why are you always taking your phone
to the bathroom?

00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:59.380
You're glued to your phone these days.

00:17:59.950 --> 00:18:03.520
And you're the one
who was always losing it.

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:05.160
Tell me. What's gotten into you?

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:08.560
What are you talking about?

00:18:09.230 --> 00:18:13.230
There's a lot of fun stuff on YouTube,
you know.

00:18:14.630 --> 00:18:18.300
That's true. People leave YouTube on
when they go to sleep these days.

00:18:18.840 --> 00:18:20.470
They say it helps them sleep better.

00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:24.780
Right, you know, those deep sleep videos
or whatever they're called.

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:25.840
Goodness.

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:27.580
Seriously...

00:18:55.140 --> 00:18:57.570
You look like you didn't get any sleep
last night either.

00:18:57.670 --> 00:18:59.440
What about the Chairman? Did he leave?

00:18:59.710 --> 00:19:02.550
Yes. He didn't say where he was going.

00:19:02.610 --> 00:19:04.380
He just said that he had to step out
for something.

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:16.660
Secretary Kim, it's me.

00:19:17.290 --> 00:19:18.460
Where's the Chairman?

00:19:20.730 --> 00:19:22.900
What? You can't tell me?

00:19:23.870 --> 00:19:26.170
Did the Chairman order you
not to tell me anything?

00:19:30.070 --> 00:19:31.980
He went to Yeom San Wol's place,
didn't he?

00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.010
It's not like he can hide it from me,

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:36.910
and you of all people
should know that, Secretary Kim.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:38.920
Listen up.

00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:41.620
You'd better choose your side wisely.

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:48.960
So he thinks he can just openly visit
Yeom San Wol's house?

00:19:58.240 --> 00:19:59.570
Wait here. I'll go get ready.

00:20:08.750 --> 00:20:10.180
(Professor Kang)

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.190
Hwa Young, are you still busy?

00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:23.990
The weather's so nice.
How about a little picnic for lunch?

00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.460
I'll be waiting for you
at Luota Cafe at noon.

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.170
(Professor Kang,

(Two items selected)

00:20:46.720 --> 00:20:50.250
I didn't get to do a full grocery run,
but I found the mackerel you like.

00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:51.760
What a relief.

00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:56.230
You always say you hate fishy mackerel,
but look at you, caring for your sister.

00:20:56.390 --> 00:20:59.030
Jang Mi is so soft-hearted
that whenever she sees the fish's eyes,

00:20:59.100 --> 00:21:01.230
she always covers them with a leaf,
saying she feels bad for them.

00:21:01.370 --> 00:21:03.130
Your attitude toward cooking is all wrong.

00:21:03.570 --> 00:21:06.440
You need to see them as ingredients.
You shouldn't feel sorry for them.

00:21:08.310 --> 00:21:11.070
Bo Ra is such a good eater.
She is such a pretty girl.

00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:15.080
Bo Ra, eat up, okay?

00:21:15.610 --> 00:21:16.680
Okay, Auntie.

(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:33.660
And I got to see Chef Kang Jun Ho today,
whom I'm a huge fan of.

00:21:35.230 --> 00:21:38.240
Of all the people for Jang Mi to like,
it had to be my brother.

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:40.770
Even the way he walked was so cool.

00:21:41.640 --> 00:21:43.540
He was just like a model.

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:46.710
You've got to be kidding me.
A model? How ridiculous.

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:53.080
So don't even think about hitting on me.

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:55.890
Because I'm not
the least bit interested in you.

00:21:57.850 --> 00:22:00.320
As if. That's ridiculous.

in the morning?

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:07.500
Let us in on what’s going on.

00:22:09.130 --> 00:22:10.700
It's nothing.

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:24.380
- Jun Ho, sit down. I have a question.
- What is it?

00:22:26.150 --> 00:22:27.550
Hey, about yesterday...

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:31.960
There's this woman with her hair in a bun,
and a loud, shrill voice.

00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:35.490
Every word out of her mouth is sharp,
but she's got a pretty face.

00:22:37.330 --> 00:22:39.660
- What am I talking about?
- What's with you?

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:41.900
Anyway, did you meet her?

00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:45.040
- You know who I mean?
- What are you talking about?

00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:49.640
- What woman?
- The one who's oblivious she's pretty...

00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:52.480
and is just so prickly all the time.
Do you know her?

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:53.940
Her name is Oh Jang Mi.

00:22:54.680 --> 00:22:55.880
Never heard of her.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:58.750
Besides, where would I find
the time for that?

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:02.220
I'm slammed trying to boost sales
for my showdown with CEO Chae.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.590
It's already been almost two months.

00:23:05.590 --> 00:23:07.790
So you haven't seen her then, right?

00:23:08.130 --> 00:23:11.530
- You don't know her at all?
- Hey, what woman?

00:23:13.700 --> 00:23:15.200
If you're just going to talk nonsense,
I'm out of here.

00:23:21.370 --> 00:23:22.440
Wait, what?

00:23:22.940 --> 00:23:25.210
It seems like he has no idea
who Jang Mi is,

00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:28.380
but then why was she getting her hopes up
over nothing?

What are you going to do?

00:23:46.730 --> 00:23:47.960
I have to face it head-on.

00:23:48.600 --> 00:23:51.600
Just sitting here staring at her
isn't going to solve anything.

It's been about three or four years?

Oh my goodness, you're here!

- She's one of our regulars.
- Really? Please, pick out what you need.

Get out of there now.

- Hey, boss lady. Is everything okay?
- Yes.

What?

Oh my, Oh Tae Pyung.

Dad, this is the CEO who's sponsoring me.

She's the one who helped me
get my recent gig.

00:25:56.130 --> 00:26:00.200
So you're the generous CEO
he's been talking about.

Oh my, I'm so sorry
I didn't recognize you.

Thank you so much.

as a thank-you for helping my brother.

00:26:12.280 --> 00:26:13.280
Lunch boxes?

00:26:17.180 --> 00:26:20.350
And you even come all the way
to our humble shop so often.

00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:23.550
Not at all. Your side dishes here
are really delicious.

00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:26.860
- I find myself craving them sometimes.
- Well, thank you for everything.

00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:28.530
I'm in a hurry, so I should get going.

00:26:29.890 --> 00:26:32.200
I'll come by your office
to thank you properly, CEO Chae.

00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:37.570
She's so classy and beautiful.

00:26:37.570 --> 00:26:40.770
I always thought she seemed too glamorous
to be shopping here.

00:26:40.770 --> 00:26:42.010
She really stood out.

00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:46.580
I saw her there on your performance day
and wondered why,

00:26:46.710 --> 00:26:48.410
and it turns out
she was the CEO sponsoring you all along.

00:26:49.780 --> 00:26:53.180
- Oh my, she forgot her food.
- Hey, hurry and bring it to her.

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.420
- Oh no.
- Hurry up.

00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.890
- What do you want me to do?
- Just drive.

00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:07.930
Ma'am, you forgot this.

00:27:19.010 --> 00:27:20.180
That's strange.

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:21.980
What is it, Dad?

00:27:22.750 --> 00:27:23.980
About the banner.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:26.750
If I remember correctly,
she also filed a complaint...

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:28.420
to have a banner taken down.

00:27:29.420 --> 00:27:32.020
What? CEO Chae Hwa Young did?

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:52.310
(The First Man)

00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:56.310
- Do you really like Chef Kang Jun Ho?
- How is that your business, Lawyer Kang?

00:27:56.380 --> 00:27:59.980
Stop right now. He's a workaholic
who's always incredibly busy.

00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:03.350
What is the meaning of this, Father?
In my house, of all places,

00:28:03.490 --> 00:28:05.460
you're letting Yeom San Wol
and her daughter move in?

00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:08.090
This isn't your house. It's my house.

00:28:08.390 --> 00:28:10.230
After everything I've been through
to get here...

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:12.400
You think I'm going to bat an eye?

00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.700
I should go to the hotel
to introduce myself.

00:28:15.100 --> 00:28:16.170
Oh Jang Mi?

00:28:16.530 --> 00:28:17.570
I can't let this happen.

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:19.570
If the Chairman or Seo Rin sees her...

00:28:20.570 --> 00:28:22.570
