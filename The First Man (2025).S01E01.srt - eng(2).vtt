00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:30.440
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.540
- Aren't you cold?
- It is a little cold.

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.150
See? Come on, get out of there.

00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:03.870
Suk Hee.

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.070
You're so beautiful.

00:01:29.090 --> 00:01:30.360
The chairman is looking for you.

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:31.860
Tell him I'm not coming.

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.870
You should go, Dong Seok.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:40.370
It's only natural that your father
disapproves of me.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.950
What's so natural about it?

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.950
The woman I love...

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:51.950
is you, Jung Suk Hee.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.620
He's not the one getting married, I am.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:01:57.160
But still.

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:00.160
From your father's point of view,

00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.160
I'm an orphan with nothing to my name.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.500
Why would he want me
for a daughter-in-law?

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.670
I'm marrying you, no matter what.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.950
- Congratulations!
- Over here!

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:40.590
What's with Dong Seok?
Is he coming or not?

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.330
Well, sir...

00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:48.870
Father, I'm home.

00:03:49.730 --> 00:03:52.700
What on earth is wrong with you?

00:03:52.970 --> 00:03:56.110
How have you been conducting yourself
to get mixed up with all these women?

00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.410
And now that showgirl, Chae Hwa Young,
claims she's pregnant with your child?

00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:01.880
What? With my child?

00:04:02.550 --> 00:04:03.880
No, that's impossible.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:13.160
As if the orphan, Suk Hee, wasn't enough,
now it's a showgirl?

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:17.030
Don't even think of bringing
those low-class people into my house.

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.270
Father, this has nothing to do with me.

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.530
Chae Hwa Young?

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.370
This claim that she's carrying my child
is completely absurd.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.010
- What?
- For the record,

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:30.640
Suk Hee is very capable and smart.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.010
She even passed the first round
of the bar exam.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:36.710
You keep looking down on her as an orphan,
but what's so wrong with that?

00:04:36.710 --> 00:04:38.080
Aren't orphans human beings?

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:40.080
You brat!

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:44.860
Marriage is a union between two families.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:47.530
Why can't you see the bigger picture?

00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.060
Marital connections
are very important for a businessman.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.830
- Why don't you understand that?
- Suk Hee...

00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:57.670
is more than worthy of being my wife.

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:00.170
As for this Chae Hwa Young scandal,
I'll take care of it.

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.970
This could be considered defamation.

00:05:02.970 --> 00:05:05.680
I swear, nothing inappropriate
ever happened with that woman.

You're eight weeks along.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:19.860
Dong Seok.

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:23.590
We're having a baby.

00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:28.900
It feels so surreal
that I'm going to be a mother.

00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.270
I can hardly believe it.

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.650
Dong Seok will be so thrilled
when he finds out, won't he?

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.680
When I tell him he's going to be a father,

00:05:47.450 --> 00:05:50.460
I wonder what the look
on his face will be.

What is this preposterous article?
Have we ever even dated?

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:12.380
You were the one
chasing after me all this time,

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.250
so how could you plant
a completely fabricated story like this?

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.150
- Did you think I'd even bat an eye?
- Dong Seok.

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:20.790
- Is marrying me such a terrible thing?
- What?

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:25.220
Marriage? Who's getting married?
Snap out of it!

00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:26.890
You're being unbelievably delusional.

00:06:27.190 --> 00:06:28.760
And on top of it all,
you claim you're carrying my child?

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:31.000
I've never so much as held your hand.

00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.200
How could something so outrageous
even be possible?

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:35.970
- What do you mean, "outrageous?"
- Let me be perfectly clear.

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.800
I'm in love with someone else,

You're the model for our department store.
Nothing more, nothing less.

Do I make myself clear?

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.580
So you're planning on marrying
that woman, Jung Suk Hee.

But that's not going to happen.

- One way or another, you will marry me.

Because I'm pregnant with your child.

Please just stop
with that ridiculous nonsense.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.730
Pregnant with my child?

00:07:04.430 --> 00:07:07.870
What are you, Chae Hwa Young?
The Virgin Mary?

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:11.170
I suppose you can just
get pregnant all by yourself.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:15.710
Are you playing dumb?
Or are you pretending you don't remember?

00:07:16.310 --> 00:07:18.580
- What are you talking about?
- After the team dinner,

00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:21.980
I took you home
when you were drunk, remember?

00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:26.150
- And?
- You held me and said Suk Hee's name.

00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:28.850
Don't even try to say
you mistook me for her.

00:07:29.790 --> 00:07:32.890
Mistake or not, what's done is done.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:35.890
And you'd better get this straight.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:38.600
I am not The Virgin Mary.

I'm the woman
who is going to be your wife.

And your child is growing inside of me.

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:47.670
Don't you forget it.

No, that's impossible.

How could Dong Seok...

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:16.570
cheat on me with her?

All this time we've been dating,

00:08:19.370 --> 00:08:21.440

Father. Please let me marry Dong Seok.

00:08:42.690 --> 00:08:46.160
This family doesn't need some showgirl
for a daughter-in-law.

00:08:46.200 --> 00:08:49.970
I love Dong Seok.
And I'm carrying his child!

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.000
A child?

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:57.480
And who's to say it's my son's child
and not some other bum's?

00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:01.750
- Some little tramp...
- Father! How can you say that?

00:09:02.280 --> 00:09:05.020
Who are you calling "Father?"

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.350
I will never accept a showgirl
as my daughter-in-law,

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:10.020
so save your breath and just leave.

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.090
Father, please don't cast me aside.

The reporters all know,
and the rumors are already out.

If you won't accept me,
what am I supposed to do?

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.830
Father, please change your mind.

00:09:24.040 --> 00:09:25.940
Please just accept me.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:27.540
Father!

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:41.090
If you insist on casting me aside,

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.920
it's going to have a major impact
on the department store's image.

00:09:45.660 --> 00:09:47.260
It's already all over the papers
and everywhere else.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.930
Everyone knows
I'm carrying your son's child.

00:09:50.230 --> 00:09:52.330
Go on, then.
Be cruel to me and see what happens.

00:09:53.330 --> 00:09:56.300
When consumers see how heartless you are,

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.270
they will boycott Dream Department Store.

00:10:00.770 --> 00:10:03.210
So before the boycotts start
and your stock price plummets,

00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:05.980
I advise you to think this through.

00:10:07.710 --> 00:10:10.980
I will be waiting for your wise decision.

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:22.190
Dong Seok isn't here?

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:24.160
Where did he go?

Please open the door.

00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.540
This is all a misunderstanding.

00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:36.340
Just listen to me.

00:10:36.340 --> 00:10:37.380
Suk Hee!

00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:41.350
The young lady in the front room
packed her bags and just left.

What?

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:45.820
- What do you mean? Where did she go?
- How should I know?

00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:49.590
Her eyes were all puffy from crying
when she left.

00:10:55.660 --> 00:10:56.660

Sorry.

Little one.

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.420
You don't have a father anymore.

00:11:58.420 --> 00:11:59.820
But that's okay, right?

00:12:01.030 --> 00:12:02.030
Mommy...

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:04.530
will raise you well.

00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:07.000
Little one.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:31.590
Until this scandal with Chae Hwa Young
blows over,

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.520
you're going to our branch in France.

(6 months later)

00:13:03.350 --> 00:13:07.190
Your amniotic fluid is lower than normal,
so we need to monitor you closely.

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:10.690
And you need to get complete bed rest.

00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.860
You especially have to avoid stress.

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:20.240
If you notice anything unusual,
come to the hospital right away.

00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:24.210
I came to the rural hospital out here,
and all they do is nag.

00:13:24.210 --> 00:13:25.240
How annoying.

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:33.580
Hey, stop it. People are watching.
Just start the car.

00:13:34.120 --> 00:13:35.190
But...

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.190
are you really going to have this baby
on your own?

00:13:37.790 --> 00:13:40.320
Why are you asking that now?
Isn't it obvious?

00:13:40.930 --> 00:13:42.430
Where is this coming from all of a sudden?

00:13:45.930 --> 00:13:48.370
We're just receiving this breaking news.

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:50.670
Ma Dong Seok, the vice president
of Dream Department Store,

00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:54.040
has gone missing while yachting
near Monaco.

00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:55.310
According to witnesses,

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:59.580
there were reports of what sounded like
a large explosion near the yacht.

00:13:59.580 --> 00:14:02.680
After hearing the news,
Chairman Ma immediately left for Monaco...

00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:04.220
with his employees.

00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.550
- Sweetheart, what's wrong?
- No.

00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.520
Dong Seok...

00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:13.360
No, this can't be happening to him.

00:14:31.540 --> 00:14:34.750
What's the latest?
Is Chairman Ma back from Monaco?

00:14:35.150 --> 00:14:38.650
- Yes, he just got to his residence.
- That's not what I'm asking!

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.120
What about Dong Seok?
What happened to him?

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:44.660
Did they find him or not?

00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:46.690
Apparently, he's still missing.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:54.130
Don't worry too much.
They haven't found a body yet,

00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:57.470
- so he could still be alive somewhere.
- So much time has gone by already.

00:14:58.240 --> 00:14:59.840
If they haven't found him by now,
he's dead.

00:15:00.370 --> 00:15:02.240
Dong Seok is dead!

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:06.140
He's had more than enough time
to become fish food by now.

00:15:09.810 --> 00:15:12.450
You're happy about this, aren't you?
This is what you wanted, isn't it?

00:15:14.050 --> 00:15:15.490
- Chae Hwa Young.
- What?

00:15:15.750 --> 00:15:18.660
You were praying for this to happen,
weren't you?

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:21.330
You think I don't know you? Dream on.

00:15:22.060 --> 00:15:24.900
Even if something happened to Dong Seok,
I'm never going back to you.

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:27.500
I know.

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.870
You're way too good for me.
I wouldn't dream of it.

00:15:31.970 --> 00:15:34.940
Good. As long as you know your place.

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.270
Still,

00:15:39.710 --> 00:15:41.710
just know that
I'll always be here for you.

00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:46.580
Are you okay?

00:15:46.980 --> 00:15:48.020
Get the car ready.

00:15:48.720 --> 00:15:50.150
Since it's come to this,

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.830
I need to have it out with Chairman Ma.

00:16:02.030 --> 00:16:03.200
There's no need to cry.

00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:05.600
Dong Seok isn't dead.

00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.610
I don't care what anyone says.

00:16:08.870 --> 00:16:11.580
My Dong Seok isn't dead.
I'm sure he's alive out there somewhere.

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:14.480
Yes.

00:16:15.250 --> 00:16:17.080
I hope so too, Father.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:22.750
How far along are you?

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:27.120
I'm eight months along.

00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:31.330
This is your grandson, Father.
And he's Dong Seok's son.

00:16:31.560 --> 00:16:32.700
It's a boy.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:36.000
Everyone says I look like
I'm having a boy.

00:16:36.070 --> 00:16:38.870
And how can you prove
that baby is Dong Seok's?

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:41.110
How could you say such a thing?

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:42.640
That's just cruel.

00:16:43.370 --> 00:16:45.940
I'm not the kind of woman
who sleeps around.

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:48.850
Do you think
all actresses are just bar girls?

00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:50.710
My point is,

00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.920
prove that the child is Dong Seok's.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:56.090
Then...

00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.160
I'll accept you as my daughter-in-law.

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:03.360
This child is Dong Seok's.

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:05.300
Fine.

00:17:05.300 --> 00:17:06.660
After I have this baby,

00:17:07.430 --> 00:17:10.370
I will prove without a doubt
that he is Dong Seok's child.

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.100
And when I do,

00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:15.170
you will apologize
for what you said to me.

00:17:16.340 --> 00:17:17.340
I just...

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.380
feel so incredibly wronged, Father.

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:05.520
Stop the car!

00:18:07.020 --> 00:18:09.630
That woman! That's Jung Suk Hee!

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:13.000
Her belly...

00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:15.100
She's pregnant too?

00:18:25.680 --> 00:18:28.550
Is she carrying Dong Seok's baby?

00:18:28.980 --> 00:18:30.580
(8-25 Namseon-dong, Hangang-gu, Seoul)

00:18:30.910 --> 00:18:32.120
Dong Seok.

00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:35.290
Nothing's really happened to you, has it?

00:18:35.990 --> 00:18:39.320
I intended to raise this child
without you.

00:18:40.220 --> 00:18:42.390
But I can't even bear
the thought of you...

00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.190
no longer being in this world.

00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:46.960
Now that Chairman Ma is back from Monaco,

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:49.000
I'll ask what's happened,

00:18:49.530 --> 00:18:52.640
if they've found you,
or if you're gone forever.

00:18:53.070 --> 00:18:54.710
That's all I'll ask.

00:18:54.870 --> 00:18:55.910
Just that.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:58.440
No way.

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:01.580
I absolutely cannot let Jung Suk Hee
meet with Chairman Ma.

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.550
Dong Seok's child...

00:19:04.010 --> 00:19:05.920
has to be my baby. Mine alone.

00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:15.830
What is this? Why won't it open?
Open the door!

00:19:15.830 --> 00:19:17.790
What do you think you'll accomplish
by running out there?

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:21.970
I have to stop her. I can't let
Jung Suk Hee see Chairman Ma.

00:19:22.030 --> 00:19:24.570
And stopping her now
is going to make that baby just disappear?

00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:25.700
Lee Kang Hyuk!

00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:29.270
Open this door! Open it!

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:32.940
- She already rang the doorbell.
- What?

00:19:35.950 --> 00:19:37.050
Darn it.

00:19:41.890 --> 00:19:44.860
This is your grandson, Father.
And he's Dong Seok's son.

00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:46.260
It's a boy.

00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:48.530
A son, she says...

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.930
A grandson to carry on my legacy.

00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:54.200
Fine.

00:19:54.200 --> 00:19:55.800
After I have this baby,

00:19:56.370 --> 00:19:59.370
I will prove without a doubt
that he is Dong Seok's child.

00:20:02.010 --> 00:20:04.140
Seeing how she's so confident about it,

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:07.110
the baby must be Dong Seok's.

00:20:08.110 --> 00:20:09.550
If that's the case,

00:20:10.410 --> 00:20:11.780
then I'll leave my grandson...

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:15.820
everything I have.

00:20:20.390 --> 00:20:23.730
Hey, Ms. Kim. I heard the chairman's back.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:26.260
Does that mean they've given up
on finding his son?

00:20:26.360 --> 00:20:29.300
Tell me about it.
They haven't even found his body.

00:20:29.870 --> 00:20:32.040
Everyone's saying it's hopeless.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.040
That's terrible.

00:20:34.710 --> 00:20:35.970
What am I going to do?

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:38.780
Dong Seok, what am I going to do?

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.400
I'm in love with someone else,

00:21:05.570 --> 00:21:07.040
and I am going to marry her.

00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.970
In your dreams, Jung Suk Hee.
Just give up and go home.

00:21:11.410 --> 00:21:14.040
You can never meet Chairman Ma.

00:21:14.680 --> 00:21:15.910
My child is more than enough...

00:21:16.250 --> 00:21:18.180
as Dong Seok's child.

00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:22.220
You think I'll let you have that baby
without a fight?

00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:25.190
You are never having that baby.

00:21:28.490 --> 00:21:30.090
Tail her, but be discreet.

00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:35.470
With Dong Seok gone,
you think you can raise his child alone?

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:37.830
Not a chance.

00:21:44.210 --> 00:21:45.210
Oh, gosh.

00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:48.650
Ma'am, I'm so sorry.
I meant to be right back from my break...

00:21:48.650 --> 00:21:51.520
Where have you been?
Are you planning on working today or what?

00:21:51.520 --> 00:21:53.280
I'm sorry. I'll get right to it.

00:21:55.750 --> 00:21:57.590
Excuse me, can we get some more kimchi?

00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.260
- Sure.
- Hurry up.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.760
Here you are.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:20.710
I'm heading out for the day.

00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:24.180
I can't stand Jung Suk Hee.

00:22:24.850 --> 00:22:27.050
How can she be just as pregnant as I am?

00:22:27.320 --> 00:22:29.190
Does that even make sense to you?

00:22:30.020 --> 00:22:32.890
I think you're the one
who's not making any sense.

00:22:33.190 --> 00:22:34.590
What's that supposed to mean?

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:39.630
I have Reserve Forces Training tomorrow,
so I can't come.

00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.000
You can go to the hospital alone, right?

00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:43.270
So your Reserve Forces Training
is more important than I am?

00:22:44.270 --> 00:22:45.370
Good night.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:51.540
Jung Suk Hee.

00:22:52.510 --> 00:22:55.450
How am I going to stop you?

00:23:16.070 --> 00:23:18.640
I have to do something.

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:32.850
That's it. I'll just run her over.

00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:35.350
Then the baby and that woman
will both be...

00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:55.170
- Hey, let's go!
- That was a total slam dunk!

00:23:56.270 --> 00:23:58.580
- Do you want to hit the arcade?
- See you at the entrance.

00:23:58.940 --> 00:24:00.580
My mom said I had to get home.

00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:07.380
Darn it.

00:24:29.810 --> 00:24:31.780
Dong Seok isn't dead.

00:24:32.510 --> 00:24:34.580
They never even found a body.

00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:37.780
That's right.

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:41.050
So, pull yourself together, Jung Suk Hee.

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:43.790
You're a mother now.

00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:46.690
You need to be strong...

00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.590
like a mother should be.

00:24:50.430 --> 00:24:51.630
I can do this.

00:24:58.970 --> 00:25:02.370
Who says you get to be a mother?
That's ridiculous.

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:08.010
What's happening?

00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:39.210
All right, Jung Suk Hee.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:41.340
This is where you live, is it?

00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:45.350
Now that I know where you work
and where you live,

00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:47.120
you just wait.

00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:16.210
No, my baby.

00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:21.440
No.

00:27:22.180 --> 00:27:23.380
No way.

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.390
No.

00:27:30.390 --> 00:27:33.420
No, this can't be happening.

00:27:33.990 --> 00:27:35.030
No.

00:27:47.840 --> 00:27:49.710
Gosh, you startled me.

00:27:51.370 --> 00:27:53.010
Because you're twins,

00:27:53.610 --> 00:27:56.180
are you competing to see
who kicks the hardest?

00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:03.220
All right. Have all the fun you want...

00:28:03.650 --> 00:28:05.490
as long as you're born healthy.

00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.560
Ok Hee.

00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:09.860
Tok Hee.

00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:14.330
I'm going to take such good care of you.

00:28:15.530 --> 00:28:16.530
Okay?

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:29.510
- Prepare for surgery!
- Yes.

00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:30.580
Hurry!

00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:32.750
Please...

00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:36.920
No.

00:28:37.690 --> 00:28:39.360
Nothing can happen to my baby.

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:42.260
Please save my baby.

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:43.660
Please.

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.060
(The First Man)

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:19.500
What do you mean I'm fired?

00:29:19.830 --> 00:29:24.530
"Room and board. Mature women welcome."
This is a godsend!

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:28.540
My goodness.
You must have a big baby in there.

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:31.210
- It's because they're twins.
- Twins?

00:29:31.210 --> 00:29:32.540
The chairman is here.

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:34.740
What are you doing? Open the door!

00:29:35.310 --> 00:29:39.280
- I smell wine.
- Oh, no. What if I get caught?

00:29:43.650 --> 00:29:45.660
