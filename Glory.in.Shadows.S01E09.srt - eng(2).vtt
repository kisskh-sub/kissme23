00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:08.880
Madam.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.120
Madam.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:12.630
Are you alright?

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:13.980
I'm fine.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:14.950
Are you hurt?

00:01:15.430 --> 00:01:16.270
Madam.

00:01:16.640 --> 00:01:17.920
Your sachet is missing.

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:21.630
(Did she)

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.430
(lure me there on purpose today?)

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:25.520
(This is bad.)

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:26.590
(The sachet is missing.)

00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:28.400
(If Qin Ruoyi find it,)

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:29.880
(I'm afraid...)

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.240
Yaochu.

00:01:35.560 --> 00:01:36.400
Don't go in.

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.280
It may not be good for you
to enter right now.

00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:40.400
Let's wait until my brother returns.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:41.760
What's going on?

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.120
Madam.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:52.480
Look who's here.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:03.320
Old Madam.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:04.710
Who is...

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:06.760
You mean her?

00:02:07.150 --> 00:02:07.990
Yes!

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:09.640
That's her!

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:11.960
Who is he?

00:02:12.150 --> 00:02:12.990
Madam.

00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:14.240
This man claims

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.190
you secretly pledged yourself to him,

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.590
and accepted the bride price.

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.470
He came here demanding someone from us.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.400
Yaochu.

00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:24.000
You once said

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.310
we'd love and stay together for life

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.080
and you'd never leave me.

00:02:28.750 --> 00:02:29.590
Why did you...

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:31.750
Why did you just marry into Li Manor

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:33.560
and become another man's wife?

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:43.910
Take one more step forward,

00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.030
and I'll end your life.

00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:51.560
Yaochu, why are you staring at me?

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.150
Yaochu.

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.560
We first met at Guanyin Nunnery.

00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.870
I saved you

00:02:57.240 --> 00:02:58.710
and your hysterical mother.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:00.240
You said

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:01.960
you'd give yourself to me.

00:03:02.470 --> 00:03:03.430
Have you forgotten it?

00:03:03.710 --> 00:03:04.590
Shen.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.430
How do you explain this matter?

00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.960
You claim I took the bride price.

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:09.920
How much was it?

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.150
Was it silver, a banknote,
or a deposit slip?

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:14.310
If it's a deposit slip,

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.080
which bank was it deposited in?

00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:21.520
Well...

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.000
It was one hundred taels in silver.

00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:31.630
That was saved by my parents for me.

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:33.430
You tricked it away.

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:34.840
Now

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:36.150
you still want to deny it?

00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:38.470
So you mean I snuck out

00:03:39.030 --> 00:03:41.360
of the heavily guarded
Prefecture Governor's Manor

00:03:41.630 --> 00:03:43.430
with my hysterical mother

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:44.590
without anyone noticing?

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.080
Then I happened to run into danger
and you saved me?

00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.030
And in that moment,
I still pledged myself to you,

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.800
took this hundred taels in silver,

00:03:51.890 --> 00:03:52.730
and returned

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:54.710
with my mother
to the Prefecture Governor's Manor?

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:56.400
Don't you find this absurd?

00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:03.310
You can deny it.

00:04:06.550 --> 00:04:07.390
But how do you

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:08.240
explain this then?

00:04:09.470 --> 00:04:11.680
This was the token of love you gave me.

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.870
Your name is even embroidered on it.

00:04:17.950 --> 00:04:18.790
This...

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:20.920
Your name really is on it.

00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:23.950
You accepted both the token
and the bride price.

00:04:24.190 --> 00:04:25.030
Madam.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.630
You can't deny it now.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.320
Shen.

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.390
Do you have anything else to say?

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.840
Old Madam.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.870
I lost this sachet just yesterday.

00:04:36.390 --> 00:04:38.000
I never thought
an outsider would find it

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:39.830
and then use it to frame me.

00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.720
You say it was lost yesterday,

00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.120
but do you have proof of that?

00:04:43.630 --> 00:04:44.470
Proof?

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:46.830
You want proof?

00:04:56.310 --> 00:04:57.240
Is this proof

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.520
enough?

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.380
(The Late Madam Sheng Shuran
of the Shen Family)

00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:06.630
Bring it here and let me see.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:12.190
After my mother was laid to rest,

00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:15.120
(The Late Madam Sheng Shuran)
I went to Guanyin Nunnery for a talisman.

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.750
It still bears the date I requested it.

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:19.290
You said

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.430
this is our token of love

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.720
before I was married.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:24.000
Then why would there be

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.270
my mother's talisman inside this?

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:28.430
Could I foresee?

00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.800
Did I know beforehand
of my mother's tragic death?

00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:33.350
This...

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:34.520
This...

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.000
I'll give you a chance.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:48.830
Name the person pulling the strings,

00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:50.870
and I'll spare your life.

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:53.040
Or you can forget about

00:05:53.720 --> 00:05:54.630
walking out of here.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:58.880
It was...

00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.000
It was...

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.560
You dare slander the General's Lady!

00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:04.780
Do you have no regard for your own life

00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:06.120
and even your entire family's life?

00:06:08.070 --> 00:06:09.630
You speak with such threats.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.390
Even if there is someone behind this,

00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:12.510
he wouldn't dare speak up now.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:15.710
Madam.

00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.430
I only feared you might be
wrongly accused,

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:19.600
and misspoke in haste.

00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:22.310
Please don't misunderstand
my intentions.

00:06:23.830 --> 00:06:24.670
Insolent!

00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:26.680
You defamed the Madam of Li Manor.

00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:28.190
Think an apology can settle this?

00:06:29.390 --> 00:06:30.230
Guards!

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:31.630
Hand him over to the authorities

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:32.620
for punishment!

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:33.470
Yes!

00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:34.520
Hold on!

00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.950
This matter is hardly honorable.

00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:39.680
If it's taken to the court,

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.120
it will become common gossip!

00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.630
By then even false claims
will be taken as truth.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.760
Shen.

00:06:50.830 --> 00:06:52.270
As the Madam of Li Manor,

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:54.270
how can you lose something

00:06:54.430 --> 00:06:55.560
you carry close to you

00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.040
and give schemers a chance
to stir trouble here?

00:06:58.190 --> 00:06:59.240
Do you even value

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:01.000
the honor of Li Manor?

00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:03.520
Old Madam.

00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:05.560
As the matriarch of the household,

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:08.120
you should protect the women
in this family.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:09.680
Instead, you find fault with me

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:11.160
in front of unsavory people.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:13.150
What, are those

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:14.950
who spread rumors blameless,

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:16.560
but the victim is being accused?

00:07:17.830 --> 00:07:19.390
That's what disgraces the family name.

00:07:22.510 --> 00:07:24.120
If word of this gets out,

00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:25.560
I wonder

00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:27.310
which woman

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.240
would still agree to marry a Li heir.

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.640
Insolent!

00:07:30.810 --> 00:07:31.680
Zhao Bu.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:32.620
Yes.

00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:33.800
Throw him out.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:35.680
Even if not sent to authorities,

00:07:36.800 --> 00:07:38.040
make sure he learns his lesson.

00:07:38.950 --> 00:07:39.790
Take him away.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:42.430
Find out who's pulling the strings
behind him.

00:07:43.040 --> 00:07:44.270
If he refuses to speak,

00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:48.000
break his legs.

00:07:48.480 --> 00:07:49.320
Yes, Madam.

00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.120
- Spare me!
- Get up!

00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:52.190
Madam, please have mercy.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:53.040
Move!

00:07:53.070 --> 00:07:54.240
Madam, please spare me!

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:55.200
Madam!

00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:57.360
Madam, have mercy!

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.160
Sir, let me go.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.480
Let me go. Gently.

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.920
Spare me, I beg you.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.750
Don't hit me, please.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:11.720
- Don't hit me!
- Stop!

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:14.840
- Madam.
- Madam.

00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.160
Madam, please spare me!

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.560
Let him go.

00:08:20.870 --> 00:08:21.710
Rest assured.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.240
If anyone asks,

00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:25.430
say his legs are broken.

00:08:29.270 --> 00:08:30.110
Stand down.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:31.150
- Yes.
- Yes.

00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:32.520
Let's go.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.680
Madam.

00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:38.680
Madam.

00:08:38.910 --> 00:08:40.120
Madam, have mercy.

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:42.480
Why is Shen Yaochu so hard to deal with?

00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:44.390
She slipped away last night.

00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:46.790
And now
she's dodged trouble again today!

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:48.440
Please calm yourself.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:50.320
The account records are retrieved.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:52.060
Madam won't be able to
stir up anything.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:53.390
You still hold the advantage.

00:08:56.220 --> 00:09:01.260
(Yongle, one thousand taels)

00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.120
(If that timid one rat me out...)

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:11.750
(Even if he does,)

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:13.080
(there's no proof anyway.)

00:09:13.870 --> 00:09:16.030
(The Old Madam will stand by me.)

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.320
You're a clerk from Yongle Bank?

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:20.680
I...

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.270
You and Concubine Qin

00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:24.480
knew each other long ago?

00:09:25.600 --> 00:09:26.440
No.

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:27.840
Never met before.

00:09:28.120 --> 00:09:30.320
Do you know that framing
a family of a court official

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:31.910
is a grave offense?

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.240
Didn't Mr. Liu tell you?

00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.750
No, no, he didn't say anything.

00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:38.480
Please save me, Madam.

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.200
I'm begging you to save me.

00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:42.490
Yes.

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:44.960
Mr. Liu forced me.

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.000
Speak clearly.

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:52.750
Shopkeeper Liu

00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:55.080
and Concubine Qin...

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:00.670
I can protect you.

00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:02.440
But you must do me a favor.

00:10:03.270 --> 00:10:04.110
Madam.

00:10:04.510 --> 00:10:05.390
What do I need to do?

00:10:26.270 --> 00:10:27.750
It's me.

00:10:28.120 --> 00:10:28.960
Why are you here?

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:31.240
You minx.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:32.230
Don't touch me.

00:10:33.390 --> 00:10:35.000
Weren't you the one who called me over?

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.510
Why act shy now?

00:10:37.550 --> 00:10:38.670
Erlang said

00:10:38.790 --> 00:10:39.960
that Shen girl was already

00:10:40.150 --> 00:10:42.790
locked up in the backyard,
waiting for drowning in a cage.

00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:44.910
No wonder you're in such a good mood.

00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.960
So, how do you plan to
reward me tonight?

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:53.320
Erlang told you that

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:55.320
Shen Yaochu is about to face drowning?

00:10:55.870 --> 00:10:56.710
Yes, that's right.

00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:58.270
Erlang also said

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:00.080
you wanted me to come over tonight

00:11:00.670 --> 00:11:02.200
to take away this deposit slip

00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.550
and keep you company for a while.

00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.440
Tomorrow, you could deposit
another thousand taels.

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:08.630
During the day, Erlang

00:11:08.750 --> 00:11:11.000
had already been dragged out of the manor
with broken legs.

00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:12.510
That's impossible.

00:11:12.720 --> 00:11:14.320
Erlang was lively and well...

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:17.060
Something's not right.

00:11:17.080 --> 00:11:18.440
That traitor is trying to frame me.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:25.360
Mr. Liu.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:27.120
You set me up first.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:29.030
Don't blame me for this.

00:11:30.270 --> 00:11:31.480
It's dark. Leave now.

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:39.840
What ill fortune.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.670
You shameless woman!

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:45.840
Step back.

00:11:48.030 --> 00:11:48.870
Madam.

00:11:50.030 --> 00:11:50.900
It's so late.

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.390
Why is there a strange man here?

00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:54.120
How would I know these two?

00:11:54.840 --> 00:11:55.680
But you.

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:57.960
He greeted you
the moment you walked in.

00:11:58.240 --> 00:11:59.600
And you claim you don't know him?

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:00.960
Of course I know him.

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.960
He came to help catch the cheater.

00:12:04.630 --> 00:12:05.600
As for this one...

00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.120
Stop making false accusations!

00:12:07.320 --> 00:12:08.160
Catch the cheater?

00:12:10.550 --> 00:12:11.390
Old Madam.

00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.840
Madam tarnishes my honor like this.

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:15.670
You must clear my name, I beg you.

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:19.360
Tarnish your honor?

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:20.870
You mean

00:12:21.080 --> 00:12:22.390
you have nothing to do with him?

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:23.920
Of course.

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:26.030
If you two weren't close,

00:12:26.510 --> 00:12:27.600
why would the head of a bank

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:29.600
visit a lady's room at midnight

00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.390
and help her frame the General's wife?
