00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:35.840
What do you mean?

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:37.280
Qingming Festival is coming soon.

00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:39.200
No matter how rampant the Japanese are,

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.400
they can't stop us from paying respects to our ancestors.

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:44.039
What I mean is,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.880
I'll go with you.

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.500
You're always the clever one.

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.760
Hello.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:48.079
I'm looking for Captain Oshima.

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:49.240
Okay. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:02:50.120 --> 00:02:50.800
Captain.

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:56.440
Captain, sir,

00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.720
the colonel has gone out by car.

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.160
Not sure if he went to see Ye Biying.

00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:03.600
Oh, really?

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:04.960
Was he alone?

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:08.520
He was the only one in the car.

00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:09.720
I see.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.920
Thank you for your hard work.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.330
Thank you very much.

00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:21.800
Captain Jingshang.

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.290
This disguise fits you quite well.

00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:29.360
I'm sorry.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:29.960
What are you doing?

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.560
I'm sorry.

00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.290
I have good news for you.

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:37.440
Really?

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.920
Let's report to Captain Daodao right away.

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:48.280
Captain.

00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.400
Um...

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:52.079
That woman Ye Biying has gone out.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:53.900
Ye Biying has gone out too.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.240
Not just that woman.

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.600
Their whole family has gone out.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.240
Looks like they're going to pay respects to their ancestors.

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.520
Should I send someone to follow them?

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.120
Which direction did they go?

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:03.520
Did they go northwest?

00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.320
Northwest.

00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:06.700
Northwest direction.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:12.850
Should we send someone to follow them?

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:13.880
No.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.520
No need to track them.

00:04:16.079 --> 00:04:17.760
There's only Caotang Village in the northwest.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:18.920
Understood?

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:20.560
Yes.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.380
No need to follow them.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:24.500
That hurts.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.520
I'm sorry.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.120
This outfit really suits you.

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:27.600
Really?

00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:29.240
Thank you.

00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:32.880
Order the second platoon to assemble.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:34.340
Search Caotang Mountain.

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:35.840
I understand.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:07.040
I'll go up and keep watch.

00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:09.400
Be careful.

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.080
You go in first.

00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:37.880
We'll keep watch outside for you.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.320
If anything happens,

00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:41.280
I'll break a bowl to signal you.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:42.400
Don't come out.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:43.840
Hurry up.

00:05:44.159 --> 00:05:44.600
Go ahead.

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.400
Be careful.

00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.520
Major White,

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.080
I'm Ye Biying.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:54.120
I'm coming in.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.680
Second platoon, assemble!

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:23.340
Prepare for mountain search.

00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.610
Target: Caotang Mountain.

00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:29.680
Ready to move out.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:31.640
Upon hearing that the police squad

00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.640
was ordered to search Caotang Village,

00:06:33.640 --> 00:06:34.960
Takemura Ichiro knew

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.000
that Wei Chen could be exposed at any moment.

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.520
He immediately decided to take a risk.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.640
Let's go upstairs to talk.

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.200
Yes.

00:06:55.159 --> 00:06:56.159
This way, please.

00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.400
Sir.

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:01.120
Colonel Wumu is requesting to see you.

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:02.240
Perfect timing.

00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:03.290
Please sit down.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:04.600
Coming at this hour,

00:07:04.600 --> 00:07:05.760
you must have something important.

00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.200
Nothing too important actually.

00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:08.880
My investigation department has been established,

00:07:08.880 --> 00:07:11.010
and I came specifically to inform you.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:14.400
Is this your department for investigating freshwater resources?

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.440
Nothing escapes your eye.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.140
The reason I used this name

00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.880
is to avoid drawing attention and causing panic.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:21.680
By the way,

00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:22.600
I'd like to use your radio

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.280
to report this matter to Tokyo.

00:07:26.320 --> 00:07:27.920
If it's not confidential,

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:29.580
have Deputy Sakamoto send it.

00:07:30.680 --> 00:07:31.520
The thing is,

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:34.120
I'm using the Imperial Palace code.

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.280
The frequency and call sign are written here.

00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.280
It goes directly to Tokyo.

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.159
After it's sent,

00:07:38.159 --> 00:07:39.520
I need to take back the message.

00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.280
I understand.

00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.040
Give it to me.

00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.159
Let's chat.

00:07:50.400 --> 00:07:53.840
Colonel, do you know much about military classics?

00:07:54.159 --> 00:07:55.240
A little bit.

00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:58.880
This is Miyamoto Musashi's

00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:00.560
military treatise, The Book of Five Rings.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:03.360
And this is the Chinese Art of War by Sun Tzu.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.760
Our martial arts

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:07.800
only teach how to use swords.

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.520
Martial arts are

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:12.050
the way of survival for samurai in this world.

00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:15.500
They're essentially about swordsmanship.

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.600
But China's The Art of War

00:08:18.040 --> 00:08:20.600
teaches that the supreme victory

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.520
is to win without fighting.

00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:23.920
It's about philosophy, strategy, and wisdom.

00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:25.880
Conquering such a nation

00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:28.320
is not actually easy.

00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:32.360
The Book of Five Rings

00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:34.159
and China's The Art of War,

00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.929
I've read them both before.

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:38.799
The Art of War is a good book,

00:08:39.679 --> 00:08:41.240
full of philosophy.

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.120
Wumu Yilang was extremely anxious

00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:47.840
because he had no time left.

00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:49.720
He needed to act before

00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.160
the police force discovered Weite Chen.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.960
Now he could only hope

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:57.020
the intelligence would be transmitted successfully.

00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:13.640
It's sent.

00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:15.540
Give me back the original.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:23.040
A freshwater resource investigation unit has been established.

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:23.600
Not bad.

00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:24.820
That's your style.

00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:36.240
The Believer

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:39.320
is about to be exposed.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:44.720
Request Dongjiang Column to immediately organize effective forces

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.720
to attack northern Sanzao Island.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.440
Colonel,

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:54.120
this isn't like you at all.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.120
Emergency call:

00:10:12.120 --> 00:10:14.320
Request Dongjiang Column to immediately organize effective forces

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:18.200
to attack northern Sanzao Island and notify Director Shen.

00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:23.360
The lumberjack telegraphed to organize effective forces

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.890
to attack the northern part of Sanzao Island.

00:10:33.840 --> 00:10:35.370
You're from Sanzao Island.

00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:36.440
Yes.

00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:40.640
We've received your telegram.

00:10:40.920 --> 00:10:42.000
I want to ask you

00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.600
how did you establish contact with the island?

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.820
It's like this.

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:49.020
There's still a wealthy family on the island

00:10:49.280 --> 00:10:50.920
that maintains some connections

00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:52.720
with Anlan Hall in Macau's Eighth District.

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.050
The telegram sent to you

00:10:54.120 --> 00:10:56.840
came through this channel.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.820
Among all those who escaped from the island,

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.920
I'm the only one who worked for the government.

00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:03.640
When there are government matters,

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.000
they often come to me.

00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.920
What kind of organization

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:09.440
is the Anlan Hall from District Eight?

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.200
It's an association formed by

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:13.160
wealthy islanders in Macau.

00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:14.360
Who's the leader?

00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.340
The Ye family from Tanjiawan.

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:17.360
The head is

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.440
Ye Degong.

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:22.040
Is Anlan Hall his too?

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:25.120
The leader of Anlan Hall is Ye Zhaogeng,

00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:26.960
also a relative of the Ye family.

00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.440
These are two brothers.

00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:30.930
Yes, Director Shen.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.120
I understand.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:35.040
On Sanzao Island,

00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:36.440
the only family that has contact with the outside world

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.520
is the Ye family,

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.050
correct?

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:38.760
Yes.

00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:42.120
The Ye family has a daughter named Ye Biying.

00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:45.240
Do you know them?

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:46.720
Yes, I do.

00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:48.000
Hmm.

00:11:49.520 --> 00:11:50.000
Report.

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:51.040
Come in.

00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:56.840
Director Shen,

00:11:56.840 --> 00:11:58.170
Lumberjack is calling.

00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:00.960
Wu Fazi.

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:02.440
Welcome.

00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:03.240
Today

00:12:04.040 --> 00:12:05.920
you'll be on standby for our orders.

00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:06.560
Alright.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:07.280
Please.

00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:18.520
Lumberjack is calling,

00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.080
requesting an immediate artillery attack

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.210
on the northern part of Sanzao Island.

00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:28.960
Is there an error in your translation?

00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:30.090
No error, Director.

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:33.360
Wang Jia,

00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:35.720
bring Commander Yuan to my office immediately.

00:12:35.720 --> 00:12:36.200
One more thing,

00:12:36.200 --> 00:12:37.800
tell everyone to pack their bags.

00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:39.000
We're going to Macao.

00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:42.360
You may go now.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:47.720
Director Shen.

00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.240
Something's come up.

00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:49.960
Commander Yuan,

00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:51.320
the situation has changed.

00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:52.280
You just mentioned

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.440
what's the name of the unit closest to Sanzao Island?

00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:56.200
The Second Battalion of the Seventh Detachment.

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.260
Communist forces.

00:12:57.560 --> 00:12:58.120
This one.

00:12:58.560 --> 00:13:00.560
And what about the strait closest to Sanzao Island?

00:13:00.560 --> 00:13:02.200
How far is it from the island?

00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:05.000
About 500 to 600 meters at the closest point.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.280
However,

00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.640
there are bunker clusters on the opposite shore.

00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:11.360
These patrol boats

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.760
patrol once every half hour.

00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:14.520
The defense is extremely tight.

00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:15.200
All right.

00:13:15.960 --> 00:13:17.690
Notify our people immediately

00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:19.880
to launch an attack on the northern shore.

00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:20.600
Use up all our shells

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.040
and ammunition.

00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:23.720
Don't conserve anything.

00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:25.250
The more noise, the better.

00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:26.760
After the attack,

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:28.960
I'll make sure headquarters doubles your supplies.

00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:29.680
Understood?

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.440
The more commotion, the better.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.240
Can you start the battle within half an hour?

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:34.100
Director Shen,

00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:35.000
rest assured,

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:36.440
I'll send the message right away.

00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:39.300
We'll definitely start firing within half an hour.

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.560
Our military's propaganda slogan claims

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.080
that before the war with China,

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.960
for over 300 years,

00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.560
Japan had never lost

00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.800
a foreign war.

00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:49.880
Those people in the military headquarters

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:51.210
are all ignorant fools.

00:13:52.360 --> 00:13:54.420
Our Japan is a typical island nation,

00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:56.360
narrow from north to south,

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.020
and shallow from east to west.

00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:59.680
Resources are scarce,

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:01.250
and arable land is limited.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:04.640
The total area is only 370,000 square kilometers,

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.440
one twenty-fifth of America's territory,

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.560
and one twenty-seventh of China's.

00:14:08.960 --> 00:14:10.240
Bordered by the Pacific Ocean to the east,

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.970
and the Sea of Japan to the west.

00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:15.160
If one day the war reaches our homeland,

00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:16.600
it could easily be divided by enemies.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.000
That would be dangerous.

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.460
His Majesty the Emperor shares these concerns.

00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.720
As long as we're fighting abroad,

00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:30.040
it means the territory of our Great Japanese Empire

00:14:30.040 --> 00:14:31.160
remains safe.

00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.400
If one day we have to fight on our own soil,

00:14:35.680 --> 00:14:38.410
then the Great Japanese Empire will be in danger.

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:42.080
So General, you mean

00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:43.760
this is the only way

00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:45.700
to avoid danger, correct?

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:49.400
More than 80 years ago,

00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:50.730
Yoshida Shoin proposed

00:14:50.880 --> 00:14:51.760
taking Korea,

00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:52.560
seizing Manchuria,

00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:53.600
suppressing China,

00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:54.280
approaching India,

00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:54.960
to expand our territory,

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.160
and establish a defensive foundation.

00:14:57.440 --> 00:14:59.120
Not losing a war for over 300 years

00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:00.920
is what our ancestors taught us:

00:15:01.120 --> 00:15:03.440
Japan can only fight on external lines.

00:15:05.760 --> 00:15:07.690
I remember more than 100 years ago,

00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:08.960
our pioneer,

00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:11.560
Sato Nobuyuki said something similar.

00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:12.880
He said,

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:16.440
'The world should be our prefecture and all foreign kings our servants.'

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:17.560
He advocated that we should

00:15:17.560 --> 00:15:21.360
sweep through northern China and make Nanjing our imperial palace.

00:15:22.720 --> 00:15:25.320
The Major seems quite knowledgeable about history.

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.050
What we're doing here is merely

00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:30.810
fulfilling the wishes of our ancestors from over a century ago.

00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:36.000
Colonel,

00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:37.840
here's your manuscript.

00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:39.760
Good. Thank you.

00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:43.560
General,

00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.960
I'll take my leave now.

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:47.970
It was a pleasure talking with you.

00:15:48.080 --> 00:15:49.610
Won't you stay a bit longer?

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.680
I need to pick up Miss Ye.

00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:58.240
There's no stopping young people in these matters.

00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:01.480
It's nice to have family around.

00:16:08.040 --> 00:16:08.880
Actually,

00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:12.860
I just reunited with my family recently too.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:15.730
If it weren't for this mission,

00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.720
I wouldn't have come back to Sanzao Island.

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:21.160
So I can understand how you feel.

00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:24.810
Take it easy.

00:16:26.400 --> 00:16:28.530
Your wound is hurting again, isn't it?

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.620
I really don't know

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:38.780
how you've managed to survive all this time.

00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.520
Don't worry.

00:16:56.520 --> 00:16:57.560
Wumu will definitely find a way

00:16:57.560 --> 00:16:59.160
to help you escape from here.

00:17:10.440 --> 00:17:11.520
What's this?

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:12.819
A wedding ring.

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:15.440
You're married?

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.880
For two years now.

00:17:24.359 --> 00:17:25.440
Do you know

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:27.839
where I

00:17:27.839 --> 00:17:28.840
proposed to her?

00:17:31.400 --> 00:17:33.660
At the entrance to her family's kitchen.

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.280
When we got married,

00:17:39.120 --> 00:17:40.180
we were both drunk.

00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:42.280
We have a child too.

00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.240
I wasn't there when she was born.

00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:49.360
They told me before I got on the plane

00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:51.760
that it was a girl.

00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.360
But I'm sorry,

00:17:58.200 --> 00:17:59.530
I don't have any photos.

00:17:59.920 --> 00:18:00.600
Otherwise,

00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.240
I could show you what she looks like.

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.400
But it's okay.

00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:09.320
She must be beautiful.

00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:14.000
She probably looks like her mother.

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.200
Actually, the reason you asked me to come today

00:18:25.800 --> 00:18:29.000
is because you want me to help you escape from here, right?

00:18:31.080 --> 00:18:31.680
Yes.

00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:35.360
In my current condition,

00:18:37.240 --> 00:18:38.570
I can't leave by myself.

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:40.200
I need your help.

00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:42.200
You know,

00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:44.080
when you told me

00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:45.770
I could be smuggled out,

00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:50.300
I really thought I was going to see my daughter soon.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:57.320
I desperately need to get out of this hellhole.

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.280
Although I don't know what mission you're carrying out

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:02.210
or what your assignment really is,

00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:03.320
but I do know

00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:05.240
that every daughter

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:07.240
must want to see her father.

00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:25.120
Longxia.

00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:28.000
What's wrong?

00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.400
The Japanese are here.

00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:30.660
The Japanese are here.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:32.680
How did they find out so quickly?

00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:39.650
Something's happened.

00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.640
Let's go upstairs

00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:44.440
and distract them.

00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:45.120
Okay.

00:20:00.760 --> 00:20:01.290
Set it up.

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:02.040
Si Po.

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.170
Arrange the dishes.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:27.600
What a coincidence,

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.440
Mr. Ye,

00:20:28.560 --> 00:20:30.160
running into you here.

00:20:31.720 --> 00:20:32.850
What a coincidence,

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:35.040
meeting you people everywhere.

00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:36.680
Today I

00:20:36.680 --> 00:20:39.540
brought my family to pay respects to our ancestors.

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.520
If you need to conduct military drills,

00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:43.240
please do it somewhere else.

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:45.300
Show respect for the deceased

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.650
and don't disturb them.

00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:47.640
Thank you.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.330
Where is Miss Ye?

00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:04.200
Where's Miss Ye?

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:12.000
We...

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:12.760
Father.

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:15.800
You're back.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:16.280
Look,

00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.170
great-grandfather's favorite yellow flowers.

00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.160
Put them there.

00:21:42.760 --> 00:21:44.760
You go that way. The rest, follow me.

00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:45.800
Yes, sir.

00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:49.840
How come there's not a single trace?

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:52.000
Search further ahead. The visibility here is too poor.

00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:53.000
Look carefully.

00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.700
It must be somewhere around here.

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.640
Let's check over there.

00:23:24.240 --> 00:23:25.280
Copy that.

00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:33.840
Sir!

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:35.080
We have an emergency!

00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.140
What's happening?

00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:39.360
The northern section of the base is under attack.

00:23:39.360 --> 00:23:40.680
A small guerrilla force

00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:42.320
dares to attack our base.

00:23:42.360 --> 00:23:43.560
Have they gone mad?

00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:45.440
The gunfire is extremely heavy.

00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:46.360
They're going all out.

00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:47.800
What are you panicking for?

00:23:47.800 --> 00:23:48.840
Sound the battle alarm.

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:50.320
Order the garrison battalion to get there.

00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.320
The patrol boat squadron must deploy immediately for support.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.000
Also,

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:54.840
order the air squadron to launch bombers,

00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:56.200
identify the attack positions,

00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:58.400
and commence air strikes immediately.

00:23:58.720 --> 00:23:59.120
Go now!

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:06.640
Fall in!

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:08.240
Hurry up!

00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.000
Move it!

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.490
What's going on?

00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:42.800
Those gunshots

00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:46.060
seem to be coming from the north side of the base.

00:24:46.680 --> 00:24:48.200
It's possible that

00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:50.000
they found that American there.

00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:52.120
I see.

00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:54.640
Let's go check it out.

00:24:56.360 --> 00:24:57.690
Let's move! Let's move!

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.760
Wumu knew

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:14.880
this attack

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.240
could only ease the immediate danger.

00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:20.760
Caotang Village was already on Oshima Hiroshi's radar.

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.960
He had to relocate Major White as soon as possible.

00:25:30.800 --> 00:25:33.720
These people are getting bolder

00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:35.000
in broad daylight.

00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:36.560
Do they really dare to attack the base?

00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:37.400
Yes,

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:39.520
this has never happened before.

00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:46.970
Even the air squadron has been mobilized.

00:25:49.640 --> 00:25:51.040
Chongqing 08596 Biying.

00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.890
Chongqing 08596 Ye Biying.

00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:56.400
Biying.

00:25:56.960 --> 00:25:57.560
Wumu.

00:25:59.600 --> 00:26:01.600
Mr. Ye, is Biying here?

00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.440
Come in.

00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.960
I just accompanied Ying'er to the cave

00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:07.760
to change the Major's bandages.

00:26:07.880 --> 00:26:10.760
Our family pretended to be paying respects to ancestors

00:26:10.760 --> 00:26:12.280
to provide cover for her.

00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:13.600
But soon after,

00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.200
the Japanese came to search the mountain.

00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.880
They were about to discover the cave entrance

00:26:16.880 --> 00:26:18.600
when fortunately we heard cannon fire.

00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:19.440
Otherwise,

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:21.400
the consequences would have been unimaginable.

00:26:21.400 --> 00:26:23.280
It might be because of your ancestral worship on the mountain

00:26:23.280 --> 00:26:24.920
that drew the attention of the police squad

00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:26.120
to Caotang Mountain.

00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.200
Too many people.

00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:29.320
It was my oversight.

00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.520
Where did that cannon fire come from?

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:32.080
How could it be such a coincidence?

00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:32.800
Indeed.

00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:33.760
It was assisted by the Military Statistics Bureau

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:35.420
in a diversionary operation.

00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:39.240
You just said Biying went to change the Major's bandages,

00:26:39.240 --> 00:26:41.000
but didn't she just do that not long ago?

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.600
She said she had an appointment with the Major.

00:26:44.560 --> 00:26:45.820
Where is the Major now?

00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:46.840
Where is Biying?

00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.840
Tonight's smuggling meeting point is at Jinwan Beach.

00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:51.280
Ying'er is taking care of the Major in the cave.

00:26:51.280 --> 00:26:52.720
She should be back soon.

00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.040
I understand.

00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:54.840
Mr. Ye,

00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.400
I'll go bring Biying back first.

00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:57.040
All right.

00:26:58.600 --> 00:26:59.860
Be careful on your way.

00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:21.160
The sound is gone.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:24.720
Has the gunfire stopped?

00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:27.400
Seems so.

00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:31.600
Get in the car.

00:28:32.440 --> 00:28:33.440
Why are you here?

00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:37.040
How long were you planning to hide this from me?

00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.400
Where are you taking me?

00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:05.640
Stop the car.

00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.890
I said stop the car. Did you hear me?

00:29:08.920 --> 00:29:09.840
Stop!

00:29:18.920 --> 00:29:20.200
If you don't want him to die,

00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:20.920
you'd better tell me right now

00:29:20.920 --> 00:29:21.720
where he is.

00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.320
Who's trying to kill him?

00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:29.100
What are you doing?

00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:30.570
Someone is watching us.

00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:31.600
Don't move.

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:34.120
Don't you know the police unit

00:29:34.120 --> 00:29:35.920
has been watching you all along?

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.000
How is that possible?

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:43.960
You had just arrived at Caotang Mountain

00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.080
when they came searching right after you.

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:47.000
If the Military Intelligence hadn't

00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:48.680
created a diversion with a raid,

00:29:48.680 --> 00:29:49.720
you and Weite would be

00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.400
in the police interrogation room

00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.460
being questioned by Oshima Hiroshi.

00:29:53.600 --> 00:29:55.560
You would also implicate your father,

00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:56.640
your brother,

00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:57.840
Sipo,

00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.880
and even the entire village.

00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:02.840
I won't let that happen.

00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.400
What makes you say that?

00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.680
What power do you have to prevent it?

00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:15.880
Think about it.

00:30:15.880 --> 00:30:17.720
They'll assign one person to watch you,

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:18.960
then a second one,

00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.000
and a third.

00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.650
Without my protection,

00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:23.260
your recklessness

00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:24.400
will sooner or later

00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:25.560
put them in danger.

00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:27.610
Is that what you want to see?

00:30:35.320 --> 00:30:36.160
I promise you,

00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:38.320
after I meet Weite,

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.880
as long as it doesn't affect the bigger picture,

00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:42.340
I will respect his wishes.

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:49.640
Tell me where he is.

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.440
It's just ahead.

00:31:34.200 --> 00:31:35.200
Wait.

00:31:39.160 --> 00:31:39.920
Over there.

00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:47.720
Major,

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:49.720
it's me.

00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:57.960
Major White.

00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.480
Are you sure you hid him here?

00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:01.960
Yes, I'm sure.

00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:04.560
That's strange.

00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.080
Stop looking.

00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:08.810
He knew you would bring me here,

00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.200
so he hid himself.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:20.440
What do we do now?

00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:23.980
I hope before the smuggling time,

00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:26.800
he won't be discovered by the Japanese.

00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:28.240
Wait.

00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:30.400
Are you saying you agree

00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:31.660
to the smuggling plan?

00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:34.720
Do I have a choice?

00:32:40.760 --> 00:32:42.000
Where are you going?

00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:55.400
There used to be defensive fortifications here.

00:32:55.400 --> 00:32:57.040
As the war in Southeast Asia expanded,

00:32:57.040 --> 00:32:58.440
they were all relocated.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:32:59.960
Now only barbed wire remains,

00:32:59.960 --> 00:33:01.240
and empty bunkers.

00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:07.320
What are you doing?

00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:09.960
It says 'landmines' there!

00:33:10.440 --> 00:33:11.300
Don't go there!

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:13.560
Wait for me here.

00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:14.800
Don't move.

00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:15.960
Wumu!

00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:18.880
Wumu!

[Sakura Maru]

00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:46.120
The patrol boat indeed

00:33:46.120 --> 00:33:47.650
comes once every half hour.

00:33:49.120 --> 00:33:50.240
When we cross over tonight,

00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:52.170
this information will be crucial.

00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:55.240
Ye Biying.

00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:57.220
While we still have some time,

00:33:57.880 --> 00:33:59.540
we need to make preparations.

00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.930
Are you trying to get yourself killed?

00:34:36.239 --> 00:34:37.239
[Salute]

00:34:41.679 --> 00:34:43.040
The flying lighter

00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:44.840
refers to this type of aircraft, right?

00:34:44.840 --> 00:34:45.840
Yes.

00:34:48.199 --> 00:34:48.600
I mean,

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.440
on February 5 last year,

00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:52.239
was General Okaku Mineo who crashed

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:54.159
also flying this type of aircraft?

00:34:54.159 --> 00:34:55.620
Reporting, Colonel, sir.

00:34:55.960 --> 00:34:57.360
The navy generals

00:34:57.360 --> 00:34:59.560
all prefer to use this type of aircraft.

00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:03.240
Admiral Yamamoto Isoroku chose it.

00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:05.800
General Osumi was flying

00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:07.520
this Type I land-based attack aircraft

00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:08.720
at that time.

00:35:10.360 --> 00:35:11.760
I've heard that this aircraft

00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:13.820
doesn't have good armor protection.

00:35:14.680 --> 00:35:16.080
Yes, Colonel.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.200
When this aircraft was manufactured,

00:35:18.200 --> 00:35:18.960
it wasn't equipped with

00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:21.360
armor plating or self-sealing fuel tanks.

00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:25.000
That's why they were shot down in large numbers.

00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:26.280
Extremely unlucky.

00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.560
I see.

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:30.520
Mitsubishi Corporation

00:35:30.520 --> 00:35:31.360
still hasn't

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:33.620
made any improvements to this aircraft.

00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.360
I need this aircraft's fuel line

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.740
to take back and examine thoroughly.

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:46.080
I'm currently investigating an accident.

00:35:46.080 --> 00:35:47.440
According to the pilot,

00:35:47.440 --> 00:35:48.720
ice formation in the fuel lines causes

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:50.680
one of the engine's heat exchangers

00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:51.760
to lose power.

00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.080
Is that true?

00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.160
In the cold regions of Hokkaido,

00:35:57.160 --> 00:35:58.820
this risk definitely exists.

00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.080
Even now the manufacturing company

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:01.760
is unable to effectively

00:36:01.760 --> 00:36:03.520
solve this problem.

00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.360
It's truly difficult to prevent

00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:10.160
water vapor in fuel from freezing in cold regions.

00:36:11.280 --> 00:36:14.040
But this is a southern subtropical region,

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:18.200
so this risk absolutely shouldn't exist.

00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.360
How do you know the temperature up there

00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.920
won't drop below freezing?

00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:36.200
This special agent is very professional.

00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.440
Is that all?

00:37:02.760 --> 00:37:04.000
That's all.

00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:06.620
According to what you're saying,

00:37:06.880 --> 00:37:08.400
it really was just one time.

00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.930
An attack with no clear strategic objective?

00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:11.880
Yes.

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:13.810
We suffered no casualties either.

00:37:16.240 --> 00:37:18.600
Our enemy fired all their weapons

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.360
just to make me

00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.760
hear some noise?

00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:26.920
Oshima.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.240
Yes?

00:37:28.520 --> 00:37:29.640
What do you think?

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:32.200
This attack is very suspicious.

00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:33.680
We need time

00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:35.880
to determine the purpose of the attack.

00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.440
The base has been established for over four years,

00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:42.640
and this is the first time something so strange has happened.

00:37:42.640 --> 00:37:44.200
You must investigate thoroughly

00:37:44.200 --> 00:37:45.960
and give me a reasonable explanation.

00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:46.880
Yes, sir.

00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:50.440
Order the base guards to maintain patrol duty.

00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:53.280
Proceed according to the combat plan.

00:38:05.120 --> 00:38:05.680
What about the Caotang Mountain area?

00:38:05.680 --> 00:38:07.080
Did we leave staff on duty?

00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.640
We left twenty people there

00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:10.720
and set up ten sentry posts.

00:38:10.720 --> 00:38:11.520
At dawn tomorrow,

00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:13.050
we'll continue the search.

00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:14.200
Let's hope this person

00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.800
is still within our control.

00:38:17.240 --> 00:38:18.760
What's the situation with the Ye family?

00:38:18.760 --> 00:38:19.760
They were at the ancestral ceremony,

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:23.240
but rushed back when they heard gunfire.

00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:24.820
They've returned.

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.600
We didn't see Ye Biying at first,

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:28.920
but our surveillance later reported

00:38:28.920 --> 00:38:31.320
she went to the beach with the Major.

00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:33.560
What are they doing at the beach?

00:38:34.440 --> 00:38:36.160
I suppose even the Major occasionally needs

00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.040
to be romantic with his lover.

00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:39.920
Is that so?

00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:42.320
Sasaki,

00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:44.320
call the patrol boat unit for me.

00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:46.120
Things aren't peaceful lately.

00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:48.840
If the Americans can't find him,

00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:51.530
he still can't stay on the island forever.

00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:53.680
Ask the patrol boat unit to increase patrols

00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:54.880
to once every twenty minutes.

00:38:54.880 --> 00:38:55.800
Understood?

00:38:55.920 --> 00:38:56.880
Understood.

00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:16.920
Biying.

00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:18.320
It's about time.

00:39:21.880 --> 00:39:23.000
Mr. Wumu.

00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:24.480
We still have some time.

00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:26.010
Come have something to eat.

00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.250
I need to talk to you.

00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:30.640
Mrs. Si.

00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:32.480
Please bring another set of dishes.

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:33.680
I'll get a chair.

00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:44.580
Have a seat.

00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:45.760
Thank you.

00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:52.610
Go ahead and eat.

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:54.640
Mr. Ye.

00:39:55.680 --> 00:39:57.080
This is the first time

00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:01.130
I've eaten in a Chinese home since I can remember.

00:40:02.920 --> 00:40:04.040
Come on, let's eat.

00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:04.880
Eat up.

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:05.720
Thank you.

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:09.810
Have some bread.

00:40:09.920 --> 00:40:10.600
Here.

00:40:15.520 --> 00:40:16.400
Thanks.

00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:23.520
Our home hasn't been

00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:25.050
this lively for a long time.

00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:27.450
With you here today,

00:40:28.040 --> 00:40:29.440
it's much more cheerful.

00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:31.640
So I'd like to

00:40:31.720 --> 00:40:32.840
take this opportunity

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:34.080
thank you.

00:40:35.960 --> 00:40:36.600
When Ying'er

00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:37.880
gets to Macau,

00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:40.090
please take care of her.

00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:43.320
Mr. Ye.

00:40:43.720 --> 00:40:45.240
This is all part of my duty.

00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:46.610
Please don't worry.

00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:48.770
All of you can rest assured.

00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:50.040
What else?

00:40:50.520 --> 00:40:51.320
Tonight,

00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:53.960
I want

00:40:53.960 --> 00:40:55.560
Xia'er to leave with you all.

00:40:57.760 --> 00:40:59.600
We've discussed this more than once.

00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:00.080
As long as you're here,

00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.410
I'm not going anywhere.

00:41:01.560 --> 00:41:02.560
Why stay with me

00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:03.440
on this island?

00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:06.440
What's the point of keeping an old man like me company?

00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:08.000
You're still so young.

00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.440
Staying here with me will only hold you back.

00:41:10.440 --> 00:41:11.800
Leave while you still can.

00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:12.680
Just go.

00:41:12.680 --> 00:41:13.920
Don't wait until it's too late.

00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:15.120
You can't escape now.

00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:16.920
Please stop trying to persuade me.

00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:17.850
I'm not leaving.

00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:23.120
Don't worry.

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:24.320
Once I get to Macau

00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:26.320
and deliver Major White there,

00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:27.920
I'll come back to be with you.

00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:30.240
Don't ever come back to this island.

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:31.760
After you reach Macau,

00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:33.560
I hope you'll

00:41:33.560 --> 00:41:34.920
continue on to America

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:36.120
to find your brother.

00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:38.200
No.

00:41:38.680 --> 00:41:40.340
I will come back to be with you.

00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:44.320
Wumu.

00:41:44.840 --> 00:41:47.040
You're well aware of the situation out there.

00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.200
After it's done,

00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:51.410
can you keep her under control?

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.330
She will obey my orders.

00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:54.680
Don't worry.

00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:55.280
Good.

00:41:56.520 --> 00:41:57.160
Good.

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:00.960
Ying'er.

00:42:02.480 --> 00:42:03.960
When you get to Macau,

00:42:05.400 --> 00:42:07.060
give my regards to your uncle.

00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:08.800
Listen to his advice

00:42:09.040 --> 00:42:11.240
on how to enter the mainland from Macau.

00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000
I understand.

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.080
Come, eat.

00:42:18.520 --> 00:42:19.400
Long Xia.

00:42:20.640 --> 00:42:22.120
After I leave,

00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:22.840
there's one more thing

00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:24.040
I need your help with.

00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:25.800
Sure.

00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:26.760
What is it?

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:29.730
Let's talk after we finish eating.

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:31.220
