00:01:11.599 --> 00:01:12.920
What are you looking at?

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:14.480
I'm looking to see

00:01:14.599 --> 00:01:17.000
if that's the sun or the moon hanging there.

00:01:18.599 --> 00:01:19.599
These past two weeks,

00:01:19.599 --> 00:01:21.159
my sons have all come back to visit.

00:01:21.159 --> 00:01:22.959
I'm afraid I can't handle all this good fortune.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:27.879
Hey, Xiao Hai.

00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.519
Did the art exhibition go well?

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:31.040
It went quite well, Mom.

00:01:31.359 --> 00:01:31.959
And... (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:32.799 --> 00:01:34.280
it wasn't just the exhibition that went well.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.120
What do you mean?

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:41.200
Could it be...

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.040
my eldest son is seeing someone too?

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:45.599
Mom.

00:01:46.439 --> 00:01:48.079
We're still just in the dating phase.

00:01:48.640 --> 00:01:49.959
But I really like her.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.840
I believe it won't be long

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.640
before I bring her home

00:01:52.799 --> 00:01:53.599
to meet you and Dad.

00:01:54.519 --> 00:01:55.239
That's great.

00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.000
I have to go meet someone later.

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:00.400
Don't go.

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.479
You seem very concerned about Mr. Mo Fei.

00:02:12.319 --> 00:02:13.599
I don't like this person.

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:17.560
Did you know each other before?

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.599
Is there something

00:02:22.599 --> 00:02:23.919
you can't tell me?

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:26.319
I just want to confirm some things from the past.

00:02:33.039 --> 00:02:34.039
I don't like anyone

00:02:34.039 --> 00:02:35.280
interfering in my private affairs.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:35.639
Including...

00:02:35.639 --> 00:02:36.319
Including me?

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:42.400
Anyway, I'm going to meet him.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:43.960
And I hope Secretary Lin

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.960
won't stop me again.

00:02:52.439 --> 00:02:53.240
Xiao Hai.

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:54.560
Tell Mom quickly,

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.000
what kind of girl is she?

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:01.479
She is very smart.

00:03:01.639 --> 00:03:02.280
And...

00:03:02.639 --> 00:03:03.879
cheerful and strong.

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.159
Her family background is also quite good.

00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.039
By the way,

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:08.960
your younger brother knows her too.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:10.159
Really?

00:03:11.439 --> 00:03:13.159
I have something to do, I'm leaving first.

00:03:17.560 --> 00:03:19.080
My sensible youngest son

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.520
is really so polite.

00:03:40.639 --> 00:03:41.560
To be honest,

00:03:41.840 --> 00:03:42.960
when I went to see you that day,

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.240
I wasn't very confident

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.159
that you would come to see me.

00:03:47.280 --> 00:03:47.840
Actually, I

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:49.199
have always been very interested

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:50.280
in Mr. Mo Fei's

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.280
Ferris Wheel Series.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.360
So,

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.960
I wanted to know the source of your inspiration.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.719
That is a story that is both thrilling

00:03:59.639 --> 00:04:01.039
and heartwarming.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:02.639
Thrilling?

00:04:06.199 --> 00:04:07.360
When I was ten years old,

00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:09.719
I got separated from my younger brother at the amusement park.

00:04:10.319 --> 00:04:12.080
I was pushed into the Ferris wheel by the crowd.

00:04:17.800 --> 00:04:18.639
Look.

00:04:22.279 --> 00:04:22.920
There.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.399
Look over there.

00:04:31.399 --> 00:04:32.480
Is it that one?

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:34.360
But suddenly, an accident happened.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:41.439
Sister, I'm scared.

00:04:41.439 --> 00:04:42.120
Little brother.

00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.759
Don't be afraid.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.759
Sister Meili will protect you.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.000
Little brother, don't be afraid, okay?

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.800
Sister Meili will protect you.

00:04:50.399 --> 00:04:51.759
I was trapped inside

00:04:51.759 --> 00:04:53.120
for a full four hours.

00:04:53.639 --> 00:04:54.800
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid.

00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:56.160
Four hours of fear.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.279
Don't be afraid.

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:58.600
Sister Meili...

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.519
But fortunately,

00:04:59.519 --> 00:05:00.240
will protect you.

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:01.439
the one with me...

00:05:01.439 --> 00:05:02.240
Little brother...

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:03.399
was a little girl.

00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.439
You are Little Brother Lin?

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.360
When I met you for the first time,

00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:12.160
I said that

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.279
we had met before.

00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:14.759
And Miss Qin,

00:05:14.759 --> 00:05:15.879
you also know my younger brother.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:17.839
He is Lin Han.

00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.399
Secretary Lin.

00:05:20.639 --> 00:05:21.399
But...

00:05:21.399 --> 00:05:22.720
isn't your surname Mo?

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.399
Let me reintroduce myself.

00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:28.120
I am Lin Hai,

00:05:28.639 --> 00:05:29.600
Lin Han's older brother.

00:05:57.839 --> 00:05:58.639
Meili!

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.120
Where did you run off to?

00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:02.439
I've been looking everywhere for you.

00:06:02.439 --> 00:06:03.920
Didn't I tell you not to run around?

00:06:03.920 --> 00:06:04.600
This is her mother.

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:04.959
Are you okay?

00:06:04.959 --> 00:06:05.519
I'm fine.

00:06:05.519 --> 00:06:06.319
As long as you admit it.

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:07.639
Is this his mother?

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.959
Is this a new friend you've made?

00:06:09.319 --> 00:06:10.000
Probably, probably.

00:06:10.439 --> 00:06:11.839
Why are you all alone?

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:12.920
Mom.

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.279
He is Little Brother Lin.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:15.319
Little brother,

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:16.480
what is your name?

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:18.759
My name is Lin...

00:06:22.040 --> 00:06:24.040
That little boy back then was named Lin...

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:27.360
Lin...

00:06:31.959 --> 00:06:32.959
Hello, Secretary Lin?

00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:34.199
Are you feeling any better?

00:06:35.759 --> 00:06:36.160
Um...

00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:38.480
will you come to the hiking trip tomorrow?

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:40.639
Hiking?

00:06:43.199 --> 00:06:44.399
I can, no problem.

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:46.720
Great, that's great!

00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:51.519
Done.

00:06:51.519 --> 00:06:52.800
Get your gear ready.

00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.920
President Qin.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:08.040
Are you looking for Secretary Lin?

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:09.560
He didn't come today either.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:10.920
I know.

00:07:11.199 --> 00:07:12.160
He's sick, right?

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:13.199
He needs some rest.

00:07:13.639 --> 00:07:14.680
Sick?

00:07:15.759 --> 00:07:17.920
Didn't he just agree to go hiking tomorrow?

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:21.000
Hiking?

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.720
Oh, right.

00:07:22.959 --> 00:07:23.920
The department gathering.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:25.360
They say it happens every year.

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:27.319
You didn't know?

00:07:27.319 --> 00:07:28.360
I didn't know.

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:29.920
That's why I said last time,

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:31.000
this is isolation.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.040
It's discrimination.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.279
It's workplace bullying.

00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:34.759
But...

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.480
but this is a company event.

00:07:55.079 --> 00:07:55.879
Fine.

00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:01.240
Hurry up and keep up.

00:08:19.240 --> 00:08:21.279
How did we go from drinking heavily at the foot-of-mountain inn

00:08:21.279 --> 00:08:22.720
enjoying a happy two-day, one-night getaway

00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:23.319
to

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:24.920
actually climbing a mountain?

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:26.680
Why?

00:08:26.839 --> 00:08:28.240
I even wore high heels

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.040
for Secretary Lin.

00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:31.279
Every year around this time,

00:08:31.839 --> 00:08:33.679
she completely forgets about it.

00:08:33.879 --> 00:08:35.200
Someone must have tipped her off.

00:08:35.639 --> 00:08:36.399
Who among us

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:38.080
has the biggest mouth?

00:08:44.559 --> 00:08:45.480
Keep it up, everyone!

00:08:45.759 --> 00:08:47.080
We're almost at the summit.

00:08:47.559 --> 00:08:48.360
Boss,

00:08:48.759 --> 00:08:49.879
everyone is very tired.

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:50.919
Should we take a break?

00:08:51.039 --> 00:08:51.840
Tired?

00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.440
How could you be tired?

00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.799
We've only been climbing for a short while.

00:08:54.919 --> 00:08:55.960
Three hours.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:56.679
You have to understand,

00:08:56.679 --> 00:08:57.519
not everyone

00:08:57.519 --> 00:08:59.120
can be as exceptional as you are.

00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.200
Yes, boss.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.440
How about we split into two groups?

00:09:04.879 --> 00:09:06.960
The tired group rests here,

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.919
and those who aren't tired keep climbing.

00:09:09.120 --> 00:09:10.440
We'll stay in touch.

00:09:11.039 --> 00:09:11.919
Anyway, later tonight

00:09:11.919 --> 00:09:13.279
we still have to meet up at the inn.

00:09:13.279 --> 00:09:14.080
Right?

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:14.960
Fine.

00:09:15.519 --> 00:09:16.320
So, who's not tired?

00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:17.159
Come with me.

00:09:21.639 --> 00:09:23.279
Looks like it's just me.

00:09:25.679 --> 00:09:26.919
Alright, let's go then.

00:09:27.559 --> 00:09:28.639
Hurry up, you guys!

00:09:28.799 --> 00:09:29.440
Bye!

00:09:30.159 --> 00:09:31.000
Okay, bye.

00:09:47.759 --> 00:09:48.559
Boss,

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:49.799
your phone.

00:09:57.240 --> 00:09:58.039
Hello?

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.519
My dear Meili,

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.679
what are you doing?

00:10:01.759 --> 00:10:03.080
That kind of address

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.399
is quite embarrassing.

00:10:07.039 --> 00:10:07.840
Sorry.

00:10:08.639 --> 00:10:10.559
I was just calling you like I did when we were kids.

00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.440
Ever since we talked the other day,

00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:15.279
I've been missing you a lot.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.279
I wonder when we can meet again.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:21.639
When I need you to.

00:10:25.039 --> 00:10:26.679
You're still the same as when you were little,

00:10:26.879 --> 00:10:28.039
direct and decisive.

00:10:29.559 --> 00:10:30.360
Well then,

00:10:30.679 --> 00:10:31.559
I'll wait for you.

00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.039
Let's go.

00:10:57.279 --> 00:10:58.080
Secretary Lin,

00:10:59.919 --> 00:11:01.000
do you want to rest for a bit?

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.159
Okay.

00:11:32.559 --> 00:11:33.360
What is it?

00:11:37.399 --> 00:11:38.200
Don't move.

00:12:00.879 --> 00:12:01.960
There's a first-aid bandage in the bag.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.279
There, that should be fine.

00:12:11.559 --> 00:12:12.840
We'll get it checked at the hospital later.

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:15.559
You already know, don't you?

00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:17.759
Lin Hai,

00:12:18.639 --> 00:12:19.639
also known as Mo Fei,

00:12:20.720 --> 00:12:21.720
is my older brother.

00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:25.120
I already know.

00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:27.720
Why do you cling

00:12:27.720 --> 00:12:28.639
to the past?

00:12:30.399 --> 00:12:32.080
The past is in the past.

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:33.320
It holds no meaning.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:34.879
Just like a Ferris wheel

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:36.960
doesn't stay still forever.

00:12:40.799 --> 00:12:41.679
Why did you hide it from me?

00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:46.080
Because I didn't want to know.

00:12:48.559 --> 00:12:50.000
Because I don't understand why

00:12:50.200 --> 00:12:51.120
you keep dwelling on

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.759
things that don't bring happiness.

00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:02.639
Because, Secretary Lin...

00:13:04.039 --> 00:13:04.840
What?

00:13:05.759 --> 00:13:07.360
Because I've always been thinking,

00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:10.000
if only that person were you.

00:13:12.120 --> 00:13:13.559
Because if it were you,

00:13:14.519 --> 00:13:15.840
our meeting

00:13:16.039 --> 00:13:17.559
would be meant to be.

00:13:18.639 --> 00:13:19.960
And there would be no regrets.
