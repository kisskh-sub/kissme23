00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.700
[Longwan Village, Hanzhou City, 2005]

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:17.760
This is great.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:20.290
Congratulations.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.650
You've finally become a police officer.

00:00:24.070 --> 00:00:25.160
Maybe I can ask my dad

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.420
to talk to Uncle Tianye

00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.120
about lending you some money
to repeat a year of study.

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:29.760
Forget it.

00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:31.510
We're not family.

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:33.390
It's inappropriate to ask for a favor.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.880
How can you say we're not family?

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:36.210
We're all from Longwan.

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:38.600
Centuries ago, we were all related.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:42.790
That's just for your three families,
Wen, Liu, and Qin.

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:44.110
For outsiders like us,

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:46.110
even if you go back
several thousand years,

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:47.350
we still wouldn't be related.

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:49.210
You're being too narrow-minded.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:51.840
If we go back tens of thousands of years,

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.300
we all evolved from primates.

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:54.630
So, we're still family.

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.800
Honestly,

00:00:58.560 --> 00:00:59.920
I don't want to study anymore.

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:01.780
I'm just not cut out for it anyway.

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.960
What will you do then?

00:01:05.310 --> 00:01:05.970
Make money.

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:08.760
Just like Uncle Tianye.

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.070
I heard he had good grades in school,

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.600
but he didn't go to college.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.150
But look at him now.

00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:15.980
He's very successful.

00:01:18.039 --> 00:01:19.900
Are you going to start a business?

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.430
I haven't figured out
exactly what to do,

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:26.070
but I definitely won't spend my whole life
working for someone else.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:27.670
I don't want to be like my dad,

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:29.230
who does the most exhausting work

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.360
with the least money

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:32.360
and is still despised by others.

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.200
Wen Bo.

00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:36.970
One day,

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:39.400
I'll make a name for myself.

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:41.509
I'll be very successful

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:43.240
and prove myself

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:44.880
to my dad and all those

00:01:45.229 --> 00:01:46.350
who look down on me.

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:49.970
I believe in you.

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.000
Really?

00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:55.560
As the saying goes,

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.730
"A father knows his son the best."

00:02:01.280 --> 00:02:02.760
A father?

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.120
A father knows his son the best?

00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:05.150
Whose father?

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:06.840
Whose?

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.270
Your father!

00:02:09.910 --> 00:02:10.430
Stop!

00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:11.080
No!

00:03:21.690 --> 00:03:31.910

[Episode 36]

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:43.970
Any progress on arresting Zhao Peng?

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:45.079
We've confirmed

00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:46.910
that the person who took Zhao Peng away

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:47.960
is Ding Baoshuai.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:51.050
Currently, we're searching for him
in a large scale.

00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.560
Although there might be

00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:57.090
more to the story behind it,

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.430
based on what we know so far,

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:00.360
Zhao Peng

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.090
is likely a key suspect

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.910
and probably even the mastermind.

00:04:03.910 --> 00:04:05.310
That's for sure.

00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.400
I think

00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.400
maybe we should issue
a preliminary announcement

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:10.530
to quiet

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:12.310
the online discussions.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.590
What do you think?

00:04:15.470 --> 00:04:17.470
They've already covered it up once.

00:04:17.829 --> 00:04:19.680
Without conclusive verification,

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.720
it would be reckless
to issue an announcement.

00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:22.510
Otherwise,

00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.040
the people would lost trust
in the government.

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:25.900
Director Peng,

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.600
are there any new leads?

00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:29.600
Not at the moment.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.880
Party Secretary Li,

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.000
there's too much
public and online discourse

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:36.000
right now

00:04:36.159 --> 00:04:37.390
and even more rumors.

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:39.390
I think we should issue an announcement

00:04:39.390 --> 00:04:40.510
as soon as we can

00:04:40.510 --> 00:04:42.170
to completely stop the rumors

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:44.040
so we can proceed with our work.

00:04:44.159 --> 00:04:45.159
What do you think?

00:04:45.159 --> 00:04:46.820
We can issue an announcement.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.100
But Director Peng,

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:50.430
your team cannot slack off
on the investigation.

00:04:50.430 --> 00:04:51.630
Keep digging into it.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:52.680
We must

00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:54.070
get to the bottom of it.

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:54.870
Yes, sir.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.630
Please rest assured.

00:04:58.870 --> 00:05:00.170
The city government just announced

00:05:00.170 --> 00:05:01.920
those responsible
for covering up the accident.

00:05:01.920 --> 00:05:03.340
Liu Yi, Uncle Limin,

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.340
and Peng.

00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:08.480
And they said they'd keep digging.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:09.540

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:11.000

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.190
I did,

00:05:13.950 --> 00:05:15.480
but I couldn't get through.

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:19.000
A bunch of nasty rascals.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:22.490
They're getting serious now.

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.190
I just don't understand.
Why are they passing the buck to us?

00:05:25.190 --> 00:05:26.640
What's in it for them?

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.930
They're treating us like scapegoats.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.290

I'll take care of it right away.

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.400
And you'll make a statement,

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.830
saying that Tianyun has terminated

00:05:40.830 --> 00:05:42.270
its cooperation with Pengfei Construction.

in internal operations.

00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:47.040
What about Chen Shuifa?
Should we reach out to him?

00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.000
Now that he doesn't want
to answer our calls,

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.510
let's knock him out of the game.

00:05:49.510 --> 00:05:51.950
Find some videos
of him taking bribes and doing dirty work

00:05:51.950 --> 00:05:53.150
and post them online.

00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:54.360

This will cause a major stir.

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:01.270
Shouldn't we negotiate with him first?

00:06:01.270 --> 00:06:03.750
Do you think an official like him
would negotiate with you?

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:05.040
Contact Editor-in-Chief Zhang.

00:09:29.750 --> 00:09:31.610
so I had to invite you here to talk.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:33.690
Liu Tianye,

00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.670
what do you think you're doing?

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:35.790
[Video Call] [End]

00:09:35.790 --> 00:09:36.870
Are you insane?

00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:41.410
Hey, there's so much gossip
about the boss.

00:09:41.410 --> 00:09:43.020
If you're willing to share it with me,

00:09:43.020 --> 00:09:44.290
I might feel better.

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:47.940
Are you going to mess with the boss?

00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:48.600
[Video Call] [End]

00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:49.830
Listen, Liu Tianye,

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.240
if you want to die,
don't drag me down with you.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.570
Do you have a death wish?

00:09:56.390 --> 00:09:58.120
Maybe I can help you remember.

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:01.550
Ma Jin did some dirty work
for the boss before,

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:02.670
and he had a notebook

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:04.030
with many numbers written in it.

00:10:04.030 --> 00:10:05.630
Some are probably digital codes

00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:06.440
or

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:07.870
bank accounts.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:09.200
There are about 20 sets.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:11.000
He had kept this notebook with him
until he died,

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:13.460
which means it must've been
his last resort.

00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:14.630
However,

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:16.030
I read

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:17.120
and looked into it.

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.120
[Video Call] [End]

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.180
I heard Mayor Hong likes young girls.

00:10:21.510 --> 00:10:22.910
So, besides Zhang Xin,

00:10:22.910 --> 00:10:24.150
are there other girls?

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.120
What nonsense are you talking about?

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.250
I don't understand.

00:10:27.960 --> 00:10:28.670
Listen,

00:10:29.550 --> 00:10:30.910
I'm a man of principles.

00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:32.470
I never gossip or pry into

00:10:32.470 --> 00:10:34.470
the boss's affairs behind his back.

00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:37.630
Principles?

00:10:39.840 --> 00:10:40.550
Baoshuai.

00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:43.160
Help Director Chen remember.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:47.530
What are you going to do?

00:10:48.080 --> 00:10:48.940
What are you...

00:10:57.480 --> 00:10:58.990
Stop! Stop!

00:10:59.010 --> 00:11:00.480
Please stop!

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:16.600
Mr. Liu!

00:11:20.150 --> 00:11:22.480
Mr. Liu! Mr. Liu! Please don't!

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:24.610
If they keep beating me, I'll die!

00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:26.530
Director Chen,

00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.360
do you remember anything now?

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:30.790
Mr. Liu...

00:11:30.960 --> 00:11:32.150
I-I remember now.

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.790
I-I heard about something.

00:11:34.910 --> 00:11:36.560
I wasn't in charge.

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:38.660
It was all Ms. Zhang.

00:11:40.870 --> 00:11:42.000
What did you hear?

00:11:43.270 --> 00:11:44.320
I heard

00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:45.970
that a few days ago,

00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:47.390
a college girl,

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:50.340
apparently Ms. Zhang's assistant,

00:11:50.870 --> 00:11:51.670
got pregnant.

00:11:52.630 --> 00:11:53.600
It was a boy,

00:11:53.670 --> 00:11:55.480
so the boss really wanted to keep it.

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:56.150
But

00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:57.590
something went wrong,

00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:00.080
and that girl was disobedient.

00:12:00.320 --> 00:12:02.780
Zhang Xin took care of everything
in the end.

00:12:05.270 --> 00:12:06.670
What's that girl's name?

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:07.880
I really don't know.

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:09.260
I only heard about it.

00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:12.200
Well, t-this isn't the first time

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:14.130
something like this has happened.

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:14.840
Anyway,

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:15.910
Zhang Xin

00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:17.440
has been in charge of this.

00:12:17.440 --> 00:12:18.200
I think

00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.100
they had these girls live
in the same neighborhood.

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.910
Were those accounts opened
for these girls?

00:12:27.080 --> 00:12:27.790
Probably.

00:12:28.790 --> 00:12:30.160
I-I heard

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.440
that these years, the boss's

00:12:33.030 --> 00:12:34.160
overseas accounts,

00:12:34.390 --> 00:12:35.960
offshore accounts and the like,

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.870
are all held by these girls.

00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:40.440
And they've already obtained

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:42.220
foreign citizenship.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:43.990
Zhang Xin has managed it all.

00:12:44.750 --> 00:12:46.080
Mr. Liu, how about this?

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:46.840
Mr. Liu,

00:12:47.030 --> 00:12:48.130
if y-you

00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.270
have any plans,

00:12:49.750 --> 00:12:51.480
we can sit down and talk calmly.

00:12:51.630 --> 00:12:53.270
There's no need to flip the table.

00:12:53.270 --> 00:12:53.910
Besides,

00:12:54.630 --> 00:12:56.390
if you go against the boss,

00:12:57.510 --> 00:12:58.790
you won't end up well.

00:13:03.060 --> 00:13:03.340
[Select]

00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.240
[Disconnected]

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:04.750
Mr. Liu?

00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:05.670
Mr. Liu!

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:13.170
Don't hit me! Please don't!

00:13:13.870 --> 00:13:15.330
I've told you everything!

00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:20.460
Look into this matter.

00:13:20.670 --> 00:13:22.270
Hanzhou is just a small city.

00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.170
Find that neighborhood

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:25.550
and that girl.

00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:14.160
The City Economic Forum is approaching.

00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:18.200
All the major leaders in the province
will attend it.

00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:20.260
These past few days have been so busy.

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:21.630
These years,

00:14:22.280 --> 00:14:24.200
Hanzhou's economic growth

00:14:24.790 --> 00:14:27.120
has been the frontrunner in the province.

00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.000
That's why the higher-ups
specifically requested

00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.130
that I give a speech.

00:14:31.240 --> 00:14:31.840
Look.

00:14:33.030 --> 00:14:34.020
Director Chen

00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:37.150
was supposed to draft and polish it.

00:14:37.390 --> 00:14:38.030
But now,

00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.880
I have to write it myself.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:42.380
By the way,

00:14:43.670 --> 00:14:44.870
how's Director Chen?

00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:45.640
Is he okay?

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.970
He might feel a bit frustrated.

00:14:49.080 --> 00:14:50.010
But don't worry.

00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:50.960
I always

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:52.170
consider the dog's master

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:53.230
before hitting it.

00:14:59.000 --> 00:14:59.660
Have a seat.

00:15:02.510 --> 00:15:04.360
It's rare that no one else is here.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:05.620
It's just the two of us,

00:15:05.670 --> 00:15:07.130
sitting here face to face.

00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:19.970
The task force's operation
has really tightened up these days.

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:23.600
If you want a mutually destructive fight,

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:28.200
you'll be the first to fall.

00:15:31.880 --> 00:15:33.740
Sir, I'm well aware of your power,

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:34.620
but

00:15:34.910 --> 00:15:36.170
where the fire spreads

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:38.580
depends on which way the wind blows.

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:43.620
You and Zhang Xin

00:15:43.900 --> 00:15:44.900
are so close,

00:15:46.110 --> 00:15:47.520
so why don't you persuade her

00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:48.520
to leave Hanzhou?

00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:50.270
You can do

00:15:50.750 --> 00:15:51.880
business anywhere.

00:15:52.970 --> 00:15:56.030
Longwan has come this far
from a small fishing village,

00:15:56.480 --> 00:15:58.610
so we won't be anyone's pawns anymore.

00:16:00.070 --> 00:16:01.150
We will

00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:03.230
play the game on our own.

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:17.720
Who isn't a pawn?

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:19.050
Play the game yourself?

00:16:20.890 --> 00:16:22.990
Even if you make it to my position,

00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:25.920
neither of us will be the players,
understand?

00:16:27.830 --> 00:16:30.670
You're just used by others.

00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:34.270
A person's social nature,
or be it destiny,

00:16:34.790 --> 00:16:36.440
is predetermined,

00:16:38.630 --> 00:16:41.240
You can only stay where you belong.

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:44.670
Whether in politics or business,

00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.080
no one can escape human nature.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.600
Honestly, I'm an atheist.

00:16:54.870 --> 00:16:57.240
But I still meditate and pray to Buddha

00:16:58.120 --> 00:17:00.270
just to find peace

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:03.790
and where I truly belong.

00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.240
If a person is too greedy,

00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.310
they'll only be consumed
by their own sins.

00:17:14.750 --> 00:17:16.680
So, here's a piece of advice, Liu.

00:17:19.190 --> 00:17:21.800
Don't let humans' weaknesses ruin you.

00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:30.100
When it comes to greed and sins,

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.600
I'm nowhere near your level.

00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:24.920
Find Chen Shuifa.

00:18:25.600 --> 00:18:26.310
Okay.

00:18:42.310 --> 00:18:43.750
It's Tianfei's club.

00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:46.590
Let's go in and take a look, okay?

00:18:46.640 --> 00:18:47.480
I'll go in,

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.610
and you'll block them at the back door.

00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.490
There are plainclothes officers.

00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:56.330
Oh, your eyes are sharp.

00:18:58.550 --> 00:18:59.750
Did you arrange this?

00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:01.110
We'll kill two birds with one stone.

00:19:01.110 --> 00:19:02.310
Wait at the back door.

00:19:17.440 --> 00:19:18.030
Tianfei.

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:18.880
Tianfei.

00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:19.930
You're here.

00:19:21.270 --> 00:19:23.070
Have you been to Baoshuai's place
these days?

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:24.160
We're planning to go there tomorrow

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:25.560
to bring them some stuff.

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:28.830
Head to the bank first.

00:19:28.830 --> 00:19:30.690
Drive the car out and hide it well.

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:32.030
Tianye might move them

00:19:32.030 --> 00:19:32.960
to another location soon.

00:19:32.960 --> 00:19:33.550
Okay.

00:19:34.550 --> 00:19:36.200
Let's thank Mr. Qin Feng

00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.000
for his generous support for our club!

00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.200
Have fun and enjoy

00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.400
the wonderful night!

00:19:53.800 --> 00:19:54.980
Use the back door.

00:19:55.450 --> 00:19:56.790
Hide yourselves for a couple of days.

00:19:56.790 --> 00:19:58.190
Don't let anyone see you.

00:19:58.480 --> 00:19:59.110
Okay.

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:50.430
Isn't this Feng, my bro?

00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:53.690
I didn't expect you to have time
to come to my club.
