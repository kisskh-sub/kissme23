A long, long time ago,

in a remote village,

00:00:18.830 --> 00:00:21.160
lived a brave knight.

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:23.550
His name was Arthur.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:25.000
Though not famous,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.480
he possessed a kind and righteous heart.

00:00:30.830 --> 00:00:31.760

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:34.640
to the roofs of the nearby town,

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.370
letting out terrifying roars,

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.200
frightening all the residents
from leaving their homes.

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.000
People were at a loss,

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:43.260
with no way to fight against this dragon.

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:44.280
Daddy,

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.470
is this dragon very powerful?

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:47.390
Very powerful.

00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:49.990

who won't sleep.

We'll sleep after we finish reading.

Upon hearing this news,

00:00:55.960 --> 00:00:58.560
Arthur immediately
mounted his loyal warhorse

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:01.070
and set off for the town.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.120
He saw the dragon breathing flames,

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:07.850
ready to attack the residents.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:10.480
Arthur charged toward the dragon
without hesitation,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:11.870
brandishing the sword in his hand,

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:13.840
and began a fierce battle.

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:16.920
Finally, he found the dragon's weak spot.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.510
Look.

00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:19.610
He thrust his sword into its heart.

00:01:19.789 --> 00:01:22.120
The dragon let out its final roar

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.039
and never rose again.

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.400
From then on,

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:28.590
Arthur became the town's guardian knight.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:30.710
Whenever someone needed help,

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.370

without hesitation.

It's still not too late to turn back now.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:56.510
I believe if Jiangyong were still alive,

00:12:57.410 --> 00:12:58.940
he would say the same thing.

00:13:01.730 --> 00:13:03.460
I understand, Sister-in-law.

00:13:03.890 --> 00:13:05.350
Good that you understand.

00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:07.080
Then I'll be going now.

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.200
Here.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.020
How beautiful it is.

00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.750
It's been a long time

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:23.360
since I stood here to enjoy Longwan.

00:13:23.360 --> 00:13:25.160
I haven't been here much either.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.110
Well,

00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:28.080
in the past, I never thought much of it—

00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:29.960
climbing the mountain was nothing.

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.160
Why do I feel tired just climbing up now?

00:13:32.630 --> 00:13:34.560
Not just you. I'm out of breath too.

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:37.550
I'm old.

00:13:38.910 --> 00:13:40.390
Before, I was just busy.

00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:42.120
Lots of people at home.

00:13:42.750 --> 00:13:44.600
Later, you all

00:13:44.600 --> 00:13:46.750
weren't home much,
and I had more free time.

00:13:46.750 --> 00:13:49.600
After having more free time,
I really felt myself aging.

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:50.560
No.

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:52.040
You're not old at all.

00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:53.760
Mom, now is the prime time—

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:56.360
just the right time
to go out and have fun, right?

00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:58.000
Just tell me where you'd like to go.

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.460
I'll arrange everything.

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:00.580
That sounds good.

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:04.390
Feng,

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:07.150
now that you've resigned,

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:09.240
come back home to live.

00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.590
Look at you outside.

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.840
You can't eat or drink well,
just getting by every day.

00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:16.030
If you come home, at least

00:14:16.030 --> 00:14:18.150
you'll have hot meals to eat.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:19.600
Mom,

00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.530
I'm a grown-up now. I won't starve.

00:14:22.240 --> 00:14:23.770
Besides, after resigning,

00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:25.890
there's still a lot to take care of.

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:28.500
Coming home every day isn't convenient.

00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.440
Alright.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.440
You have been kind-hearted

00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:37.960
since you were little.

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:40.840
You always think of others

00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:43.510
and keep a lot of things in your heart,

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:45.100
never speaking about them.

00:14:46.390 --> 00:14:49.050
And you always tell me good news,
never bad news.

00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:50.550
I know

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:52.720
you don't want me to be worried.

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:54.670
But

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:57.350
ever since you became a police officer,

00:14:57.480 --> 00:15:00.150
I've felt you've suffered.

00:15:00.990 --> 00:15:02.630
And I can't take care of you.

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.030
I feel very guilty toward you.

00:15:05.490 --> 00:15:06.250
Mom,

00:15:06.790 --> 00:15:08.390
please don't think that way.

00:15:08.510 --> 00:15:10.110
Don't feel guilty toward me.

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:12.640
Where did that thought even come from?

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:16.810
After what happened back then,

00:15:17.670 --> 00:15:19.600
I raised the three of you by myself.

00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:21.550
I was so confident.

00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.960
I believed I could raise you well.

00:15:24.670 --> 00:15:26.360
I could educate you well

00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:28.150
and raise you to be

00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.860
well-behaved, high-achieving people.

00:15:33.590 --> 00:15:34.740
I never expected...

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:37.160
I really never expected...

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.450
I was wrong.

00:15:40.210 --> 00:15:41.940
I didn't educate him properly.

00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:48.790
Feng.

00:15:50.820 --> 00:15:53.360
Today I just want to tell you one thing.

00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:56.740
No matter what happens in the future,

00:15:57.790 --> 00:15:59.360
whatever you'll do,

00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.910
I'll always stand on the side of justice.

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:03.390
I'll always be behind you.

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:07.790
Mom.

00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.440
Hearing you say that

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:13.940
makes me feel so much more at ease.

00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:19.940
Don't think about these unpleasant things.

00:16:21.030 --> 00:16:21.890
Enjoy the scenery.

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:22.840
So beautiful.

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:24.240
Yes.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:26.550
Longwan is truly beautiful.

00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.190
Feng is determined to resign this time.

00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:59.920
Looks like
he's not leaving himself a way out.

00:17:00.010 --> 00:17:01.750
He's been stubborn since he was a kid.

00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:02.410
Otherwise,

00:17:02.430 --> 00:17:04.089
why would they call him Crazy?

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.880
Crazy.

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:09.010
I think he will never stop

00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:10.829
until he arrests...

00:17:10.829 --> 00:17:11.640
all...

00:17:11.660 --> 00:17:12.420
of...

00:17:12.599 --> 00:17:13.490
us.

00:17:31.490 --> 00:17:33.890
I've never
seen you drink this much before.

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:40.990
Today,

00:17:41.150 --> 00:17:43.200
you visited Mrs. Wen and Bo?

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:46.200
Just passing by.

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:56.910
Thank you

00:17:58.980 --> 00:18:00.840
for what you've done these years.

00:18:04.990 --> 00:18:06.750
We all know how you've treated

00:18:08.480 --> 00:18:09.750
Mrs. Wen and Bo.

00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:15.370
How about this?

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:16.880
The wine on the shelf—

00:18:17.090 --> 00:18:18.170
drink as you like.

00:18:19.310 --> 00:18:21.510
Drink as much as you want. I'll join you.

00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.220
But only for today.

00:18:27.110 --> 00:18:28.830
Tomorrow, all this must be put behind us.

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:30.050
Things will go back to how they were.

00:18:30.050 --> 00:18:30.730
Okay?

00:18:32.030 --> 00:18:33.360
How were things before?

00:18:34.920 --> 00:18:36.650
I don't know how things will be.

00:18:38.590 --> 00:18:39.720
But I know clearly

00:18:40.990 --> 00:18:42.190
some words...

00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.720
can never be spoken.

00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:51.440
Uncle Tianye,

00:18:51.440 --> 00:18:52.500
Uncle Feng is here.

00:18:57.110 --> 00:18:57.960
Tianfei.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:00.470
Take Taoyi

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:02.770
back inside to drink first.

00:19:05.240 --> 00:19:09.840
[Hanzhou Club]

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.020
Keep an eye on them.

00:19:16.510 --> 00:19:17.110
Taoyi.

00:19:19.110 --> 00:19:19.700
Let's go.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:42.480
I heard

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:43.680
you resigned.

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:48.310
I've quitted.

00:19:48.890 --> 00:19:50.090
I can't do it anymore.

00:19:52.830 --> 00:19:53.680
Why?

00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:56.640
It's too difficult.

00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.780
I can't continue anymore.

00:20:01.110 --> 00:20:02.570
I'm worried if I continue,

00:20:04.250 --> 00:20:05.850
one day when I'm on a mission,

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:08.980
I might end up killed by my own people.

00:20:10.010 --> 00:20:11.140
Better save my life.

00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:13.770
Someone set you up?

00:20:14.350 --> 00:20:15.210
You don't know?

00:20:19.850 --> 00:20:21.250
I heard a little about it.

00:20:22.440 --> 00:20:23.530
I knew it.

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:27.160
You didn't come to me today

00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:28.400
to drink, right?

00:20:30.650 --> 00:20:31.330
Tianye.

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:35.510
I want to work with you.

00:20:39.270 --> 00:20:40.030
How?

00:20:40.310 --> 00:20:41.030
Indeed,

00:20:41.030 --> 00:20:42.830
in the past, I did a lot of things.

00:20:45.030 --> 00:20:46.530
And I made you hate me.

00:20:47.350 --> 00:20:48.750
But there was no other way.

00:20:48.750 --> 00:20:49.880
As a police officer,

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:52.350
I carried responsibility on my shoulders.

00:20:52.350 --> 00:20:53.680
But now it's different.

00:20:54.270 --> 00:20:55.290
I've resigned.

00:20:56.160 --> 00:20:58.020
I'm just an ordinary citizen now.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.830
There are not that many rules

00:20:59.830 --> 00:21:01.690
or regulations constraining me.

00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.690
Now I follow my heart.

00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:10.330
Personal grudges.

00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:14.920
I know who your enemy is.

00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.540
He's my enemy too.

00:21:18.920 --> 00:21:21.530
So... the enemy of my enemy is my friend,

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:22.440
right?

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:24.000
Besides, we're brothers.

00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:42.870
Do you think...

00:21:43.640 --> 00:21:45.160
I would believe you?

00:21:46.550 --> 00:21:48.880
It doesn't matter
if you believe me or not.

00:21:49.030 --> 00:21:51.030
Our goals are the same anyway.

00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:53.580
Shared interests

00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:56.330
are much more reliable than trust.

00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:01.500
You just said

00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:03.680
my enemy is your enemy.

00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:05.720
So who is

00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:06.510
my enemy?

00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.010
Isn't it your backer?

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.020
You don't need to answer me today.

00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.120
Whether you agree or not,

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.640
I'll do it anyway.

00:22:26.030 --> 00:22:27.290
On the path of revenge,

00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:29.060
I'll run into you eventually.

00:22:30.490 --> 00:22:31.490
See you next time.

00:23:58.350 --> 00:24:00.550
How have things been in Longwan lately?

00:24:01.400 --> 00:24:03.660
Have you managed to get anything useful?

00:24:04.110 --> 00:24:05.200
They won't even let me

00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.200
anywhere near anything important.

00:24:08.350 --> 00:24:10.410
I'm basically wasting my life there.

00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.680
To put it bluntly—

00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:15.680
I'm living with less freedom

00:24:15.680 --> 00:24:17.750
than the horses in your stable.

00:24:20.390 --> 00:24:22.800
You know what's been going on lately.

00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.930
If you don't want to be implicated,

00:24:27.060 --> 00:24:28.860
you need to take the initiative.

00:24:30.510 --> 00:24:31.840
What do you need me to do?

00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:47.170
Plug this into Wen Jiangyan's computer.

00:24:47.350 --> 00:24:49.480
You don't need to worry about the rest.

00:24:53.270 --> 00:24:54.020
Ms. Zhang,

00:24:54.910 --> 00:24:56.770
what exactly are you trying to do?

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.110
I want to know the password

00:24:58.110 --> 00:25:00.870
to the back-end financial system
of Longwan Logistics.

00:25:00.870 --> 00:25:02.730
A few payments will come in later.

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:06.850
Then help me find the company seal
and stamp this contract.

00:25:07.270 --> 00:25:09.030
Then the job is done.

00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:12.510
This is the company

I used to keep accounts before, right?

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:18.790
That's exactly why I had you use it

00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:21.860
for accounts keeping and money laundering.

00:25:22.270 --> 00:25:22.930
Otherwise,

00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:27.270
you'd be making money
without lifting a finger.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:31.880
This is against Liu Tianye, right?

00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:34.880
It won't affect Jiangyan, right?

00:25:36.680 --> 00:25:38.930
That depends on what Liu Tianye will do.

00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:42.310
Do you really have the luxury
to worry about that now?

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:43.370
If he doesn't fall,

you will.

I'll give you the opportunity you want.

Otherwise,

00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.480

that all the bad things
you're doing for Zhang Xin now

I've become like this

00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.400

everyone in Longwan has looked down on me.

00:29:39.030 --> 00:29:41.240
They called me an outsider
and a live-in son-in-law,

00:29:41.240 --> 00:29:42.700
especially your brother!

00:29:43.240 --> 00:29:44.400
He has never treated me

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:45.750
as his own family.

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:48.720
He's always guarded against me
and suppressed me.

Working under your brother,

00:29:50.070 --> 00:29:51.790
I was always extremely careful.

00:29:51.790 --> 00:29:54.000
I did what I should
and even what I shouldn't!

00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:55.440
And I still got no appreciation!

00:29:55.440 --> 00:29:57.720
And every day,
I have to live by your brother's mood!

00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:58.830
Why should I?

00:30:01.510 --> 00:30:02.440
I'm a person.

00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:05.240
I'm not a nanny
your brother orders around!

00:30:06.350 --> 00:30:07.350
Back then, for your sake,

00:30:07.350 --> 00:30:10.080
I quitted my job
and came to Longwan to be with you.

00:30:10.460 --> 00:30:11.720
Yes, that was nothing.

00:30:12.110 --> 00:30:13.640
Later, your brother
had me marry into your family

00:30:13.640 --> 00:30:17.100
and become a live-in son-in-law.
I put up with that for you too.

00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.850
What I can't stand most is

00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:20.550
even my own child

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:21.960
couldn't have my surname.

Why? She's my daughter!

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:27.210

00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.720
I have dignity too.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.790
I want to have my own career.

00:30:36.590 --> 00:30:39.310
I want everyone in Longwan to respect me!

00:30:39.310 --> 00:30:40.600
Am I wrong?

00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:42.000

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:44.830
You're crazy.

everything.

00:31:58.960 --> 00:32:01.160
Xu Jiajun has been lying to me all along.

00:32:03.110 --> 00:32:04.400
To make money,

00:32:06.270 --> 00:32:07.790
for his own desires,

00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.830
he worked with Zhang Xin.

00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:15.590
But the business dealings
they've engaged in

00:32:15.590 --> 00:32:16.920
are illegal.

00:32:17.920 --> 00:32:20.160
It's a trap Zhang Xin set for him,

00:32:21.790 --> 00:32:23.440
just to use him...

00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.310
to drag Longwan down.

00:32:29.790 --> 00:32:31.270
They did that

00:32:32.830 --> 00:32:34.750
to go after Tianye, right?

00:32:38.590 --> 00:32:39.790
These past few years,

00:32:40.750 --> 00:32:43.240
Tianye has been competing
with them for business.

00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:44.590
Now they've fallen out,

00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.140
so they're starting to make their moves.

00:32:51.550 --> 00:32:53.510
I knew something was wrong before.

00:32:54.550 --> 00:32:56.110
But I never thought...

00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.960
he'd get in so deep.

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:04.550
Mom.

00:33:07.310 --> 00:33:09.640
Xu Jiajun is beyond saving.

00:33:16.590 --> 00:33:17.310
Jiangyan,

00:33:18.350 --> 00:33:19.680
divorce him.

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:22.030
After the divorce,

00:33:22.750 --> 00:33:23.350
you

00:33:23.350 --> 00:33:24.070
and Baobao

00:33:24.070 --> 00:33:25.720
can live with me.

00:33:27.750 --> 00:33:28.920
With me here,

00:33:29.270 --> 00:33:31.070
you don't need to fear anything.

00:33:36.390 --> 00:33:37.110
Mom.

00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:39.720
I'm sorry.

00:33:42.990 --> 00:33:44.990
I've been keeping so many things...

00:33:46.010 --> 00:33:47.420
from you.

00:33:48.750 --> 00:33:51.280
I thought
as long as Tianye wasn't in Longwan,

00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:54.050
many problems would stay away from us.

00:33:55.350 --> 00:33:57.720
But I still failed to protect this family.

00:33:59.400 --> 00:34:01.030
Mom, I'm sorry.

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:04.790
You don't need to apologize to me.

00:34:05.590 --> 00:34:08.320
I know what you've sacrificed
for this family.

00:34:08.760 --> 00:34:11.420
I know how hard it's been for you
all these years.

00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:13.880
Actually,

00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.400
the one who you truly should apologize to
is yourself, child.

00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.190
No matter what happens in the future,

00:34:20.190 --> 00:34:22.199
remember to be good to yourself.

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:36.230
Good girl.

00:34:42.590 --> 00:34:44.190
Alright, don't cry anymore.

00:34:53.070 --> 00:34:53.880
You...

00:34:54.190 --> 00:34:55.190
really resigned?

00:34:55.780 --> 00:34:56.699
I quitted.

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:02.110
You're not here
to work undercover, are you?

00:35:02.110 --> 00:35:02.920
At your place?

00:35:04.510 --> 00:35:05.280
Just look around.

00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:07.480
Turn around
and see what's worth spying on here.

00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:08.340
The engine oil?

00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:09.150
Well,

00:35:09.230 --> 00:35:09.750
Feng,

00:35:09.880 --> 00:35:11.500
I really don't understand.

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:13.550
How did you end up driving too?

00:35:13.630 --> 00:35:14.560
Mai, you guys...

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:17.400
Is this some kind of tradition
in your section? All like this?

00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:18.230
Get lost.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.630
Don't butt in.

00:35:21.630 --> 00:35:22.400
Crazy.

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:25.330
Your name "Feng"

00:35:25.710 --> 00:35:27.150
means maple leaves.

00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:29.400
It doesn't mean madman.

00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.630
If Ye finds out you quitted,
he'll beat you.

00:35:32.630 --> 00:35:33.960
Why would he beat me?

00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.130
I came to work for you.
If anyone gets beaten, it'd be you.

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:39.110
He should beat you for resigning.

00:35:39.110 --> 00:35:40.030
Why would he beat me?

00:35:40.030 --> 00:35:41.920
Isn't beating you a habit of his?

00:35:45.710 --> 00:35:46.630
Fine then.

00:35:47.070 --> 00:35:48.470
I'll find you a car later.

00:35:48.510 --> 00:35:50.590
And after the paperwork's done,
you start driving first.

00:35:50.590 --> 00:35:51.280
Okay?

00:35:51.510 --> 00:35:52.230
No need.

00:35:53.190 --> 00:35:54.450
Forget about driving.

00:35:54.510 --> 00:35:55.960
I'm here to assist you.

00:35:56.150 --> 00:35:57.550
From now on, in this shop,

00:35:58.110 --> 00:35:59.040
you're the boss.

00:35:59.150 --> 00:36:00.000
I'm second-in-command.

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.230
I'll just be a project manager,

00:36:01.230 --> 00:36:02.400
in charge of personnel management.

00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:03.630
I won't handle anything else.

00:36:03.630 --> 00:36:05.280
So I've found myself a master to serve?

00:36:05.280 --> 00:36:07.010
I'm just cooperating with you.

00:36:09.110 --> 00:36:09.670
Alright.

00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:13.030
Come here, everyone.

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:14.840
Guys, come over here!

00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:16.040
Come, gather around.

00:36:17.550 --> 00:36:19.210
I have something to announce.

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:21.400
Feng, you all know him. Right?

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.230
-Yes.
-Yes.

00:36:22.550 --> 00:36:24.000
He'll be working here from now on.

00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.110
He'll be the manager,

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:26.230
in charge of managing you all.

00:36:26.230 --> 00:36:27.030
No problem, right?

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:27.960
-No problem.
-No problem.

00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:29.360
If there's no problem, say hello.

00:36:29.360 --> 00:36:30.670
-Hello, Brother Feng.
-Hello, Brother Feng.

00:36:30.670 --> 00:36:31.730
Alright. Alright.

00:36:31.840 --> 00:36:34.070
Listen, calling me Brother has its perks.

00:36:34.070 --> 00:36:35.400
According to...

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:37.310
the unwritten rules,

00:36:37.630 --> 00:36:39.400
everyone gets an extra month's pay.

00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:40.460
-Really?
-Really?

00:36:40.550 --> 00:36:41.440
Are you paying?

00:36:41.630 --> 00:36:42.760
You're paying. You're the boss.

00:36:42.760 --> 00:36:43.550
Why should I pay?

00:36:43.550 --> 00:36:44.630
Mai, triple for me.

00:36:44.630 --> 00:36:45.560
Get back to work.

Got it.

Don't worry.

00:36:59.570 --> 00:37:00.260
Mai.

Turn off the music!

00:37:13.250 --> 00:37:14.250
Who's this?

00:37:17.190 --> 00:37:18.150
Feng.

00:37:18.630 --> 00:37:19.830
What brings you here?

00:37:21.320 --> 00:37:22.180
Everyone, out.

00:37:24.070 --> 00:37:24.920
Feng.

00:37:26.110 --> 00:37:28.030
I finally managed
to come out with my friends today.

00:37:28.030 --> 00:37:29.480
What's this about? Do me a favor.

00:37:29.480 --> 00:37:31.940
I am doing you a favor
by asking them to leave.

00:37:33.400 --> 00:37:34.440
Well...

00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:36.150
guys, ladies,

00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:38.190
they need to discuss some family matters.

00:37:38.190 --> 00:37:40.510
Please step out for a moment.

00:37:40.630 --> 00:37:41.280
Okay?

00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:42.400
At the door. At the door.

00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:43.670
At the door. At the door.

00:37:43.670 --> 00:37:44.800
Step outside for a bit.

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:45.550
Come.

00:37:46.030 --> 00:37:46.840
Thank you.

Yes, at the door. At the door.

Take care. Take care.

Um...

it's about Jiangyan, right?

00:37:54.590 --> 00:37:55.800
We're fine.

00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:56.960
It was...

00:37:57.190 --> 00:37:58.360
a misunderstanding.

00:37:58.360 --> 00:37:59.590
A tiff

00:38:00.150 --> 00:38:02.150
between lovers is soon mended.

00:38:02.150 --> 00:38:04.230
We'll be fine in a couple of days, really.

00:38:04.230 --> 00:38:04.960
How about...

00:38:05.230 --> 00:38:06.000

Put your hand in here.

Put it in.

This...

00:38:25.320 --> 00:38:25.840
It hurts! It hurts!

00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:26.960
I told you before!

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:28.890
Don't touch my sister!

00:38:29.190 --> 00:38:30.510
That's enough!

00:38:30.920 --> 00:38:32.800
Zhang Xin forced me to do it!

00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:39.940
You acted pretty quickly.

00:38:40.190 --> 00:38:42.320
Give him to me. I'll loosen his joints.

00:38:43.660 --> 00:38:44.480
Too late.

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:47.710
I'll send him to the bureau
for further discipline.

00:38:47.710 --> 00:38:49.440
They've already
laid their hands on our sister.

00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:50.640
You decide what to do.

Lend me a car.

00:38:54.290 --> 00:38:56.490
This looks like a wedding celebration.

00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.510
Alright, my little master.

00:39:06.070 --> 00:39:08.400
Your family matter has been taken care of.

00:39:09.150 --> 00:39:11.210
What do you plan to investigate next?

00:39:20.150 --> 00:39:22.280
The lead went cold with Ding Baoshuai.

00:39:24.230 --> 00:39:25.710
We can't find Ding Baoshuai.

00:39:25.710 --> 00:39:27.110
His subordinate Zheng Gao—

00:39:27.110 --> 00:39:28.400
can we find him?

00:39:29.690 --> 00:39:32.220
Such a disloyal servant
shouldn't be hard to find.

00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:32.970
Wait.

Ding Baoshuai's right-hand man.

00:39:54.110 --> 00:39:56.790
Ding Baoshuai ran away recently.

00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.030
He doesn't have a boss anymore,

00:39:58.030 --> 00:40:00.160
so he's been messing around on his own.

00:40:00.360 --> 00:40:01.110
Mai,

00:40:01.110 --> 00:40:03.190
I heard this guy
has even started dealing drugs.

00:40:03.190 --> 00:40:04.110
Really?

00:40:05.450 --> 00:40:07.840
Do you know
where he delivers his products?

00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:11.400
Around... the BBQ street, I think.

00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:13.730
They always hang around there.

00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:14.920
Alright, I got it.

00:40:17.070 --> 00:40:18.230
The BBQ street.

00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:24.690
I'd better not show up for this guy.

00:40:25.360 --> 00:40:26.360
If I appear,

00:40:26.800 --> 00:40:28.730
he definitely won't say anything.

00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:29.550
You ask him.

00:40:29.920 --> 00:40:30.630
No problem.

Courtesy before force.

00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.100

00:42:03.590 --> 00:42:05.510
so let's not play dumb.

00:42:05.510 --> 00:42:06.510
Just tell me.

00:42:06.630 --> 00:42:08.030
Who says we're brothers?

00:42:08.760 --> 00:42:09.920
You're hilarious.

00:42:11.030 --> 00:42:12.280
Come on. Cheers. Cheers.

00:42:12.280 --> 00:42:13.400
Wait. Wait. Wait.

00:42:15.480 --> 00:42:17.800
I'm being nice and reasonable with you.

00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.670
Don't push your luck.

00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:27.860
Come on. Come on.

00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:29.520
Fine, I'm staying out of this.

00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.420
This isn't about you guys!

00:42:32.550 --> 00:42:34.000
-Mr. Zheng!
-Sit down, everyone!

00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000
Feng! Feng!

00:42:38.030 --> 00:42:39.320
Where is Ding Baoshuai?

00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:41.720
I really don't know
where Ding Baoshuai is,

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:44.030
but I know Ba and Chen

00:42:44.150 --> 00:42:45.630
often go to the nightclub.

00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:48.030
They must be there
to pass messages to Ding Baoshuai.

00:42:48.030 --> 00:42:49.150
Go to Liu Tianfei.

00:42:54.670 --> 00:42:55.440
What's this?

00:42:56.030 --> 00:42:57.880
It was just brought back from abroad.

00:42:57.880 --> 00:42:59.140
It can't be monitored.

00:42:59.190 --> 00:43:01.520
Use this
to contact each other from now on.

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:09.670
Anyway,

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:10.840
Qin Feng

00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:13.370
has already left the police force.

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:14.480
The case

00:43:14.880 --> 00:43:15.960
can be closed now.

00:43:16.590 --> 00:43:18.190
But I still suspect

00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:21.220
that the information leaked by Zhao Peng

00:43:21.550 --> 00:43:22.590
isn't just...

00:43:23.360 --> 00:43:25.840
isn't just what Qin Feng reported.

00:43:26.230 --> 00:43:28.760
And the task force
probably already has it.

00:43:29.590 --> 00:43:30.650
Just Qin Feng alone

00:43:30.710 --> 00:43:32.800
shouldn't be able to stir up much trouble.

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:33.710
So,

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.480
as long as the task force
doesn't stop investigating,

00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:38.280
I'm afraid...

00:43:39.630 --> 00:43:41.630
the fire won't be put out, Director.

00:43:42.110 --> 00:43:42.970
Director Peng,

00:43:43.070 --> 00:43:44.930
we can't think that far ahead now.

00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:48.170
We need
to proactively share the boss's worries.

00:43:51.710 --> 00:43:52.320
After

00:43:53.030 --> 00:43:54.490
a thorough investigation,

00:43:54.490 --> 00:43:55.820
so far, we've confirmed

00:43:55.880 --> 00:43:57.410
that the accident resulted

00:43:57.590 --> 00:43:58.790
in a total of 3 deaths.

00:43:59.550 --> 00:44:01.400
Based on the confessions
of the co-suspects,

00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:02.280
it was Zhao Peng

00:44:02.760 --> 00:44:04.510
who instructed and coerced a doctor

00:44:04.510 --> 00:44:05.110
to issue

00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:07.510
a false accidental death certificate.

00:44:07.510 --> 00:44:08.370
Additionally,

00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:11.070
Director Qin Limin has confessed

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:11.630
that

00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:13.630
Zhao Peng colluded with Liu Yi

00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:15.880
to force him to conceal the truth.
