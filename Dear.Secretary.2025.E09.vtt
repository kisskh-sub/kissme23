WEBVTT

00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.159
Severe concussion

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:24.760
That serious?

00:01:25.359 --> 00:01:25.959
President Qin

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.840
I'm here to pick up the resumes from earlier.

00:01:27.840 --> 00:01:28.400
Secretary Xue

00:01:29.079 --> 00:01:29.640
What's wrong?

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:31.319
Yes.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:33.599
The doctor said I need a week of rest.

00:01:34.519 --> 00:01:35.319
A week.

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:36.959
Three days is fine too.

00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:40.640
Three days.

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.159
Even one day is okay.

00:01:42.159 --> 00:01:43.200
That's the minimum.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:45.760
So I'd like to request to rest at home.

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:46.799
Alright.

00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.120
I understand.

00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.359
Ugh. (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:54.319 --> 00:01:56.959
The General Manager who commanded the wind and rain three years ago...

00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.400
Has now fallen to the point...

00:01:58.400 --> 00:01:59.599
Of having to grovel...

00:01:59.599 --> 00:02:01.079
To ask for sick leave. Pitiful, lamentable, pathetic.

00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.920
Pitiful, lamentable, pathetic.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.439
If I were you...

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:08.919
I'd pity myself first.

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:10.919
It's ten in the morning.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.719
You're skipping work under the guise of a business trip.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:15.000
I've already reported it to your direct supervisor.

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.759
He said he'll deal with it in ten minutes.

00:02:18.639 --> 00:02:19.400
Which is now.

00:02:19.879 --> 00:02:21.400
Xiao Lin, you...

00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:23.719
Are you even human?

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:25.080
You were wandering and destitute...

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:26.000
Homeless and displaced.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.039
Who took you in?

00:02:27.759 --> 00:02:29.240
How can you kick someone when they're down?

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:30.800
I...

00:02:32.319 --> 00:02:32.919
Move out!

00:02:32.919 --> 00:02:33.680
Move out right now!

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:35.599
Hey, bro...

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:37.280
I'm in the elevator.

00:02:37.719 --> 00:02:38.520
Yeah, right.

00:02:38.879 --> 00:02:39.520
In the elevator.

00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:40.759
Be right there.

00:02:40.759 --> 00:02:41.360
Okay.

00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:43.280
Okay.

00:02:48.159 --> 00:02:50.840
Now I can finally rest.

00:03:08.759 --> 00:03:09.759
I always feel...

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.159
We have an unfinished story.

00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:23.120
Meili.

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.800
Wait here for Mommy, okay?

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:25.759
Don't go anywhere.

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.800
Remember...

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:29.080
Don't go with anyone who tries to take you.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:29.960
Do you hear me?

00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:31.479
I'll be right back.

00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:32.319
Okay.

00:03:39.719 --> 00:03:40.680
Mommy.

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:42.879
Mommy.

00:03:44.360 --> 00:03:45.319
Mommy.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.199
Mommy.

00:03:48.039 --> 00:03:49.759
Mommy, where are you?

00:03:50.199 --> 00:03:51.319
Mommy.

00:03:51.319 --> 00:03:52.360
Where are you?

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.719
Mommy.

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:57.039
Mommy.

00:03:59.719 --> 00:04:00.919
Mommy.

00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:03.039
Mommy.

00:04:03.039 --> 00:04:03.879
Don't cry.

00:04:03.879 --> 00:04:05.000
This is for you.

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:15.240
Thank you.

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.720
You're welcome.

00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:14.319
Secretary Lin isn't here.

00:05:14.399 --> 00:05:16.279
My only motivation for coming to work is gone.

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:18.519
Qin Xue.

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:19.759
Do you know...

00:05:19.759 --> 00:05:20.959
What's really wrong with Secretary Lin?

00:05:21.199 --> 00:05:22.360
He's won the Perfect Attendance Award...

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.279
For three consecutive years.

00:05:23.279 --> 00:05:24.439
He's never taken a day off!

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:27.000
I wouldn't spread rumors.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.600
Unless...

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:34.120
Unless what?

00:05:40.839 --> 00:05:42.759
Tell us, tell us!

00:05:43.160 --> 00:05:44.279
Listen up, everyone.

00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:46.680
About President Qin...

00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:52.040
President Qin.

00:05:53.920 --> 00:05:54.759
Hello, President Qin?

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.959
What?

00:05:58.399 --> 00:05:59.519
Oh, okay.

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:02.199
But...

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:03.360
But...

00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.160
About this matter of yours...

00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:05.839
Why not just ask a lawyer?

00:06:10.279 --> 00:06:11.079
Yes.

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:13.319
It is a little embarrassing.

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:19.439
Unlawful Entry into a Residence...

00:06:19.439 --> 00:06:22.399
Refers to entering someone's residence without the owner's consent...

00:06:22.399 --> 00:06:24.480
Or forcibly entering their home...

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:27.040
Or refusing to leave after being asked by the owner.

00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.720
Refusing to leave after being asked.

00:06:29.240 --> 00:06:30.639
For example, without permission...

00:06:30.639 --> 00:06:33.279
Prying open a door or climbing over a wall, etc.

00:06:33.319 --> 00:06:34.959
All constitute unlawful entry.

00:06:35.040 --> 00:06:37.000
But I didn't pry the door open.

00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.439
It's Secretary Lin's fault for not answering his phone.

00:06:44.959 --> 00:06:45.959
Secretary Lin.

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:27.800
Looking at it this way...

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:30.040
He really is quite handsome.

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:45.199
Why is it taking so long today?

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:52.720
This doesn't taste right.

00:07:52.759 --> 00:07:55.000
Because the shop you specified was closed.

00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.480
And you wouldn't accept any other.

00:07:56.720 --> 00:07:58.680
Besides, it's just plain congee.

00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.000
So I made it myself.

00:08:01.079 --> 00:08:03.079
If it's not from that shop, I won't eat it.

00:08:07.319 --> 00:08:08.360
Secretary Lin.

00:08:08.839 --> 00:08:09.920
What happened to your hand?

00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:13.240
I accidentally burned it while cooking the day before yesterday.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.040
It looks pretty serious.

00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:16.959
It's nothing.

00:08:17.079 --> 00:08:18.120
I've already applied medicine.

00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:20.040
I never thought Secretary Lin...

00:08:20.040 --> 00:08:21.480
With that righteous gentleman's face of his...

00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.639
Actually knows how to cook.

00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.240
Actually, I don't.

00:08:24.439 --> 00:08:25.600
That's why there was an accident.

00:08:43.919 --> 00:08:44.720
First, turn on the heat.

00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:00.159
Rinse the rice.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:04.559
Wash the rice clean.

00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:36.679
Pour the rice into the pot.

00:09:37.279 --> 00:09:38.480
Pour the rice into the pot.

00:09:38.559 --> 00:09:39.720
Pour the rice into the pot.

00:09:58.440 --> 00:09:59.039
President Qin.

00:09:59.039 --> 00:09:59.919
What are you...

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.639
I...

00:10:18.679 --> 00:10:19.799
The tofu is still here.

00:10:21.759 --> 00:10:22.960
They said they reached an agreement...

00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.080
To take turns raising her each month.

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:29.440
I can't believe they thought of that.

00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:32.360
Thank you.

00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.320
It's very delicious.

00:10:41.759 --> 00:10:42.639
This doesn't taste right.

00:10:42.679 --> 00:10:43.879
If it's not from that place, I won't eat it.

00:10:46.519 --> 00:10:47.320
I'm sorry.

00:10:51.919 --> 00:10:53.879
Although I don't know why I'm apologizing,

00:10:54.799 --> 00:10:57.440
but they say when you feel sorry,

00:10:57.440 --> 00:10:58.519
you should say it like this.

00:10:59.399 --> 00:11:00.200
Secretary Lin.

00:11:00.799 --> 00:11:02.399
I want to ask you a question.

00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:04.720
That day in the elevator,

00:11:05.039 --> 00:11:07.000
why did you have such a big reaction?

00:11:07.879 --> 00:11:10.000
Did you think of something bad?

00:11:16.639 --> 00:11:17.440
Secretary Lin.

00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:21.159
It's nothing.

00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.480
It was probably due to lack of sleep.

00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:25.240
Just a common neurotransmitter imbalance.

00:11:36.799 --> 00:11:37.440
Boss.

00:11:37.720 --> 00:11:39.080
I'm really grateful to you today.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:42.039
Secretary Lin, who hasn't slept well in three years,

00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.639
should take this chance to rest properly.

00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.360
I'm sorry for delaying your work.

00:11:47.639 --> 00:11:48.480
I apologize.

00:11:50.039 --> 00:11:50.840
It's fine.

00:11:52.639 --> 00:11:53.440
Oh, right.

00:11:54.159 --> 00:11:55.879
I have to go meet someone soon,

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.320
so I won't keep you company.

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.519
You get some good rest.

00:11:58.840 --> 00:12:00.440
Don't worry about work.

00:12:02.159 --> 00:12:02.960
Don't go.
