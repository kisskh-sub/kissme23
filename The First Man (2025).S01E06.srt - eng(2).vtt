00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.610
Tae Pyung. What did you say about Mom?

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:03.640
(Episode 6)

00:00:04.280 --> 00:00:05.340
What?

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:07.080
Don't tell me she got lost again.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:08.680
How could you let this happen?

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:10.620
I thought I told you
not to let Mom go out alone!

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.230
Where is Jang Mi?

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:22.430
Please, take me to my Jang Mi.

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:23.930
For crying out loud...

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.530
I have to get to Jang Mi.

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.100
Jang Mi!

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:35.710
I just want to see my Jang Mi.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:40.480
Where is she?
Please, take me to my Jang Mi.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.350
- What's her problem?
- What's going on over there?

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:43.550
Will you get out of my way?

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:45.880
You crazy old hag, what is wrong with you?

00:00:46.180 --> 00:00:47.750
It looks like there was an accident.

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:49.690
Let go of me.

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:52.160
- I said let go.
- It looks like a fight's breaking out.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:54.990
I have to get to Jang Mi.

00:00:55.330 --> 00:00:58.360
- Take me to her! Please, take me.
- What is wrong with you?

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.770
Take me to Jang Mi.

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:05.170
- I said let go!
- Take me to Jang Mi.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:07.010
(Chairman)

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:09.910
Yes, Father.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:12.310
Seo Rin?

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:15.680
Yes. I heard
he returned from Paris yesterday.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.080
Why is it so hard for me
to get a look at my own granddaughter?

00:01:19.250 --> 00:01:20.890
- I'm sorry, Father.
- Where's Jang Mi?

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:22.620
It seems Seo Rin
is at the department store...

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:23.960
to buy you a present.

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.260
Seo Rin should be home any minute now.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:29.790
Jang Mi! Let's go find Jang Mi!

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.470
- Let's go!
- Let me go!

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:38.470
She was at that park last time, remember?

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:39.840
Go check there.

00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:41.340
I'm on my way.

00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:45.780
Call me if anything happens.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:11.470
Am I at the department store?

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.610
No, Mom. I'm at home right now.

00:02:16.570 --> 00:02:20.010
Gosh, she can lie without batting an eye.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.320
Anyway, where could Mom have gone?

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.590
I hope she's okay.

00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:41.170
Are you really home?

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:44.500
Perfect. If you're home,
get changed and come out.

00:02:44.870 --> 00:02:47.110
We have to let everyone know you're back.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:51.410
I literally just got back.

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:54.850
- Let's deal with that later, Mom.
- Later?

00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.020
Fine. I guess it wouldn't hurt
to take it slow.

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:00.890
But don't you dare back out of this later.

00:03:02.990 --> 00:03:05.660
Who does she take after,
lying so shamelessly like that?

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.160
It's just one thing after another.

00:03:08.460 --> 00:03:11.730
Don't worry too much.
I'm sure Seo Rin has her reasons.

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.430
Reasons? Please.

00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.270
If she had a thought in her head,
she'd have visited yesterday on returning.

00:03:17.270 --> 00:03:20.100
And she decides to come home reluctantly
after messing around who knows where?

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:22.340
She's at the age
where she just wants to have fun.

00:03:22.770 --> 00:03:25.540
And you.
Are you Seo Rin's father or something?

00:03:26.680 --> 00:03:29.580
Stop acting like you're her father.
It's not your place.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.850
Yes. I understand.

00:03:34.390 --> 00:03:37.620
I'm moving up the date of Seo Rin's
official succession announcement.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.730
But she isn't ready to take over,
and her leadership is untested.

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:42.090
Are you sure that's wise?

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.200
She has me.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:48.500
I've worked day and night for Dream Group
for the last 30 years.

00:03:49.170 --> 00:03:53.100
With me backing Ma Seo Rin,
who would dare to oppose her?

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:56.570
Well, there are many people backing you.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:03:58.440
There probably won't be much opposition.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:09.190
Taxi!

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:15.130
What?

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:19.960
- Excuse me. I flagged him first.
- Hey, what are you talking about?

00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:23.100
The driver saw me waving from over there
and stopped for me.

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:24.570
What?

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:29.310
- I waved first and got this cab.
- I'm telling you, I was first.

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:32.140
- Are you going to let go or not?
- I'm not letting go.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:36.010
- I was here first. Why steal my cab?
- Steal your cab?

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.450
I'm telling you, I got this cab first!

00:04:39.880 --> 00:04:40.890
Here, look.

00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:44.420
Since I grabbed it first,
my hand is right on the handle,

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:45.820
and your hand is on top of mine. See?

00:04:45.890 --> 00:04:47.990
What do you mean my hand
is on top of yours?

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:49.190
They're side by side.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.530
Just get in, one of you.
Are you going to argue all day?

00:04:57.200 --> 00:05:00.100
- Goodness, thanks a lot.
- Oh, my.

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.010
So you're just going to be a coward
and use brute force?

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.080
Why would you call me a coward?
I can't stand being called that.

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:15.450
I was simply following
the natural order of things.

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:18.160
That's not what that means,
and you know it.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:19.420
Look, whatever.

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:22.130
I'm too busy to stand here
and argue with you.

00:05:23.290 --> 00:05:25.760
Seriously? Why else would you take a cab
if you weren't busy?

00:05:26.060 --> 00:05:28.930
I'm in a huge hurry too.
That's the whole point of taking a cab.

00:05:29.270 --> 00:05:31.900
Gosh, I'm this close to punching him.

00:05:34.070 --> 00:05:37.080
Sir, I'm in a real hurry.
Can you please step on it?

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:38.940
Okay, where to?

00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.140
- The Seonhwa Flower Market.
- Hangang-dong.

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:44.580
Excuse me, you both spoke at once,
so I couldn't hear you. One at a time.

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:45.820
- Hangang-dong.
- The Seonhwa Flower Market.

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:48.250
- Gosh.
- Oh, for crying out loud.

00:05:48.250 --> 00:05:51.490
I said one at a time!
Miss, where did you say you were going?

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:54.760
The Seonhwa Flower Market.

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.260
- And you, sir?
- Sir, drop by the Hangang Law Office,

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:00.570
and then head to Jungjin-dong.

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:05.270
Okay, we'll drop the lady off first,
and then you, sir. That's perfect.

00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:07.740
- Great, please hurry.
- Wait, sir.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:09.170
You've got to be kidding me.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:30.130
- Take me to Jang Mi.
- I said let go!

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.530
- Come on.
- Hey, get off!

00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:36.400
- Let's go!
- Let go of me!

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:38.600
Let's go!

00:06:39.300 --> 00:06:40.300
That's strange.

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.840
I feel like I've seen that face
somewhere before.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:45.780
Who was that?

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:56.120
You're just getting home?

00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.820
Wait, why is Assistant Manager Jin
carrying your bags?

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:03.590
Director Ma called me from the airport,
so I went to pick her up.

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:08.170
Assistant Manager Jin is like my servant.
Mom, why would you even ask that?

00:07:08.330 --> 00:07:10.800
- Where's Grandpa?
- He's in his study. Go say hello first.

00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:12.700
Thank you for your help,
Assistant Manager Jin.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:16.040
It was my pleasure.
I'll be on my way, then.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.980
Seo Rin!

00:07:20.310 --> 00:07:23.710
Grandpa!

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:29.450
- Grandpa, did you miss me?
- Of course I did. Let me look at you.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.160
Here, look.
I've gotten even prettier, haven't I?

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:37.430
You're more beautiful than ever.
How long has it been since I saw you?

00:07:37.660 --> 00:07:40.530
If you keep getting prettier like this,
you'll make your old grandpa worry.

00:07:40.600 --> 00:07:41.830
What? Why?

00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:46.200
I'm worried enough as it is.
Get prettier, and the boys will swarm you.

00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:48.510
They'll all be flocking to you
and making a fuss.

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.410
Don't worry, Grandpa.
I'll marry whoever you choose.

00:07:54.710 --> 00:07:56.650
- Really?
- Of course.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:58.780
I mean it.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:02.050
Based on the way Seo Rin acts,

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:03.860
she's not a complete airhead.

00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:12.560
Ma Seo Rin.

00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:14.800
Me? Your servant?

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.470
You do nothing but fool around all day.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.270
Who do you think you are
to treat me like that?

00:08:21.010 --> 00:08:22.510
What have you ever accomplished
on your own?

00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:26.940
All you did was be born his granddaughter
with a silver spoon in your mouth.

00:08:35.820 --> 00:08:38.190
Since we shared the cab,
I'll pay the fare.

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.060
Just my half.

00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.360
Half?

00:08:42.460 --> 00:08:44.430
Forget it, just get out.

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:48.730
Sir, please just charge me for half.

00:08:48.770 --> 00:08:51.340
Look, you were trying to pull a fast one
to get a free ride.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.800
Now you're embarrassed,
so you're just acting.

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:55.040
Just go.

00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:58.280
- I'll write this off as stepping in poop.
- Excuse me? Poop?

00:08:58.810 --> 00:09:01.550
Gosh, I can't believe this guy.
Are you finished?

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:02.650
Hurry up and get out.

00:09:03.250 --> 00:09:04.350
Come on, sir.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:07.080
I said, just charge me for half the fare.

00:09:07.150 --> 00:09:11.390
Look, it's a real hassle
to split the fare on the meter.

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.460
Just work it out between the two of you.

00:09:19.330 --> 00:09:21.930
So you insist on paying a few dollars
just to feel good about yourself?

00:09:22.800 --> 00:09:24.970
Listen here, you narrow-minded jerk.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:30.170
I'm in a hurry, so I'll make this quick.
Try practicing three virtues in your life.

00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:33.540
Consideration, humility, and kindness.
Got it?

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.710
- Stop living like that.
- Yes, right back at you.

00:09:38.250 --> 00:09:39.250
Here.

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:44.090
Here. I've officially paid my share,
so use this to pay for the rest.

00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:45.690
Thank you.

00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.890
This woman is unbelievable.
Fine, if you're so desperate to pay.

00:09:49.190 --> 00:09:50.390
Great. I got five dollars.

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:55.330
I can't believe her.

00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:04.710
What is wrong with her?

00:10:08.410 --> 00:10:11.550
- Dad, where's Mom?
- Jang Mi, let's go.

00:10:11.620 --> 00:10:12.620
What?

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.490
We just got a call
from the police station.

00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:15.750
What did you say?

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.600
- Mom!
- Suk Hee.

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:30.370
- Mom!
- My Jang Mi's here. It's my Jang Mi.

00:10:30.530 --> 00:10:32.470
Look at what I'm eating now.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.710
- Jang Mi.
- Mom. Thank goodness.

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.440
- Mom, are you hurt anywhere?
- No.

00:10:41.180 --> 00:10:42.550
Thank you so much.

00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.780
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:46.180
Thank you.

00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:48.690
Suk Hee says thank you too.

00:10:49.790 --> 00:10:52.160
That's right, Mom. You're very good at it.

00:10:53.490 --> 00:10:56.630
Who bought you this?
Did the police officer get it for you?

00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.600
Suk Hee was crying
because she wanted to see Jang Mi.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:03.530
- That officer gave it to me.
- Goodness.

00:11:03.730 --> 00:11:06.370
- We're so grateful for all your help.
- Thank you.

00:11:06.970 --> 00:11:10.210
- I missed my Jang Mi.
- Goodness.

00:11:11.010 --> 00:11:12.840
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:17.150
I'm sorry, Mom.

00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.890
From now on, I'll stay right by your side
so you won't have to look for me.

00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:23.750
- Okay?
- Yes.

00:11:26.920 --> 00:11:27.930
I'm sorry.

00:11:30.690 --> 00:11:31.700
I'm so sorry.

00:11:34.900 --> 00:11:36.800
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.470
Gosh.

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.210
Don't overdo it just because you're upset.
You'll have a rough day tomorrow.

00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.680
What?

00:12:19.310 --> 00:12:21.010
I've already had
more than half the bottle.

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:25.120
I'd better listen to my girl.

00:12:26.550 --> 00:12:28.350
Don't be too upset.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.620
- It's not the first time Mom's done this.
- You're right.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:36.090
Is your mom asleep?

00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.060
Yes.

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:40.230
She must have had a rough day.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.500
Of course she did.

00:12:44.170 --> 00:12:46.870
Imagine how scared she must have been,
getting lost like that.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:50.670
It's a good thing someone called it in.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:52.940
Tell me about it.

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:56.750
Every time I see your mom like this,
my blood just boils.

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.750
To think that Suk Hee,
who was so smart and brilliant,

00:13:00.550 --> 00:13:02.550
ended up like this.

00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:06.560
And whoever did this to your mom...

00:13:06.560 --> 00:13:07.690
If I ever find them,

00:13:08.490 --> 00:13:11.760
I'll chase them to the ends
of the fiery pit and make them pay.

00:13:20.770 --> 00:13:22.140
What now?

00:13:22.140 --> 00:13:24.010
Why would you tell me an obvious lie?

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.380
- What are you talking about?
- You said you were home when we spoke.

00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.310
How could you lie about being home
when you weren't even here?

00:13:31.450 --> 00:13:34.520
- Is that what's important right now?
- What did you say?

00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:37.660
Isn't the important thing
whether I paid my respects to Grandpa?

00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:41.230
Don't worry.
I'm going to be the one taking over Dream.

00:13:41.290 --> 00:13:44.700
Look at how you talk.
You think you can walk all over me?

00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.870
Why pick a fight you can't win?
That's not like you.

00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.600
Seriously, though.

00:13:50.030 --> 00:13:52.200
Are you really that confident
you can take over Dream?

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.100
Confident?

00:13:54.610 --> 00:13:57.010
Dream is going to be mine anyway.
What's confidence got to do with it?

00:13:57.580 --> 00:13:59.040
Whether I'm just the director...

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:01.450
of Food and Beverage at Dream Hotel
in name only...

00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:05.050
and spend a few months gallivanting
around the world,

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.150
or work myself to the bone over there,

00:14:08.350 --> 00:14:09.850
it's going to be mine,

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:12.320
- no matter what.
- Ma Seo Rin.

00:14:12.520 --> 00:14:13.520
Am I wrong?

00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:17.760
- Mom, what are you so worried about?
- Stop being so naive and reckless.

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:20.830
Even if you are
Chairman's one and only granddaughter,

00:14:20.830 --> 00:14:24.770
that's not how the business
and world work, you naive child.

00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.610
Do you think the board of directors
will just let that slide?

00:14:28.640 --> 00:14:30.140
Even as we speak,

00:14:30.410 --> 00:14:34.450
countless wolves are eyeing your position,
just waiting for their chance to strike.

00:14:34.650 --> 00:14:35.780
And you can afford to be so complacent?

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:39.880
Right. You think the sky is falling.
I'm surprised you can even walk.

00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:42.720
Seriously...

00:14:43.150 --> 00:14:44.590
Mark my words!

00:14:51.430 --> 00:14:53.230
Hong Ju, have you had dinner?

00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:55.500
If you haven't, I can fix you something.

00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.240
Who eats dinner every single night?
I need to go on a diet.

00:14:59.240 --> 00:15:01.040
Goodness, listen to you.

00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.640
With a figure like yours, what's to lose?
Stop harping on about a diet.

00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:07.850
Keep this up, and you'll get osteoporosis
while you're still young.

00:15:08.110 --> 00:15:09.180
Mom.

00:15:09.750 --> 00:15:11.480
Why are you still living like this?

00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:12.980
- What?
- I'm asking...

00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:16.150
why you still live like this.
Why are you always stuck in one place?

00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.760
- Why, you little...
- What does Seo Rin have that I don't?

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:23.160
All she ever did was be born
with a silver spoon in her mouth.

00:15:23.490 --> 00:15:27.400
But I clawed my way up to where I am.
All by myself.

00:15:29.500 --> 00:15:32.640
- I know.
- So do something to help me.

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.770
Seo Rin is humiliating me,
and it's driving me insane.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:39.810
She treats me like her personal slave.
But her spot...

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:41.880
could have been my spot, you know?

00:15:42.110 --> 00:15:46.350
- Seo Rin humiliated you again?
- And when is it ever any different?

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:49.550
Seo Rin has done nothing on her own merit.

00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:52.520
And yet, she treats me like something
she scraped off her shoe.

00:15:52.790 --> 00:15:54.220
She orders me around
like I'm her personal maid.

00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:55.930
The nerve of her.

00:15:58.400 --> 00:15:59.460
All right.

00:16:00.360 --> 00:16:01.370
Just you wait.

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:24.090
No! Give me back my baby! No!

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:26.560
- No!
- Jung Suk Hee, get this straight.

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:31.630
From now on, this baby is mine.
I said she's my baby now!

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:34.330
Ma Seo Rin.

00:16:34.570 --> 00:16:36.870
Don't forget
that you owe everything you have to me.

00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:38.940
So from now on,

00:16:39.470 --> 00:16:41.140
I won't forgive any more of your lies.

00:16:49.050 --> 00:16:53.280
Let's give a warm welcome to Kang Jun Ho,
returning triumphantly from the U.S!

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:54.550
A round of applause!

00:16:54.950 --> 00:16:56.150
- Kang Jun Ho.
- Kang Jun Ho.

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:57.520
- Kang Jun Ho.
- Kang Jun Ho.

00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:58.760
Kang Jun Ho.

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:01.660
Welcome to Korea.

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:06.330
- Welcome home.
- Gosh, I told you not to do all this.

00:17:06.430 --> 00:17:11.140
You just don't get it, do you?
We do this so Mom and Dad won't be lonely,

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.570
and it makes the house feel more alive.
Right?

00:17:13.570 --> 00:17:15.810
Right. Baek Ho has a point.

00:17:16.440 --> 00:17:18.110
Let me get a look at you, my eldest.

00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.280
The U.S. must have been good for you.
You're glowing.

00:17:22.650 --> 00:17:25.680
Hey, man. How about we say hello,
American style?

00:17:30.190 --> 00:17:32.320
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

00:17:32.320 --> 00:17:33.360
Come on.

00:17:37.530 --> 00:17:41.270
- Jun Ho, you're back for good, right?
- Yes, Dad.

00:17:41.270 --> 00:17:43.530
Jun Ho, congratulations
on being the head chef...

00:17:43.530 --> 00:17:44.740
at the Dream Hotel restaurant.

00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:46.270
Congratulations
from the bottom of my heart.

00:17:46.740 --> 00:17:48.470
Here's a present to celebrate.

00:17:48.710 --> 00:17:50.910
What? Why's this so light?

00:17:52.280 --> 00:17:53.280
You shouldn't have.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:54.410
It was a sure thing.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:57.180
Was that a gift for Jun Ho?

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:03.020
You're pulling a prank, aren't you?

00:18:03.550 --> 00:18:04.690
What are you talking about?

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:09.230
- What?
- I already wore it.

00:18:09.660 --> 00:18:10.830
You did, Mom?

00:18:10.830 --> 00:18:15.730
It's lingerie.
Why buy lingerie for your brother?

00:18:21.370 --> 00:18:22.510
Oh my.

00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:27.380
To think my Baek Ho
would even buy his mother underwear.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:30.950
He's all grown up.

00:18:42.490 --> 00:18:45.630
I just assumed you bought it for me,
so of course I wore it.

00:18:46.130 --> 00:18:47.600
And it was a perfect fit.

00:18:47.830 --> 00:18:49.770
I was just saying what a good eye
you have for these things.

00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.400
- Mom!
- What?

00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:54.400
What's going on?
Wasn't that a gift for your mother?

00:18:54.670 --> 00:18:56.540
- It looked nice on her.
- No, that's not...

00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:00.610
- I think the bags got switched.
- What? Switched with whose?

00:19:01.380 --> 00:19:02.450
What?

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:03.780
Nevermind, Mom.

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:05.980
That's right. It was your gift.

00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:11.190
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:19:11.190 --> 00:19:14.120
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

00:19:14.290 --> 00:19:17.230
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:21.060
- Happy birthday, dear Mom
- Happy birthday, dear Suk Hee

00:19:21.130 --> 00:19:24.800
- Happy birthday to you
- Happy birthday to you

00:19:29.940 --> 00:19:31.780
Happy birthday, Mom.

00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:36.610
- Happy birthday, Suk Hee.
- Happy birthday, Mom.

00:19:37.410 --> 00:19:39.120
Jang Mi, give me a kiss.

00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:46.360
Goodness. A birthday cake!

00:19:47.220 --> 00:19:50.360
Ta-da! A birthday present for my mom.

00:19:51.060 --> 00:19:52.900
I'm sure it's a lipstick.

00:19:53.030 --> 00:19:57.430
- Jang Mi got me a lipstick last year too.
- It's different, Mom.

00:19:57.670 --> 00:19:58.770
Open it.

00:20:04.470 --> 00:20:05.480
This is...

00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:06.940
What?

00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:08.550
This is...

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:11.650
Oh, no, what is this?

00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:13.020
That scared me!

00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:16.390
What is this?

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:19.360
- Look at this.
- Mom!

00:20:19.390 --> 00:20:22.760
What is this? Oh Jang Mi, did you
really get Mom that for her birthday?

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:27.460
- That's not what I got her.
- Bok Gil, look what Jang Mi bought me.

00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:29.700
Goodness. It looks like...

00:20:29.730 --> 00:20:32.900
Jang Mi really nailed your taste, Suk Hee.

00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.110
That's weird. No, this can't be right.

00:20:37.940 --> 00:20:39.040
What now?

00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.350
- Here.
- What?

00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.310
Look.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.580
It's an elephant!

00:20:47.750 --> 00:20:51.250
Mr. Elephant's nose is his hand

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:55.030
Give him a snack, he'll use his nose

00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:56.290
Hey, Oh Jang Mi.

00:20:56.290 --> 00:20:58.300
- He eats it with his nose
- Is this really for Mom?

00:20:58.460 --> 00:20:59.560
No.

00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:02.430
I think they got switched.

00:21:03.800 --> 00:21:07.870
That's not her gift.
Mom's was something really pretty!

00:21:08.540 --> 00:21:11.580
Darn it. I can't believe that guy.

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:21.550
How am I going to switch this back
with that woman?

00:21:27.220 --> 00:21:28.790
Tae Pyung would love this.

00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:42.040
Father, Seo Rin is back
from her training abroad.

00:21:42.040 --> 00:21:44.340
- She's returning to work starting today.
- Is she?

00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.440
Grandpa, you must be bored.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.550
How about I skip work and we go on a date?
It's been a while.

00:21:49.550 --> 00:21:51.650
Seo Rin, this is no time for jokes.

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:54.150
Did you forget that your grandfather
is the chairman of Dream Group?

00:21:54.380 --> 00:21:56.220
When does he ever have time to be bored?

00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:58.020
Stop talking nonsense and let's go.

00:21:58.720 --> 00:22:00.220
We'll be heading out now, Father.

00:22:01.060 --> 00:22:02.690
I'm off, Grandpa.

00:22:02.690 --> 00:22:05.030
All right. Don't overdo it
on your first day back.

00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:06.300
Okay.

00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.470
Chairman.

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:19.610
What brings you here?

00:22:19.940 --> 00:22:22.750
I just saw CEO Chae on her way out.

00:22:23.480 --> 00:22:24.580
Ma'am.

00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:29.920
- Please prepare this for Chairman.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.290
What's that?

00:22:33.990 --> 00:22:36.490
It's ripe persimmons. Your favorite.

00:22:36.990 --> 00:22:41.000
Hwa Young won't let me eat that.
She says it'll spike my blood sugar.

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.530
I know.

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:46.800
Everyone's going crazy
over blood sugar spikes these days.

00:22:47.200 --> 00:22:50.210
But I could never bring myself
to keep you from your persimmons.

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:51.580
What?

00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:55.680
Don't you remember?

00:22:56.950 --> 00:23:01.750
I was having a hard time with CEO Chae
and was crying in secret.

00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:05.090
That's when you handed me
a ripe persimmon.

00:23:06.790 --> 00:23:07.860
I did?

00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:11.260
As I ate that sweet ripe persimmon,

00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:13.800
I felt so incredibly comforted.

00:23:14.230 --> 00:23:17.400
For me, ripe persimmons and you...

00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:19.270
are two things I can't live without.

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:22.170
Goodness, what kind of thing
is that to say?

00:23:28.780 --> 00:23:30.480
I asked the doctor,

00:23:30.750 --> 00:23:33.650
and he said having one once in a while
is perfectly fine.

00:23:34.620 --> 00:23:35.720
Here you go.

00:23:37.390 --> 00:23:39.690
Go on. Here you go.

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:46.030
And taking a walk after you eat
would be the icing on the cake.

00:23:46.330 --> 00:23:47.830
I've already found the perfect route.

00:23:48.730 --> 00:23:49.730
Take a walk...

00:23:50.270 --> 00:23:51.600
with me, Chairman.

00:23:52.340 --> 00:23:53.870
Sure, a walk sounds nice.

00:23:54.140 --> 00:23:55.770
- All right.
- Here.

00:24:02.150 --> 00:24:03.950
Hong Ju, just you wait.

00:24:04.410 --> 00:24:06.150
Mom will make sure you're born
with a silver spoon...

00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:09.650
No, a diamond spoon.

00:24:13.120 --> 00:24:16.830
That jerk. I swear I'll hunt him down
and make him pay.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:19.900
And if I don't find him,
I won't be Oh Jang Mi.

00:24:21.970 --> 00:24:23.330
Gosh, seriously.

00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.940
Excuse me, can I ask you a question?

00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:29.470
By any chance,

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:35.810
do you remember the man
who bought this lingerie yesterday?

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:38.980
May I ask why?

00:24:39.420 --> 00:24:41.890
Our shopping bags got switched yesterday.

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:44.450
I need to get the gift
I bought for my mom back,

00:24:45.590 --> 00:24:49.560
but I have no way of contacting him
to switch them back.

00:24:49.630 --> 00:24:50.790
I see.

00:24:51.730 --> 00:24:52.730
Really?

00:24:52.730 --> 00:24:57.430
Could I get the phone number
for his rewards account?

00:24:57.500 --> 00:24:59.440
I'm afraid I can't do that.
It's personal information.

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:04.710
Right. Of course it is.

00:25:06.510 --> 00:25:07.510
Okay, then.

00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:13.850
Gosh, what a mess.

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:16.820
Goodness, I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

00:25:20.090 --> 00:25:21.490
You're that brat from yesterday?

00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.080
(The First Man)

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:43.510
I'll just pay for yours. How much is it?

00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:46.780
- Go get my mom's gift.
- Are you crazy?

00:25:47.150 --> 00:25:49.420
The reason I chose Chang Restaurant...

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:53.120
- is that it's the absolute worst.
- What? That arrogant punk.

00:25:53.290 --> 00:25:55.790
If my dear Jung Suk Hee wants
a whipped cream cake...

00:25:56.230 --> 00:25:59.300
Jung Suk Hee.
How could I have forgotten that name?

00:25:59.630 --> 00:26:02.970
I can't let this go.
I need to return to where I last saw her.

00:26:06.770 --> 00:26:08.770
