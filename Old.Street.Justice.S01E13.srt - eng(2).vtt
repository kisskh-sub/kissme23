00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:41.880
I have some good news to share.

00:00:42.079 --> 00:00:43.479
Xiaoxiao is awake.

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.920
Once he can speak,

00:00:44.960 --> 00:00:46.560
everyone will know the truth.

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:48.240
Dafo's child is awake.

00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:51.240
Didn't they say he needed several dialysis sessions?

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.640
Xiao Bai.

00:00:57.359 --> 00:00:59.759
Do you dare to go to the hospital with me to confront this?

00:00:59.799 --> 00:01:01.359
This rundown hospital in Old Street

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:03.840
couldn't cure such severe poisoning so quickly.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.120
This kid is trying to bluff me.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.519
Fine, let's go.

00:01:08.719 --> 00:01:09.760
I have a clear conscience.

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:10.439
Right, right, right.

00:01:17.319 --> 00:01:18.120
Doctor!

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.640
Doctor!

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.640
How's my child?

00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:20.519
Don't worry, family.

00:01:20.519 --> 00:01:21.560
He's been cured.

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:23.000
He'll be wheeled out shortly.

00:01:23.599 --> 00:01:24.400
Okay, okay.

00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.159
My Xiaoxiao.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:27.239
My Xiaoxiao.

00:01:28.799 --> 00:01:29.519
Doctor!

00:01:30.359 --> 00:01:31.560
Please help him quickly.

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:32.040
Alright.

00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:33.079
Come in.

00:01:33.959 --> 00:01:34.760
Go ahead first.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:37.920
Xiao Bai.

00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:40.000
Weren't we going to confront each other?

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:40.319
Let's go.

00:01:40.319 --> 00:01:40.840
Go.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:44.799
That's great.

00:01:44.799 --> 00:01:45.959
My Xiaoxiao.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:46.959
He's finally better.

00:01:46.959 --> 00:01:47.719
Zhao Fengsheng.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.159
What are you doing here?

00:01:49.159 --> 00:01:50.599
I heard Xiaoxiao was waking up.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:52.480
I'm here to prove my innocence, of course.

00:01:52.599 --> 00:01:53.799
I won't let you see my Xiaoxiao.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.920
Auntie Feng.

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.319
So many people are watching.

00:01:56.319 --> 00:01:57.439
What else are you worried about?

00:01:57.439 --> 00:01:58.239
Besides,

00:01:58.359 --> 00:02:00.200
I was the one who changed Xiaoxiao's attending doctor.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.000
You...

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:02.799
Otherwise, how could he have woken up so early?

00:02:03.719 --> 00:02:04.400
You...

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.599
You're a loser who can't even afford pickled vegetables.

00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:07.680
How could you afford to hire a specialist?

00:02:11.199 --> 00:02:13.719
I did see a new doctor arrive earlier.

00:02:13.919 --> 00:02:15.520
It was you, Yuchen, who invited him, right?

00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:22.159
Xiaoxiao, Xiaoxiao.

00:02:22.159 --> 00:02:22.800
Xiaoxiao.

00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.479
Xiaoxiao.

00:02:23.479 --> 00:02:24.159
Xiaoxiao.

00:02:24.199 --> 00:02:25.000
Xiaoxiao.

00:02:25.439 --> 00:02:26.039
My good grandson.

00:02:26.039 --> 00:02:26.639
Daddy.

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:27.919
Grandpa.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:28.919
Grandma.

00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:30.199
Grandma.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:32.400
Grandma missed you so much.

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:34.840
Good boy, my good boy.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.080
Little chick.

00:02:37.039 --> 00:02:38.400
Chicken Uncle.

00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.560
You little rascal, you do remember me.

00:02:41.719 --> 00:02:44.080
Chicken Uncle, hold me.

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:46.639
What are you trying to do?

00:02:46.639 --> 00:02:48.080
Still trying to lay a hand on our Xiaoxiao?

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:50.159
You blockhead.

00:02:50.159 --> 00:02:51.319
Your son just asked for a hug.

00:02:51.319 --> 00:02:52.560
Why don't you get it?

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.639
Xiaoxiao.

00:02:54.199 --> 00:02:56.599
Do you remember the bad guy who tied you up that day?

00:02:56.719 --> 00:02:58.280
I don't remember.

00:03:00.439 --> 00:03:01.120
See?

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.800
See?

00:03:01.919 --> 00:03:02.719
I told you so.

00:03:02.719 --> 00:03:04.319
Zhao Fengsheng is a liar.

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:09.360
I only remember an uncle who saved me.

00:03:09.360 --> 00:03:11.240
He told me not to sleep.

00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:14.120
Otherwise, if I slept too much, I wouldn't see Daddy

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.439
or Grandpa and Grandma.

00:03:15.719 --> 00:03:17.080
My good boy.

00:03:18.159 --> 00:03:19.680
You've suffered so much.

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:20.479
Xiaoxiao.

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.360
Tell Daddy,

00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:23.159
exactly which uncle saved you?

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:24.960
Him?

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:29.479
Which one?

00:03:29.479 --> 00:03:30.360
Him.

00:03:30.719 --> 00:03:31.520
Xiaoxiao.

00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:32.800
It was me.

00:03:32.800 --> 00:03:34.159
I was the one who carried you back that day.

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:35.280
Have you forgotten?

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.759
Hug.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:43.759
Chicken Uncle.

00:03:43.759 --> 00:03:45.879
The one who saved me was Chicken Uncle.

00:03:49.240 --> 00:03:50.159
Really?

00:03:50.439 --> 00:03:52.039
I wouldn't remember wrong.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:52.840
Good child.

00:03:52.840 --> 00:03:53.599
So good.

00:03:55.199 --> 00:03:56.280
It really was him.

00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:57.639
Now the truth is clear, right?

00:04:02.319 --> 00:04:03.199
Could it be...

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.199
that it really was Shengzi who saved Xiaoxiao?

00:04:11.159 --> 00:04:11.960
Manager Bai

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.560
Dafo

00:04:14.159 --> 00:04:14.960
Uh...

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.360
The child just woke up.

00:04:17.759 --> 00:04:19.480
He's not fully conscious yet.

00:04:20.519 --> 00:04:21.959
Now that things have come to this,

00:04:22.399 --> 00:04:24.560
Manager Bai, tell us the truth.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:27.040
What exactly is your connection

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:28.360
to those traffickers from Daixiang Village?

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:30.759
Bai Yuchen!

00:04:30.959 --> 00:04:33.199
Did you poison our Xiaoxiao?

00:04:33.199 --> 00:04:33.959
Talk!

00:04:35.319 --> 00:04:36.040
It's a misunderstanding!

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:36.519
A misunderstanding!

00:04:36.519 --> 00:04:37.120
A misunderstanding!

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:38.279
Here's what happened.

00:04:39.279 --> 00:04:41.600
Xiaoxiao was already unconscious.

00:04:41.959 --> 00:04:43.759
I was afraid of delaying his treatment,

00:04:43.759 --> 00:04:45.800
so I helped you get the child back.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:46.639
Really!

00:04:46.879 --> 00:04:48.680
You really have some nerve!

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:50.800
I risked my life to save Xiaoxiao.

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:52.480
I told you to bring the child back first.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.279
But what did you do?

00:04:53.279 --> 00:04:55.360
You pinned the trafficker label on me!

00:04:55.360 --> 00:04:56.800
And you made it sound so noble!

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:57.600
Even though

00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:59.560
you, Zhao Fengsheng, carried the child back,

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:00.800
but

00:05:01.079 --> 00:05:02.160
who's to say

00:05:02.199 --> 00:05:03.800
you weren't just putting on an act

00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.839
to avoid being blamed by the neighbors?

00:05:06.959 --> 00:05:08.160
You were faking it!

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:09.199
At a time like this,

00:05:09.199 --> 00:05:10.800
you still want to call me a trafficker?

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.480
Yes!

00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:13.240
You ARE a trafficker, you hear me?

00:05:14.079 --> 00:05:15.160
Bai Yuchen,

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.319
you've been deceiving us for so long.

00:05:18.199 --> 00:05:20.240
From now on, you're banned from Old Street.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:21.000
And another thing!

00:05:21.160 --> 00:05:22.759
Don't you dare try to ruin

00:05:22.759 --> 00:05:23.839
Shengzi and Er Ni's relationship!

00:05:23.839 --> 00:05:24.839
Do you understand?

00:05:25.519 --> 00:05:26.319
Exactly!

00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.879
You Bai family scoundrel!

00:05:28.079 --> 00:05:29.879
So you're that kind of a swindler!

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.519
You schemed and caused all this trouble

00:05:32.519 --> 00:05:34.720
just to trick our Er Ni into marriage, right?

00:05:35.319 --> 00:05:36.120
Thank goodness

00:05:36.199 --> 00:05:38.600
we saw your true colors today.

00:05:39.279 --> 00:05:40.079
Mother-in-law...

00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:42.720
Now that's not fair to say.

00:05:43.319 --> 00:05:44.360
Wasn't it you

00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:46.439
who coveted my position as Qian Group manager

00:05:46.519 --> 00:05:50.439
and pushed your daughter onto me?

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:52.399
You!

00:05:52.839 --> 00:05:54.079
And you, "Buddha"!

00:05:54.079 --> 00:05:54.959
I'm talking to you!

00:05:54.959 --> 00:05:56.040
Aren't you afraid I'll make

00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:57.600
all of you starve?

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:59.560
Who do you think you're talking to?

00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.680
So arrogant!

00:06:01.879 --> 00:06:02.720
Seems to me

00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:04.680
you're the one who'll be starving.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:05.519
Let me tell you,

00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:06.319
I

00:06:06.319 --> 00:06:08.240
am a manager of the Qian Group!

00:06:08.399 --> 00:06:09.439
Crushing you

00:06:09.439 --> 00:06:11.279
is as easy as squashing bugs!

00:06:11.399 --> 00:06:12.839
Is your power really that great?

00:06:14.199 --> 00:06:15.199
Anyone who didn't know better

00:06:15.199 --> 00:06:17.680
would think you're the chairman of the Qian Group.

00:06:18.079 --> 00:06:19.079
Ch-Chairman Qian!

00:06:19.079 --> 00:06:19.480
Y-you...

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:20.480
What brings you here?

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:21.120
You should have told me,

00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:21.519
given me a call.

00:06:21.519 --> 00:06:22.040
Bai Yuchen,

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:24.279
I hereby officially notify you

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.560
that you are fired from the Qian Group.

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.560
Furthermore, in Bianshui,

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.439
any industry related to the Qian Group

00:06:32.839 --> 00:06:34.480
will blacklist you.

00:06:34.759 --> 00:06:35.480
Serves you right! See if you dare strut now.

00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:36.040
No, no, no!

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:36.319
Please!

00:06:36.319 --> 00:06:37.279
Chairman Qian, please don't!

00:06:38.079 --> 00:06:38.639
My heart was only for

00:06:38.639 --> 00:06:39.920
the development of our Qian Group!

00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:41.480
Y-you must give me another chance!

00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:42.319
You offended Mr. Zhao,

00:06:42.319 --> 00:06:43.759
and you still dare to babble here?

00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:44.920
Throw him out.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:45.480
No, wait!

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.399
Mr. Zhao is...

00:06:48.279 --> 00:06:49.279
Mr. Zhao!

00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:51.240
Mr. Zhao!

00:06:53.319 --> 00:06:54.120
I've offended you.

00:06:55.839 --> 00:06:56.519
No.

00:06:56.519 --> 00:06:57.360
Zhao... Zhao Fengsheng.

00:06:57.399 --> 00:06:57.600
No.

00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:58.160
No, no.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:06:59.920
Shengzi, Shengzi.

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:00.600
Please help me.

00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:01.800
I can't lose my job.

00:07:01.800 --> 00:07:02.439
Before, on Old Street...

00:07:02.439 --> 00:07:03.519
Er Ni, it was all my fault.

00:07:03.519 --> 00:07:03.920
I'm a jerk.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:04.720
I'm a jerk.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.879
You can't make me lose my job.

00:07:05.879 --> 00:07:06.199
Get out.

00:07:06.199 --> 00:07:07.160
Please help me.

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:08.360
I'm a jerk, Shengzi.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.040
Get out!

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.720
Get out!

00:07:10.279 --> 00:07:11.480
I can't be without a job.

00:07:11.519 --> 00:07:12.959
I have an old mother to support.

00:07:12.959 --> 00:07:14.480
Shengzi, I'm begging you.

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:15.959
Zhao Fengsheng.

00:07:16.279 --> 00:07:17.079
Brother Zhao.

00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:19.240
I'm truly sorry.

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:21.839
That the Qian Group has such scum.

00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:23.519
Caused you trouble.

00:07:23.519 --> 00:07:24.279
It's fine.

00:07:24.279 --> 00:07:26.480
Chairman Qian, you've helped a lot already.

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:28.279
Neighbors.

00:07:28.879 --> 00:07:30.560
This is the chairman of the Qian Group.

00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:31.439
Chairman Qian.

00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:32.439
Chairman Qian.

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:34.600
The one who changed Xiaoxiao's doctor.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.600
Is him.

00:07:36.399 --> 00:07:36.959
Thank you.

00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.040
Thank you, Chairman Qian.

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:38.839
Ma'am.

00:07:38.839 --> 00:07:39.759
You're welcome.

00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:42.639
This is all because of Brother Shengzi.

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:44.000
That we stepped in to help.

00:07:44.439 --> 00:07:45.240
Shengzi.

00:07:46.199 --> 00:07:47.959
Before, Auntie wrongly blamed you.

00:07:48.279 --> 00:07:49.560
Auntie shouldn't have listened to that Manager Bai.

00:07:49.560 --> 00:07:50.680
That liar's nonsense.

00:07:50.959 --> 00:07:52.839
Auntie thanks you for saving our Xiaoxiao.

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:53.879
Auntie is...

00:07:53.879 --> 00:07:55.079
Apologizing to you.

00:07:55.959 --> 00:07:57.439
Someone your age kneeling to me...

00:07:57.439 --> 00:07:58.279
Will shorten my life!

00:07:58.279 --> 00:07:59.439
I should be kneeling to you.

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.120
Thank you.

00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.560
We're all neighbors here.

00:08:03.079 --> 00:08:04.519
As long as the misunderstanding is cleared up.

00:08:04.959 --> 00:08:05.759
Shengzi.

00:08:06.199 --> 00:08:07.319
Shengzi is magnanimous.

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:10.399
This old man is also embarrassed.

00:08:11.600 --> 00:08:12.399
Oh, come on.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:13.720
What are you saying.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:14.439
I'm all...

00:08:14.439 --> 00:08:15.759
Embarrassed now.

00:08:20.079 --> 00:08:21.759
But I've left you some time.

00:08:22.399 --> 00:08:25.000
I want to hear how you'll praise me.

00:08:28.240 --> 00:08:30.680
For... for a whole day?

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:31.600
Yeah.

00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.240
I suffered such great injustice.

00:08:33.519 --> 00:08:35.200
Shouldn't you praise me properly?

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.559
But no repeating.

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:38.320
Alright, alright.

00:08:38.559 --> 00:08:39.639
Okay, okay, okay.

00:08:39.639 --> 00:08:40.120
Okay.

00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:40.720
Okay.

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.200
You chased me away the hardest.

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:42.919
Dafo.

00:08:43.519 --> 00:08:44.519
Then... then...

00:08:44.519 --> 00:08:45.840
Then I'll praise you for two days.

00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.639
Two days.

00:08:50.919 --> 00:08:51.720
Auntie.

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.440
You hit me the hardest.

00:08:53.919 --> 00:08:55.039
Misunderstanding.

00:08:55.039 --> 00:08:55.679
It was all a misunderstanding.

00:08:55.679 --> 00:08:56.200
Misunderstanding.

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:59.440
Misunderstanding, misunderstanding, misunderstanding.

00:08:59.559 --> 00:09:01.000
Misunderstanding, misunderstanding.

00:09:01.559 --> 00:09:02.519
As long as it's a misunderstanding.

00:09:03.279 --> 00:09:04.080
Xiaoxiao.

00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.000
Xiaoxiao.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:05.720
Xiaoxiao.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.000
Do you know why Chicken Uncle...

00:09:07.399 --> 00:09:08.960
Is called Chicken Uncle?

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.960
You loved eating chicken since you were little.

00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:14.919
You ate all the chickens in my house.

00:09:15.039 --> 00:09:15.799
Right, right, right.

00:09:15.799 --> 00:09:16.639
Exactly, exactly.

00:09:16.799 --> 00:09:17.799
It's because...

00:09:18.120 --> 00:09:20.120
I grew up eating from a hundred homes.

00:09:28.879 --> 00:09:29.679
Right.

00:09:30.559 --> 00:09:32.000
From now on, the chickens in our house...

00:09:32.039 --> 00:09:33.159
Will be ready for you too.

00:09:33.159 --> 00:09:34.639
Always ready for you.

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:36.000
Right.

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:36.799
Shengzi.

00:09:37.159 --> 00:09:38.120
I'm sorry.

00:09:41.759 --> 00:09:42.559
Shengzi.

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:43.919
From now on, our Old Street...

00:09:44.919 --> 00:09:46.720
Will always be your family.

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.159
Family.

00:09:50.159 --> 00:09:51.639
Family, family.

00:09:53.759 --> 00:09:54.600
Family.

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.519
What?

00:10:00.919 --> 00:10:03.240
You want me to apologize to that jerk Zhao Fengsheng?

00:10:04.399 --> 00:10:05.039
Dad.

00:10:05.039 --> 00:10:06.080
You might not know this,

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:08.320
Ya Qing almost had a marriage ruined because of him.

00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:09.519
And she was seriously injured.

00:10:09.799 --> 00:10:11.799
How can I apologize to such scum?

00:10:11.799 --> 00:10:13.200
Wouldn't that make our Qian family lose face?

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.320
Take that Bai Yuchen under you,

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.000
he's a typical selfish person.

00:10:18.279 --> 00:10:20.200
He even dared to steal credit from Mr. Zhao.

00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.919
I've already kicked him out of the group.

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:24.399
What?

00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:27.240
How could Manager Bai be such a person?

00:10:27.799 --> 00:10:29.519
Dad, are you mistaken?

00:10:29.519 --> 00:10:30.720
He usually acts...

00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:31.480
Tianyu.

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.320
You will have to manage the group someday.

00:10:34.720 --> 00:10:36.720
You must learn to judge people.

00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:38.000
Just now at the hospital,

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.159
the child named Xiaoxiao,

00:10:39.159 --> 00:10:40.320
in front of everyone,

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.200
has already confirmed it.

00:10:45.600 --> 00:10:46.639
How could this be?

00:10:47.559 --> 00:10:49.480
I almost married Ya Qing to him.

00:10:50.639 --> 00:10:51.919
What have I done?

00:10:53.879 --> 00:10:54.679
But, Dad,

00:10:54.879 --> 00:10:55.639
that Zhao Fengsheng,

00:10:55.639 --> 00:10:57.240
he's definitely not a good person.

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.000
He's just a petty person trying to use our Qian family

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.279
to climb the social ladder.

00:11:00.279 --> 00:11:00.960
He usually...

00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:02.840
I don't care how much you dislike him now.

00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.799
In the face of the entire Qian family's future,

00:11:05.799 --> 00:11:07.080
it's not worth mentioning.

00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.480
What do you mean?

00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:09.720
The Tang family

00:11:09.799 --> 00:11:12.120
is already about to move against our Qian family.

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:14.279
For our Qian family to survive,

00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:16.159
we must have Zhao Fengsheng

00:11:16.399 --> 00:11:18.639
ask Li Xiangping for help and support.

00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.799
Only then do we have a slim chance.

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.240
Young Master Li?

00:11:22.879 --> 00:11:25.360
How could Zhao Fengsheng possibly know Young Master Li?

00:11:25.519 --> 00:11:27.039
Dad, you must be mistaken.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.120
Zhao Fengsheng

00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.240
is the guest that Young Master Li

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:30.720
personally called to ask me to look after,

00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:32.919
the one I waited all day to receive.
