WEBVTT

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.480
I'm asking you.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:39.000
Speak up.

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:40.959
Reporting.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:44.319
Sir.

00:01:44.959 --> 00:01:46.120
She is my friend.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.439
She lives at No. 6, Masfeier Road.

00:01:48.439 --> 00:01:50.519
She's a dance hostess at the Guotai Grand Dance Hall.

00:01:50.519 --> 00:01:53.120
She drank too much with clients these past few days.

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.920
Her throat hurts.

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:55.519
Sir.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:56.480
She...

00:01:56.760 --> 00:01:57.879
is his friend.

00:01:58.439 --> 00:01:59.319
These past few days,

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:00.439
she drank too much.

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:03.120
She's a dance hostess at the Guotai Grand Dance Hall.

00:02:03.519 --> 00:02:05.280
Her throat has been bothering her lately.

00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:07.200
So he brought her to the hospital.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:09.759
It's true.

00:02:11.159 --> 00:02:12.599
Sir is asking you a question.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.400
She's timid.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.199
Don't be afraid.

00:02:15.199 --> 00:02:16.520
Sir is a good man.

00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:17.759
He protects us.

00:02:20.039 --> 00:02:20.639
Miss.

00:02:20.759 --> 00:02:22.479
Don't be scared, it's okay.

00:02:23.759 --> 00:02:24.159
Sir.

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:31.960
Take a look.

00:02:32.639 --> 00:02:33.120
Miss.

00:02:34.159 --> 00:02:36.039
No. 6, Masfeier Road, right?

00:02:36.599 --> 00:02:37.520
Is the address correct?

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:40.039
No problem.

00:02:40.199 --> 00:02:40.800
Alright, alright.

00:02:41.039 --> 00:02:41.439
Thank you.

00:02:41.439 --> 00:02:41.879
Sir.

00:02:57.639 --> 00:02:59.199
In the eyes of the Japanese,

00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:01.840
what exactly does life count for?

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:08.919
That was really dangerous just now.

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:11.159
It's a good thing you didn't answer

00:03:11.159 --> 00:03:12.360
according to the doctor identity

00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:14.120
we originally set up for you.

00:03:14.719 --> 00:03:15.759
Otherwise,

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.479
when they cross-examined us like that,

00:03:17.759 --> 00:03:18.879
we would have been exposed.

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:21.919
I was sweating bullets for you.

00:03:24.319 --> 00:03:24.840
By the way,

00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.479
you said earlier

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:28.800
that I am...

00:03:29.719 --> 00:03:30.319
Guotai...

00:03:30.319 --> 00:03:31.639
a dance hostess at the Guotai Grand Dance Hall.

00:03:32.039 --> 00:03:32.919
A dance hostess?

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.840
How could I possibly be a dance hostess?

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:39.439
This is our contingency plan.

00:03:39.639 --> 00:03:42.000
Xiao Chen went to the safe house on Xiafei Road.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:42.879
Yes.

00:03:43.319 --> 00:03:43.680
No.

00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.639
Can I change to a different one?

00:03:46.639 --> 00:03:47.199
Miss Ye.

00:03:48.159 --> 00:03:50.199
This was an emergency. No more discussion.

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:07.960
Hello, Father.

00:04:09.039 --> 00:04:09.639
I'm looking for a book

00:04:09.639 --> 00:04:11.039
written by Joseph Ewa.

00:04:11.039 --> 00:04:12.879
The title is "The Enlightenment Apocalypse."

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.120
It's a very rare and good book.

00:04:17.879 --> 00:04:19.600
But it's not easy to find.

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:20.959
How long will it take to find it?

00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:23.120
A very long time.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.399
I can wait however long it takes.

00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:00.279
Thank you.

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.319
Young man.

00:05:51.519 --> 00:05:52.240
You haven't finished shaving.

00:05:53.079 --> 00:05:53.680
There's still one more.

00:05:53.959 --> 00:05:54.360
Okay.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.759
Shave my face for me later, alright?

00:06:16.759 --> 00:06:17.319
Hello.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.439
My surname is Shen.

00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:20.040
Takeki Ichiro.

00:06:44.079 --> 00:06:45.519
Doesn't look like it.

00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:46.800
Right?

00:06:47.759 --> 00:06:49.160
She doesn't look like a dance hostess, does she?

00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:57.759
What are you doing?

00:06:58.639 --> 00:06:59.560
Let's begin.

00:06:59.959 --> 00:07:01.120
Begin what?

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:04.120
Look in the mirror.

00:07:05.759 --> 00:07:08.279
You are now a dance hostess at the Guotai Grand Dance Hall.

00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:09.959
The person you work with is Rachel.

00:07:09.959 --> 00:07:10.959
That's me.

00:07:10.959 --> 00:07:12.000
I'm your close friend.

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.120
We rent a place together at

00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.920
Room 106, third floor, No. 6, Masfeier Road.

00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:17.759
You must memorize all of this.

00:07:18.519 --> 00:07:19.759
This is your ID card.

00:07:20.199 --> 00:07:20.879
Ration card.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.160
Medical record card.

00:07:22.759 --> 00:07:23.399
Dance hostess license.

00:07:23.839 --> 00:07:25.319
This is information about the dance hall where you work.

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.360
Due to today's emergency,

00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.000
your doctor identity is now void.

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:31.079
What about me looks like a dance hostess?

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.560
The Guotai Grand Dance Hall

00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.759
is located at No. 306, Masketo Road.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.639
Its most notable feature

00:07:36.639 --> 00:07:38.279
is that the dance floor uses

00:07:38.279 --> 00:07:39.399
automobile springs for support.

00:07:40.199 --> 00:07:41.680
When many people dance,

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:43.759
the floor vibrates and tilts,

00:07:43.759 --> 00:07:45.240
giving people an exciting feeling.

00:07:45.319 --> 00:07:46.000
You two, get started.

00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:46.519
Hurry up.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.800
Don't touch me.

00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:49.279
Don't move.

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:55.040
Here is a letter

00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:58.079
of credentials signed by the Japanese Emperor himself.

00:07:58.680 --> 00:07:59.519
This is a copy.

00:07:59.519 --> 00:08:00.399
Take a look first.

00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:04.680
Emperor Showa.

00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:06.040
Investigation Section of the Imperial Aide-de-Camp Department.

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:06.879
Colonel Takeki Ichiro

00:08:06.879 --> 00:08:08.279
is ordered to South and Central China

00:08:08.279 --> 00:08:09.600
to carry out a special investigation mission.

00:08:10.759 --> 00:08:12.160
The signature forgery is quite good.

00:08:13.399 --> 00:08:15.160
Most people wouldn't know it's fake.

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:17.560
This is the original document.

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.680
You must keep it safe.

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:24.759
Get ready.

00:08:25.439 --> 00:08:27.000
In the next couple of days, we'll take you to

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.600
the place where your identity was accidentally exposed.

00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:29.759
What place?

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:31.720
The Inoue Agency.

00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:33.919
Come on in.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.840
For this operation,

00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:39.120
we've arranged an assistant for you.

00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:39.960
Her name is Ye Biying.

00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:42.480
This is her file.

00:08:42.759 --> 00:08:43.639
Take a look first.

00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:45.519
Don't trust me?

00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:46.720
Sending someone to watch me?

00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:47.879
Sending someone to assist you.

00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:49.399
Call it whatever you like.

00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:55.440
All the assessment items

00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:56.519
why are they all blank?

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:01.399
This is for internal records.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.080
You only need to know her current identity

00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.559
is that of a dance hostess.

00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:08.440
Originally, she wasn't supposed to be a dance hostess.

00:09:08.639 --> 00:09:10.080
But there was an incident later.

00:09:10.440 --> 00:09:11.360
Anyway,

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.840
this is how it is now.

00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:13.639
Come here.

00:09:13.639 --> 00:09:14.639
You two get acquainted.

00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.159
After you and her leave Shanghai,

00:09:50.919 --> 00:09:53.120
I will take people to the area opposite Sanzao Island,

00:09:53.399 --> 00:09:55.159
around Zhongshan County or Macau, China.

00:09:55.159 --> 00:09:57.080
to receive you and ensure your safe evacuation.

00:09:57.799 --> 00:09:59.360
If the mission goes smoothly,

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:00.360
you only need

00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:02.279
under the pretense of a normal report to your superiors

00:10:02.559 --> 00:10:04.320
to send a telegram to the Dong Jing side.

00:10:04.320 --> 00:10:07.000
After I intercept it, I will make the arrangements.

00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:08.279
Takeki Ichiro.

00:10:08.440 --> 00:10:10.360
The situation on the island is very complex.

00:10:10.879 --> 00:10:13.159
Once you're on the island, you'll be fighting alone.

00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:14.440
Be careful in everything.

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.240
The Bureau Chief instructs:

00:10:16.559 --> 00:10:18.279
Once you sense danger,

00:10:18.759 --> 00:10:20.159
you may abort the mission on your own authority.

00:10:20.519 --> 00:10:21.399
The escape routes

00:10:21.399 --> 00:10:22.639
we have designated two.

00:10:24.039 --> 00:10:25.480
After you return to the hotel,

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.600
you can review the routes on it,

00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:28.440
and the map.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:33.759
Understood.

00:10:35.879 --> 00:10:36.639
I want to know,

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:38.799
what is the American pilot's mission?

00:10:39.039 --> 00:10:40.399
I don't know that.

00:10:40.759 --> 00:10:42.440
Even the Bureau Chief doesn't know.

00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:44.200
We only know

00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.960
this person is extremely important.

00:10:46.519 --> 00:10:47.039
No matter what,

00:10:47.039 --> 00:10:47.960
we cannot let him fall into

00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:49.320
Japanese hands.

00:10:49.399 --> 00:10:50.559
If possible,

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.919
we also hope you can find out

00:10:53.320 --> 00:10:55.960
what mission he is truly carrying out in China.

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.120
Don't touch me! Don't touch me!

00:10:59.120 --> 00:10:59.720
Let go!

00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:02.720
This one is from the Chinese Communist Party.

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.559
You need to be careful.

00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.399
Understood.

00:11:08.399 --> 00:11:09.639
The Bureau Chief instructs:

00:11:09.639 --> 00:11:10.879
After the mission is completed,

00:11:11.279 --> 00:11:12.360
she must be sacrificed.

00:11:12.559 --> 00:11:13.919
Then you make your own escape.

00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.039
How do we determine her mission

00:11:17.039 --> 00:11:18.120
is fully completed?

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:21.039
By assisting you in finding the messenger,

00:11:21.879 --> 00:11:23.399
and the secret on the messenger

00:11:23.399 --> 00:11:24.480
falls into your hands.

00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:27.240
What about that messenger?

00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.399
That American.

00:11:31.799 --> 00:11:33.159
Try your best to bring him with you.

00:11:34.279 --> 00:11:35.240
And if we can't bring him?

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:35.919
Try your best.

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:39.120
Troublesome.

00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.600
But whether you go to the island or not,

00:11:41.919 --> 00:11:42.720
this girl

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:44.639
knows too many of our secrets.

00:11:44.919 --> 00:11:46.320
The outcome is the same.

00:11:52.039 --> 00:11:53.559
Come over here.

00:12:01.039 --> 00:12:02.639
Take her over there for a look.

00:12:03.159 --> 00:12:04.519
Okay, coming.

00:12:12.200 --> 00:12:12.919
Don't move.

00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:13.279
Come on.

00:12:13.279 --> 00:12:13.600
Begin.

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:14.039
One.

00:12:15.519 --> 00:12:16.039
Another one.

00:12:35.159 --> 00:12:36.039
Are we

00:12:37.039 --> 00:12:37.879
waiting for someone?

00:12:38.639 --> 00:12:39.279
Wait a moment.

00:12:39.279 --> 00:12:40.639
A man will come out here.

00:12:41.399 --> 00:12:42.120
Your task

00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.720
is to find a way to get close to him

00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:46.320
and seize the opportunity to steal a pen from him.

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.480
It contains important intelligence for us.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.639
Something this important,

00:12:51.519 --> 00:12:52.279
but why must it be...

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.279
Only ask about the task,

00:12:53.799 --> 00:12:54.559
don't ask why.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.200
That is also one of an agent's essential qualities.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.039
He's here.

00:13:04.679 --> 00:13:06.399
The one in the gray suit.

00:13:22.279 --> 00:13:23.639
Good evening, Miss Ye.

00:13:25.519 --> 00:13:27.039
Your red wine, please enjoy.

00:13:30.759 --> 00:13:31.480
Waiter!

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:34.440
What would you like, sir?

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:34.759
Hello.

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:41.080
Come on.

00:13:57.559 --> 00:13:58.039
Miss Ye.

00:13:58.039 --> 00:13:58.399
Excuse me,

00:13:58.399 --> 00:13:59.759
Miss Fannie was just looking for you.

00:13:59.759 --> 00:14:00.399
She's here.

00:14:02.679 --> 00:14:04.039
These are flowers from Mr. Wang for you.

00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:04.759
Take them.

00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:07.120
Bye-bye.

00:14:08.679 --> 00:14:09.600
Biying!

00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:11.000
You're late again today.

00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:12.639
Mommy was just asking about you.

00:14:12.639 --> 00:14:14.039
Luckily, I covered for you.

00:14:14.279 --> 00:14:15.320
Aren't you going to thank me?

00:14:16.519 --> 00:14:18.240
Who's this coming?

00:14:20.519 --> 00:14:20.639
Go on.

00:14:20.639 --> 00:14:21.320
Oh, Biying.

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:22.440
Miss Rachel.

00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:24.960
Why are you so late today?

00:14:27.559 --> 00:14:28.799
There's a gentleman over there.

00:14:28.799 --> 00:14:29.879
Go over and see quickly.

00:14:30.039 --> 00:14:30.559
Let's go.

00:14:35.679 --> 00:14:36.960
Sir,

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.679
drinking alone,

00:14:38.679 --> 00:14:39.559
aren't you bored?

00:14:40.039 --> 00:14:41.080
How about

00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:42.759
letting our Miss Biying here

00:14:42.759 --> 00:14:44.279
keep you company for a drink?

00:14:44.279 --> 00:14:44.759
Alright.

00:14:49.919 --> 00:14:51.200
You two enjoy your drinks.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:51.919
Thank you.

00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:03.639
Don't you want to have a drink with me?

00:15:12.879 --> 00:15:14.559
Then let me have another drink with you.

00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.679
After you, Boss Shen.

00:15:18.879 --> 00:15:19.440
After you.

00:15:28.039 --> 00:15:29.480
You're a very beautiful lady.

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:31.720
Thank you.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:32.919
You're Miss Biying, right?

00:15:33.519 --> 00:15:34.519
Which two characters is that?

00:15:37.679 --> 00:15:38.879
Do you have a pen, sir?

00:15:38.879 --> 00:15:39.519
Yes, I do.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.200
These two characters.

00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:08.360
Very nice.

00:16:10.200 --> 00:16:10.639
Here.

00:16:17.559 --> 00:16:19.039
Where are you from, Miss Biying?

00:16:20.759 --> 00:16:21.440
Here.

00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:24.679
Right here.

00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:27.440
Why so nervous?

00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:28.960
Is it your first day working here?

00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:30.200
You look a bit unfamiliar.

00:16:30.919 --> 00:16:32.000
How could that be?

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:33.559
I've been here for many years.

00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.200
It's you, sir,

00:16:35.759 --> 00:16:37.279
who looks a bit unfamiliar.

00:16:43.360 --> 00:16:45.200
I'll come often to support you in the future.

00:16:54.600 --> 00:16:55.399
Excuse me,

00:16:56.039 --> 00:16:57.559
I suddenly need to use the restroom.

00:16:57.759 --> 00:16:58.279
Please.

00:16:58.559 --> 00:16:58.960
Excuse me.

00:17:11.079 --> 00:17:12.000
Mission accomplished.

00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.839
Is this the pen with the intelligence?

00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.400
It should be.

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:26.319
Is the intelligence numbers, or...

00:17:26.359 --> 00:17:27.119
Miss Biying.

00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:34.960
Let me introduce you.

00:17:35.759 --> 00:17:37.640
He is your operations handler.

00:17:40.079 --> 00:17:41.039
Takeki Ichiro.

00:17:42.279 --> 00:17:43.119
Ye Biying.

00:17:45.319 --> 00:17:47.680
Rose, oh Rose.

00:17:48.079 --> 00:17:50.440
The most enchanting.

00:17:51.119 --> 00:17:53.480
Rose, oh Rose.

00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:55.079
You did that on purpose.

00:17:55.079 --> 00:17:55.359
I'm sorry.

00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:57.759
I'm not very good at dancing.

00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.359
What I'm about to tell you,

00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:05.160
you must remember.

00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:07.480
And promise not to tell anyone.

00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.480
I could choose not to take you to the island.

00:18:11.559 --> 00:18:13.440
Although taking you is part of the plan,

00:18:14.759 --> 00:18:15.400
it's more because

00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:16.920
I don't want to see a young life

00:18:17.519 --> 00:18:18.960
disappear from this world.

00:18:21.279 --> 00:18:22.400
If you don't come with me,

00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:25.160
they will eliminate you

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:26.160
before you return to Chongqing.

00:18:26.759 --> 00:18:27.400
How could that be?

00:18:27.519 --> 00:18:28.519
You shouldn't be so surprised.

00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.279
From the moment they activated you,

00:18:30.839 --> 00:18:32.119
they had already decided on this.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:35.200
After they eliminate you,

00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:37.039
they will stage a car accident.

00:18:37.799 --> 00:18:38.279
An accident.

00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.640
A facade you couldn't even imagine.

00:18:42.680 --> 00:18:43.680
Why are you protecting me?

00:18:44.319 --> 00:18:45.400
Are you helping me?

00:18:45.839 --> 00:18:47.279
I will safely take you to the island

00:18:47.799 --> 00:18:49.000
and safely bring you back.

00:18:50.880 --> 00:18:52.000
What kind of person are you, really?

00:18:54.119 --> 00:18:55.519
The "Japanese devil" you speak of.

00:18:56.279 --> 00:18:57.440
A Military Statistics Bureau dog spy.

00:18:58.759 --> 00:19:00.079
If you really can't accept that,

00:19:01.119 --> 00:19:02.440
you can also understand it as

00:19:03.079 --> 00:19:04.920
me having improper thoughts about you.

00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:05.799
Shameless.

00:19:06.279 --> 00:19:07.200
I don't want to dance with you anymore.

00:19:07.519 --> 00:19:08.559
Wait, wait, wait.

00:19:08.559 --> 00:19:09.559
If he won't dance with you,

00:19:09.559 --> 00:19:10.920
I'll dance with you.

00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:12.039
Let go of me!

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:14.720
You dare hit me?

00:19:25.119 --> 00:19:26.160
You just wait!

00:19:26.599 --> 00:19:27.079
Wait!

00:19:27.319 --> 00:19:27.920
Wait!

00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:33.240
Buy me a drink.

00:19:33.759 --> 00:19:34.559
Understood.

00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:36.039
Is it good?

00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.279
Boss.

00:19:39.359 --> 00:19:40.799
There are suspicious people downstairs.

00:19:43.599 --> 00:19:44.960
We need to surface ahead of schedule.

00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:46.759
What?

00:19:47.559 --> 00:19:48.440
Inoue Akira is right upstairs.

00:19:49.799 --> 00:19:50.359
Let's go.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.400
Everything just now was just an act.

00:20:00.599 --> 00:20:01.480
From now on,

00:20:01.480 --> 00:20:02.599
the real mission begins.

00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:03.359
Remember:

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.359
Don't speak carelessly.

00:20:04.359 --> 00:20:05.079
Don't move recklessly.

00:20:05.319 --> 00:20:06.480
Follow my lead in everything.

00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.200
What's going on?

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.359
Please give us a reasonable explanation.

00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:40.559
Didn't you hear Mr. Inoue speaking to you?

00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:42.880
Inoue Akira.

00:20:44.599 --> 00:20:45.559
and Toyama Mitsuru,

00:20:46.079 --> 00:20:46.960
Uchida Ryohei,

00:20:47.279 --> 00:20:48.200
Ogawa Umpei,

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:49.920
Sasaki Kogoro,

00:20:50.279 --> 00:20:52.759
are known as the leaders of Japan's five great *ronin*.

00:20:54.799 --> 00:20:55.559
You are Japanese?

00:20:55.559 --> 00:20:56.720
You speak Japanese?

00:20:58.319 --> 00:20:59.039
Miss Biying.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:00.000
It's too noisy here.

00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.279
Let's go somewhere else.

00:21:03.200 --> 00:21:03.720
Let go of me!

00:21:13.759 --> 00:21:14.880
This gentleman,

00:21:16.079 --> 00:21:18.039
if you cannot clarify your identity,

00:21:18.039 --> 00:21:20.039
you will not be leaving today.

00:21:21.839 --> 00:21:23.400
And if I refuse to say?

00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:25.599
Then we will have no choice

00:21:25.599 --> 00:21:26.799
but to ask you to come with us.

00:21:27.680 --> 00:21:29.599
Mr. Inoue has a Banzai Club

00:21:29.599 --> 00:21:31.279
on Huade Road.

00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.519
He has bribed many Japanese police officers,

00:21:33.519 --> 00:21:34.319
officers,

00:21:34.319 --> 00:21:35.480
and discharged soldiers.

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:37.279
They specialize in activities like

00:21:37.279 --> 00:21:38.799
bombings and assassinations.

00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:41.279
I really dare not go with you.

00:21:42.279 --> 00:21:43.519
You know quite a lot.

00:21:49.279 --> 00:21:50.799
Take out what's in your pocket.

00:22:02.359 --> 00:22:03.680
Takeki Ichiro.

00:22:04.279 --> 00:22:05.359
Investigation Section of the Imperial Aide-de-Camp Department.

00:22:05.359 --> 00:22:06.720
Investigation Section of the Imperial Aide-de-Camp Department.

00:22:06.720 --> 00:22:07.960
Colonel.

00:22:10.079 --> 00:22:12.799
You are from the Emperor's inner circle?

00:22:16.839 --> 00:22:17.599
A member of the Aide-de-Camp Department?

00:22:17.599 --> 00:22:18.480
Instead of staying properly by the Emperor's side,

00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.880
you come here to drink with hostesses?

00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:24.960
I've seen many forged documents,

00:22:26.319 --> 00:22:27.519
but someone as bold as you,

00:22:27.519 --> 00:22:28.359
daring to forge an Aide-de-Camp identity,

00:22:28.359 --> 00:22:29.599
is a first.

00:22:34.319 --> 00:22:36.279
I don't think you have the nerve to open this letter.

00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:40.480
Because you lack the authority to open it.

00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:46.680
Is that so?

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.400
Release this gentleman.

00:23:18.279 --> 00:23:19.799
I was somewhat rash earlier.

00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:22.200
I beg your forgiveness.

00:23:33.039 --> 00:23:35.200
Let us converse upstairs.

00:23:35.759 --> 00:23:37.559
My treat, of course.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.039
I think that's unnecessary.

00:23:40.279 --> 00:23:41.920
My woman was frightened today,

00:23:42.400 --> 00:23:44.279
and this man took liberties with her.

00:23:44.920 --> 00:23:46.279
I think she needs to rest.

00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:47.920
You!

00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:51.279
Apologize to this lady.

00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:53.839
I'm sorry.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.160
Make your attitude more sincere.

00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:58.880
I'm sorry.

00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:05.160
I humbly ask for your understanding.

00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:20.920
Drink this glass of wine.

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:23.920
Consider tonight's events as if they never happened.

00:24:39.359 --> 00:24:40.880
Come, let's have a drink too.

00:24:52.279 --> 00:24:55.839
I am truly sorry, Colonel, Sir.

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:57.720
It's fine.

00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.279
The investigator has just arrived in Shanghai.

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:03.920
What does Inoue need to do?

00:25:04.039 --> 00:25:05.640
Please give your orders.

00:25:06.920 --> 00:25:08.400
Inoue is willing to mobilize

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:09.279
all the forces at my disposal

00:25:09.279 --> 00:25:10.359
to serve you loyally,

00:25:10.359 --> 00:25:11.480
to make up for my disrespect.

00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:12.839
Very well.

00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:15.480
I will be in Shanghai tomorrow.

00:25:15.480 --> 00:25:16.759
The best hotel, the Julehui.

00:25:16.759 --> 00:25:18.200
We'll host another banquet.

00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:19.200
To apologize to the Special Envoy.

00:25:21.839 --> 00:25:22.680
It's fine.

00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.359
I'm only staying in Shanghai for one night.

00:25:24.960 --> 00:25:28.160
That's a real shame.

00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:30.160
The Special Envoy is in such a hurry.

00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.200
You must be on some important business

00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:35.319
for His Majesty the Emperor.

00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:39.119
Serving His Majesty the Emperor

00:25:39.119 --> 00:25:40.279
is my duty.

00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:41.480
To be honest with you, Inoue-san,

00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:43.519
tomorrow I'm taking a ship

00:25:43.519 --> 00:25:45.640
to a naval air base in the south.

00:25:47.119 --> 00:25:48.720
That's no problem.

00:25:49.359 --> 00:25:50.599
The Special Envoy must be

00:25:50.599 --> 00:25:52.319
taking the "Rain Maru" at ten tomorrow night

00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:54.799
to the Sixth Air Base on Sanzao Island, right?

00:25:54.799 --> 00:25:56.720
After the banquet, I'll personally

00:25:56.720 --> 00:25:59.640
see the Envoy onto the ship. How about that?

00:26:03.200 --> 00:26:04.519
How do you know my itinerary?

00:26:05.559 --> 00:26:08.480
Please don't misunderstand, Special Envoy.

00:26:09.799 --> 00:26:12.960
My son is in the Special Police Unit

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:14.759
at the Sixth Air Base on Sanzao Island.

00:26:17.079 --> 00:26:18.279
What a coincidence.

00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:19.119
What a pity.

00:26:19.119 --> 00:26:20.599
Only staying in Shanghai for one night.

00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.079
I haven't even notified

00:26:22.079 --> 00:26:22.759
the Shanghai Garrison.

00:26:24.279 --> 00:26:24.680
Colonel.

00:26:25.279 --> 00:26:25.559
Yes.

00:26:26.119 --> 00:26:29.720
Inoue will definitely secure your presence at the banquet.

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:31.359
How so?

00:26:31.359 --> 00:26:32.319
The Inoue Agency

00:26:32.319 --> 00:26:34.680
is also the most famous

00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:38.279
private investigation agency in Shanghai for the Empire.

00:26:39.759 --> 00:26:40.480
Colonel.

00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.279
Have fun tonight.

00:26:42.680 --> 00:26:44.000
Cheers.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:02.240
You go and keep watch. Report anything to me.

00:27:02.279 --> 00:27:03.279
Yes.

00:27:08.519 --> 00:27:09.920
What's with the drunken act?

00:27:18.039 --> 00:27:18.880
Mr. Takeki.

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:19.799
We have a tail.

00:27:24.039 --> 00:27:25.160
You gave it back to him.

00:27:26.039 --> 00:27:27.720
Why are you following me?

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:29.160
Bring the car over.

00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.119
Yes.

00:27:44.599 --> 00:27:45.200
Careful.

00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.319
Wait for me here.

00:27:48.160 --> 00:27:48.880
Slow down.

00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:13.759
Come in.

00:28:17.599 --> 00:28:18.319
Takeki, you...

00:28:19.359 --> 00:28:20.319
You're not drunk.

00:28:20.880 --> 00:28:21.839
Hurry up and get inside.

00:28:33.519 --> 00:28:34.799
This is the apartment Miss Ye and I

00:28:34.799 --> 00:28:36.200
are staying at in Shanghai.

00:28:36.519 --> 00:28:37.519
You rest for a moment.

00:28:37.839 --> 00:28:38.599
I need to take her

00:28:38.599 --> 00:28:39.759
to get familiar with her room.

00:28:39.759 --> 00:28:40.319
Alright.

00:28:40.559 --> 00:28:41.279
Let's go.

00:29:00.119 --> 00:29:01.440
This will be your room.

00:29:01.559 --> 00:29:02.640
Look around first.

00:29:02.640 --> 00:29:04.039
Get familiar with the layout.

00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:05.839
Memorize this.

00:29:05.839 --> 00:29:07.039
No. 6, Masfeier Road.

00:29:07.279 --> 00:29:07.599
Yes.

00:29:09.880 --> 00:29:10.440
Take this.

00:29:11.079 --> 00:29:12.640
These are your medical records

00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.720
from Ruihua Hospital in Shanghai for last year and this year.

00:29:15.319 --> 00:29:16.640
And the rice purchase records

00:29:16.640 --> 00:29:17.799
from the rice shop across the street.

00:29:17.799 --> 00:29:18.920
The rice shop has them all.

00:29:20.039 --> 00:29:20.839
Where is it?

00:29:21.599 --> 00:29:23.519
About sixty-five meters ahead.

00:29:39.680 --> 00:29:41.359
Take us back to the Dahui Hotel.

00:29:41.359 --> 00:29:42.279
Yes.

00:30:24.680 --> 00:30:25.640
Reporting, Chief!

00:30:29.319 --> 00:30:32.039
What "Chief"?!

00:30:37.400 --> 00:30:38.160
Sir!

00:30:39.119 --> 00:30:41.680
What "Sir"?!

00:30:52.279 --> 00:30:53.039
Fine.

00:30:53.039 --> 00:30:55.400
Call me whatever you want.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:59.119
Let Sir give you a nice big kiss.

00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:05.680
Let me tell you something.

00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:07.079
I've been out of this room

00:31:07.079 --> 00:31:07.960
for four or five hours.

00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.160
They installed a bug in the telephone.

00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:11.519
What you just said

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.119
has likely already exposed us.

00:31:13.279 --> 00:31:14.599
So as long as you're in this room,

00:31:14.599 --> 00:31:15.519
you are not to speak.

00:31:15.519 --> 00:31:15.960
Do you hear me?

00:31:18.839 --> 00:31:19.720
Then what do we...

00:31:20.039 --> 00:31:21.519
What should we do now?

00:31:22.359 --> 00:31:24.640
Draw Sir a bath.

00:31:25.359 --> 00:31:28.039
Accompany Sir in the bath.

00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.720
Will you go first, or shall Sir?

00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:36.119
Or will you bathe with Sir?

00:31:44.359 --> 00:31:45.440
Are you doing this on purpose?

00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:46.559
What "Chief"?

00:31:46.559 --> 00:31:47.119
What "Sir"?

00:31:47.119 --> 00:31:47.960
Are you insane?

00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:48.599
I'm not...

00:31:49.119 --> 00:31:50.079
I just want to ask,

00:31:50.559 --> 00:31:52.119
why do we have to live together?

00:31:52.119 --> 00:31:53.359
Inoue Akira has already seen me.

00:31:53.759 --> 00:31:55.119
The ones following us outside earlier

00:31:55.119 --> 00:31:56.079
were from the Inoue Agency.

00:31:56.279 --> 00:31:57.359
Now our every move

00:31:57.359 --> 00:31:58.839
is being watched right under their noses.

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.680
The Shanghai Garrison's Intelligence Section

00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:01.960
will get the news soon.

00:32:02.079 --> 00:32:03.160
They'll come here to visit me.

00:32:03.359 --> 00:32:04.920
So you staying here with me now

00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:06.720
is our best option.

00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:07.519
Do you understand?

00:32:12.279 --> 00:32:12.839
I need to talk to you.

00:32:12.839 --> 00:32:13.640
Talk about what?

00:32:15.559 --> 00:32:16.000
Miss Ye.

00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:19.279
Do you feel particularly awkward

00:32:19.279 --> 00:32:20.680
and uncomfortable living with me?

00:32:21.799 --> 00:32:23.279
Then I can tell you very responsibly,

00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:25.079
living with you

00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:26.480
is even more awkward for me.

00:32:27.279 --> 00:32:28.079
I'm even more uncomfortable.

00:32:29.839 --> 00:32:30.519
Do you understand?

00:32:34.079 --> 00:32:35.000
I know you won't get it.

00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:36.240
It's like playing music for a cow.

00:32:37.359 --> 00:32:37.799
Get out.

00:32:38.640 --> 00:32:39.559
No.

00:32:40.279 --> 00:32:41.559
I need to have a proper talk with you.

00:32:41.559 --> 00:32:43.200
Sir is going to take a bath now.

00:32:43.400 --> 00:32:43.920
Do you want to watch?

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:45.440
What are you doing?

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:46.200
Taking a bath.

00:33:31.960 --> 00:33:33.920
Have something to eat.

00:33:34.359 --> 00:33:35.400
Okay.

00:33:36.640 --> 00:33:38.160
Have a sweet potato.

00:33:38.359 --> 00:33:40.839
On such a cold day.

00:33:58.720 --> 00:33:59.559
What about the bug?

00:34:05.359 --> 00:34:06.480
Just joking.

00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:07.759
Was it fun?

00:34:08.800 --> 00:34:10.119
Not really suitable for our work.

00:34:17.639 --> 00:34:18.440
Just kidding.

00:34:20.159 --> 00:34:21.039
By the way, I want to know...

00:34:21.599 --> 00:34:23.440
Aren't you Japanese military?

00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.440
Why are you also a Military Statistics Bureau agent?

00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:28.920
I only know we have traitors.

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.119
You have them too?

00:34:31.280 --> 00:34:32.920
What do you call them?

00:34:34.039 --> 00:34:34.639
Japanese traitors.

00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.400
Didn't your superior tell you...

00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.559
not to casually inquire about my affairs?

00:34:45.039 --> 00:34:45.760
Right.

00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.679
Well...

00:34:50.880 --> 00:34:51.559
Aren't you coming out yet?

00:34:54.440 --> 00:34:55.400
Take your time washing up.

00:34:59.559 --> 00:35:00.559
Do you have any pajamas?

00:35:19.440 --> 00:35:21.320
Is your cover identity a dance hostess?

00:35:24.639 --> 00:35:25.880
Our cover identities...

00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:27.119
are we a couple?

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:31.599
I am your superior.

00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:33.800
I have the authority to give you orders.

00:35:34.119 --> 00:35:34.559
Right?

00:35:35.039 --> 00:35:36.039
So you remember this:

00:35:36.199 --> 00:35:37.320
In the future, if we can talk it out,

00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.519
don't resort to violence, got it?

00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:40.159
But I don't know you at all.

00:35:40.239 --> 00:35:41.199
How can I act as your girlfriend?

00:35:41.199 --> 00:35:42.199
What do you mean you don't know me?

00:35:42.800 --> 00:35:43.639
You've seen my file.

00:35:43.639 --> 00:35:44.599
I've seen your file too.

00:35:44.599 --> 00:35:45.599
That means we know each other.

00:35:46.039 --> 00:35:46.840
A file is just a file.

00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:47.559
A person is a person.

00:35:47.719 --> 00:35:48.559
People are living beings.

00:35:48.679 --> 00:35:49.679
Then what do you want to know?

00:35:56.159 --> 00:35:57.320
For example...

00:35:59.159 --> 00:36:00.000
Do you smoke?

00:36:00.320 --> 00:36:00.840
Occasionally.

00:36:01.639 --> 00:36:02.440
Are you married?

00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:03.159
No.

00:36:04.559 --> 00:36:05.519
You don't look like it either.

00:36:05.519 --> 00:36:06.719
What girl would be willing to marry you?

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.599
Are you married then?

00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:08.719
Of course not.

00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:09.480
Be serious.

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:17.079
Didn't you want to get to know each other?

00:36:19.679 --> 00:36:20.800
Here's a book.

00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:22.639
You can read English.

00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.360
At the fastest speed,

00:36:24.559 --> 00:36:25.719
finish reading it.

00:36:25.719 --> 00:36:28.039
Then tell me the passage you find most interesting.

00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:07.440
I'm still just a young girl.

00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:10.599
I've never been in love.

00:37:10.599 --> 00:37:13.599
And I've certainly never slept with anyone.

00:37:14.079 --> 00:37:16.679
In the training I received,

00:37:16.679 --> 00:37:19.239
there was no module for this.

00:37:19.239 --> 00:37:20.920
I know I can trust you.

00:37:20.920 --> 00:37:22.480
And I must trust you.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.920
But no matter what,

00:37:23.920 --> 00:37:26.599
I cannot sleep in the same bed with you.

00:37:26.599 --> 00:37:27.840
Absolutely not.

00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:37.480
I don't understand English.

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.000
I don't understand anything.

00:37:44.079 --> 00:37:44.639
Donkey.

00:37:46.519 --> 00:37:47.320
How adorable.

00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:49.000
Takeki.

00:37:58.679 --> 00:38:01.000
I am neither a stupid donkey...

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.079
nor a foolish donkey.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:07.320
My zodiac is the ox.

00:38:07.679 --> 00:38:09.760
I don't belong to the donkey.

00:38:11.719 --> 00:38:13.679
Let me put it this way:

00:38:13.679 --> 00:38:16.639
This is like playing music for an ox.

00:38:16.639 --> 00:38:18.000
A complete waste of effort.

00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:23.360
Please go to your own bed.

00:38:23.840 --> 00:38:25.079
And good night.

00:39:08.519 --> 00:39:09.880
My god.

00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:14.199
He took two dance hostesses...

00:39:14.199 --> 00:39:15.280
from the Guotai Grand Dance Hall.

00:39:15.280 --> 00:39:15.880
One of them...

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.360
is the person we saw today.

00:39:18.880 --> 00:39:20.360
Then he took those two hostesses...

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.960
to a residence.

00:39:22.519 --> 00:39:23.360
Probably...

00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:24.840
the envoy's woman went back...

00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:26.960
to get some clean clothes.

00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:28.039
Finally,

00:39:28.039 --> 00:39:29.320
the envoy took that woman...

00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.400
to the Grand Metropolis Hotel.

00:39:32.159 --> 00:39:33.960
Didn't they meet anyone special?

00:39:34.719 --> 00:39:35.480
Nothing was observed.

00:39:39.159 --> 00:39:41.039
Even someone close to the Emperor...

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.559
coming to a place like Shanghai...

00:39:42.559 --> 00:39:43.519
can't avoid romantic affairs.

00:39:43.519 --> 00:39:45.039
Carousing and debauchery.

00:39:45.840 --> 00:39:46.320
Yes.

00:39:47.280 --> 00:39:50.760
What exactly is the envoy doing in Shanghai?

00:39:52.039 --> 00:39:53.440
The envoy came to Shanghai...

00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:54.719
but seems to have no official business.

00:39:57.639 --> 00:39:58.559
You are dismissed.

00:39:58.599 --> 00:39:59.199
Yes, sir.

00:40:16.679 --> 00:40:18.760
Connect me to the Garrison Headquarters.

00:40:20.159 --> 00:40:23.440
This is Inoue Akira of the Inoue Agency.

00:40:23.639 --> 00:40:26.840
I need to speak with Chief of Staff Yasuo Karakawa.

00:40:28.599 --> 00:40:30.559
Alright, connecting you now...

00:40:30.639 --> 00:40:32.280
Very good.

00:40:32.719 --> 00:40:34.440
Very good.

00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:35.320
Yes.

00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:44.719
This is the first one.

00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:45.679
This is the second one.

00:40:46.519 --> 00:40:47.280
I agree.

00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:49.079
Major Cheney Walker.

00:40:49.599 --> 00:40:52.679
Graduated from the Virginia Military Institute.

00:40:53.159 --> 00:40:55.599
Joined the Army Air Corps Intelligence in 1939.

00:40:56.239 --> 00:40:56.920
Right?

00:40:57.119 --> 00:40:57.639
Yes, sir.

00:40:58.719 --> 00:40:59.239
Good.

00:40:59.800 --> 00:41:00.320
Very good.

00:41:01.480 --> 00:41:03.880
The Commander has a new assignment for you.

00:41:04.679 --> 00:41:05.599
Major.

00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:07.679
You are now officially appointed as

00:41:07.679 --> 00:41:11.719
Staff Officer for Air Operations in the China Theater,

00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.679
and Air Force Assistant to General Stilwell.

00:41:14.039 --> 00:41:14.639
Yes, sir.

00:41:15.199 --> 00:41:16.079
This is only your cover identity.

00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:17.840
Your real mission

00:41:17.840 --> 00:41:18.719
Chief of Staff Harmon

00:41:18.719 --> 00:41:19.519
will brief you on immediately.

00:41:20.280 --> 00:41:21.000
Listen, Cheney.

00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:23.719
What I am about to say

00:41:24.079 --> 00:41:25.440
is top-secret.

00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:28.039
Aside from the people in this room,

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.679
including the President of the United States,

00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:33.800
you are the eleventh person to know about this.

00:41:34.880 --> 00:41:35.880
In two weeks,

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:37.519
the Pacific Fleet, with the Hornet

00:41:37.519 --> 00:41:39.079
and the Enterprise as its core,

00:41:39.079 --> 00:41:42.119
will form a composite task force.

00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:43.559
The fleet's mission

00:41:43.559 --> 00:41:44.559
is to transport one of our bomber squadrons

00:41:44.559 --> 00:41:45.880
across the entire Pacific.

00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.199
It will take eighteen days.

00:41:49.719 --> 00:41:51.639
The carriers will sail at sea

00:41:51.639 --> 00:41:54.000
to a point four hundred nautical miles off Japan's coast.

00:41:55.159 --> 00:41:55.679
Then,

00:41:56.639 --> 00:41:57.760
our bomber squadron,

00:41:57.760 --> 00:41:58.920
led by Lieutenant Colonel Jimmy Doolittle,

00:41:59.559 --> 00:42:01.599
their mission is to take off from the ships,

00:42:01.599 --> 00:42:03.320
fly to Tokyo,

00:42:04.239 --> 00:42:05.880
and carry out a bombing mission.

00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:07.920
Bomb Tokyo.

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.039
Yes.

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:11.400
Bomb Tokyo.

00:42:12.039 --> 00:42:13.679
To avenge the attack on Pearl Harbor.

00:42:13.679 --> 00:42:15.280
An eye for an eye.

00:42:16.239 --> 00:42:17.519
Sir, how is that possible?

00:42:18.519 --> 00:42:19.559
I've never heard of

00:42:19.559 --> 00:42:20.199
Army bombers

00:42:20.199 --> 00:42:21.840
taking off from Navy ships.

00:42:22.039 --> 00:42:24.239
It is indeed unprecedented and extremely risky.

00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:27.400
We want to send Japan a message:

00:42:27.679 --> 00:42:29.360
their homeland is not safe.

00:42:29.800 --> 00:42:32.119
Since the bombers cannot land on the deck,

00:42:32.559 --> 00:42:34.880
after bombing Tokyo, they must fly to China.

00:42:36.119 --> 00:42:39.159
They will land at a small airfield in China,

00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:40.920
near Quzhou.

00:42:42.239 --> 00:42:43.440
So, Cheney, your mission is

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:45.239
to get them back safely.

00:42:46.519 --> 00:42:48.079
You need to reach China

00:42:48.079 --> 00:42:49.880
before Doolittle arrives,

00:42:50.199 --> 00:42:52.400
to ensure they can land safely.

00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.760
A safe landing is the only thing

00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:56.840
that can prevent this mission

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:58.960
from being a suicide run.

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.039
The lives of the pilots

00:43:00.039 --> 00:43:00.920
are hanging by a thread.

00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:03.440
Do you understand the importance of this mission?

00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:04.599
Yes, sir.

00:43:05.239 --> 00:43:06.280
I will do everything in my power

00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:07.360
to ensure Doolittle and the pilots

00:43:07.360 --> 00:43:08.559
return safely.

00:43:09.079 --> 00:43:09.719
Sir.

00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:14.159
The radio beacon call signs and codes

00:43:14.159 --> 00:43:15.800
are all in this Bible.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:18.360
You will use these to contact Doolittle.

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:19.920
We've installed a self-destruct device in the book.

00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:21.400
You just need to pull here.

00:43:22.519 --> 00:43:24.000
There are also intelligence capsules inside, Cheney.

00:43:25.360 --> 00:43:26.800
I don't need to explain further.

00:43:27.440 --> 00:43:28.239
No need, sir.

00:43:30.880 --> 00:43:31.960
Remember,

00:43:32.199 --> 00:43:33.519
in the China Theater, only two people

00:43:33.519 --> 00:43:35.159
know about this and can help you.

00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:36.880
The Supreme Commander of the China Theater,

00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:38.079
Chiang Kai-shek,

00:43:38.239 --> 00:43:39.039
and the China Theater Chief of Staff, General Stilwell.

00:43:39.519 --> 00:43:40.159
Understood, sir.

00:43:40.639 --> 00:43:41.360
I'll remember.

00:43:42.119 --> 00:43:44.039
You should know,

00:43:44.039 --> 00:43:46.280
you are not our first "Believer."

00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.920
Your predecessor was shot down

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:50.880
while entering China via Burma.

00:43:52.239 --> 00:43:53.519
He is still missing.

00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:54.960
Yes, sir.

00:43:55.679 --> 00:43:56.480
In two hours,

00:43:56.480 --> 00:43:57.840
a plane will first take you to India.

00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.800
From India, you'll transfer to General Stilwell's location.

00:44:00.199 --> 00:44:02.239
Remember the soldier's oath.

00:44:03.880 --> 00:44:04.679
Good luck.

00:44:05.039 --> 00:44:05.639
Yes, sir.

00:44:05.719 --> 00:44:06.800
I will not let you down.

00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:09.880
Godspeed.

00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:11.320
Thank you, sir.

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:17.159
March 20, 1942.

00:44:17.559 --> 00:44:18.960
The United States War Department

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.920
dispatches the second "Believer," Cheney,

00:44:21.920 --> 00:44:26.119
to replace Witt, who is trapped on Sanzao Island.
