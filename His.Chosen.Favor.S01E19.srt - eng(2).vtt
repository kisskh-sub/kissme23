I'm Zhen'er, Sister.

Sister,

00:01:38.526 --> 00:01:40.326
I miss you so much.

00:01:40.766 --> 00:01:42.086
Don't worry.

00:01:42.086 --> 00:01:43.686
After we go out,

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:45.646
I'll open a clinic.

00:01:46.246 --> 00:01:48.366
My job's diagnosis
and yours is receiving payment.

00:01:48.366 --> 00:01:49.806
We'll make a good living.

00:01:51.286 --> 00:01:53.886
(Now I have a sister again.)

00:01:53.886 --> 00:01:56.726

Sister.

00:02:06.846 --> 00:02:08.766
(I'm sorry, Sister.)

00:02:08.766 --> 00:02:11.966
(Why did I fail to protect you
this life?)

00:02:29.926 --> 00:02:32.926
Fu An said you haven't eaten all day.

00:02:32.926 --> 00:02:34.846
I had
the imperial kitchen prepare pastries.

00:02:34.846 --> 00:02:35.846
Have some.

00:02:39.286 --> 00:02:40.646
Found the killer?

00:02:48.766 --> 00:02:49.686
Not yet.

00:02:54.846 --> 00:02:55.766
Lu Zhen'er,

00:02:56.846 --> 00:02:57.766
I know Yindan's death

00:02:57.766 --> 00:02:58.886
has devastated you.

00:02:59.926 --> 00:03:01.446
But you must eat.

00:03:02.326 --> 00:03:04.246
Or else you'll wear yourself out.

00:03:10.966 --> 00:03:11.966
Zhen'er,

00:03:12.006 --> 00:03:13.726
those who are still alive

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:15.566
must live well.

00:03:20.006 --> 00:03:21.326
Xiao Wenjing,

00:03:21.326 --> 00:03:23.166
I remember you told me

00:03:23.166 --> 00:03:24.886
that if I die,

00:03:24.886 --> 00:03:27.086
the world's storyline will be reset

00:03:27.086 --> 00:03:28.406
and you can go home.

00:03:31.206 --> 00:03:32.446
What are you planning?

00:03:33.406 --> 00:03:34.046
I want

00:03:35.526 --> 00:03:37.166
to exchange my life

00:03:37.166 --> 00:03:39.006
for yours.

00:03:39.006 --> 00:03:40.206
I'm begging

00:03:40.526 --> 00:03:42.486
for one more lifetime.

00:03:43.806 --> 00:03:45.166
You want me to die?

00:03:46.166 --> 00:03:48.046
Once you die,

00:03:48.046 --> 00:03:50.286
the world's storyline will be reset

00:03:50.286 --> 00:03:52.406
and everything returns to the beginning.

00:03:53.246 --> 00:03:55.086
My sister

00:03:55.086 --> 00:03:56.926
can return safely then.

00:03:57.366 --> 00:03:58.126
Impossible.

00:03:58.686 --> 00:04:00.446
I won't let your death be in vain.

00:04:00.886 --> 00:04:03.166
After we recognize each other next time,

00:04:03.166 --> 00:04:05.126
tell me the truth immediately.

00:04:05.126 --> 00:04:07.126
Once I see my sister's face,

00:04:07.126 --> 00:04:08.326
I'll believe you.

00:04:09.086 --> 00:04:11.126
After I send her
out of the palace safely,

00:04:11.806 --> 00:04:13.046
I'll die for you.

00:04:14.486 --> 00:04:16.726
I'll take you away from this world.

00:04:18.046 --> 00:04:19.846
Consider it my repayment to you.

00:04:20.526 --> 00:04:21.526
Absolutely not.

00:04:22.766 --> 00:04:23.726
Why?

00:04:24.446 --> 00:04:25.606
If you die,

00:04:26.446 --> 00:04:28.606
the world's storyline will be reset.

00:04:28.606 --> 00:04:30.326
All your memories will vanish.

00:04:30.326 --> 00:04:30.966
Next time,

00:04:30.966 --> 00:04:32.526
you won't remember me at all.

00:04:33.046 --> 00:04:34.246
So what?

00:04:34.246 --> 00:04:35.366
I'll trust you.

00:04:35.526 --> 00:04:37.086
I need more than that.

00:04:37.726 --> 00:04:38.446
Lu Zhen'er,

00:04:39.606 --> 00:04:41.286
you have someone to protect.

00:04:41.286 --> 00:04:43.166
I also have mine to protect.

00:04:43.166 --> 00:04:44.046
Don't be so selfish

00:04:44.046 --> 00:04:46.246
as to make me abandon the one I protect.

00:04:47.166 --> 00:04:49.286
But we're from different worlds.

00:04:49.286 --> 00:04:50.526
We're destined to part.

00:04:50.526 --> 00:04:53.446
We're in the same world now.

00:04:53.446 --> 00:04:56.366
Xiao Wenjing, don't you want to go home?

00:05:03.326 --> 00:05:06.326
There's someone I cherish here.

00:05:09.926 --> 00:05:11.366
Next time, I'll still be the same.

00:05:11.366 --> 00:05:13.126
What are you afraid of?

00:05:17.006 --> 00:05:18.566
I'm afraid of that hearts change easily

00:05:20.726 --> 00:05:22.406
and life is unpredictable.

00:05:23.926 --> 00:05:24.726
But

00:05:26.366 --> 00:05:28.446
I promised my sister

00:05:28.926 --> 00:05:31.406
I'd protect her.

00:05:33.206 --> 00:05:35.166
I promised her,

00:05:36.566 --> 00:05:38.646
yet I let her die.

00:06:08.286 --> 00:06:09.366
Next time,

00:06:09.366 --> 00:06:11.046
do we have a recognition code?

00:06:11.606 --> 00:06:13.126
You responded perfectly this time.

00:06:13.926 --> 00:06:17.126
Nice to meet you.

00:06:19.446 --> 00:06:22.046
