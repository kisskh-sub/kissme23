00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:03.810
(Episode 9)

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.310
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:13.420
Suk Hee...

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.150
Be careful! Oh my.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:20.160
Are you okay? Here, get up.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:22.430
All right. Oh, dear. That must hurt.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.800
Jung Suk Hee...

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.370
It really is Jung Suk Hee!

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.730
- I'm okay.
- Are you sure?

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:30.800
Yes, that's right.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:33.300
There's no doubt it's her.

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:36.470
How can this be?

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:40.380
How is Jung Suk Hee still alive?

00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:43.050
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.280
But something's different about her.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.150
Did she hit her head?

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:52.360
Let's go.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.590
Here, let me take that.

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.400
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:24.260
Right. The guitar!

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:26.290
Where is my head?

00:01:29.030 --> 00:01:30.330
(Four Missed Calls, Pervert Guitarist)

00:01:31.630 --> 00:01:34.170
This guy couldn't even wait
and called me yesterday.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.510
Lawyer Kang, I heard you won the case.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:41.640
Of course I did, Mom.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:44.510
And you got a nice, fat bonus
this time, right?

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.150
- About that...
- Not again!

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.480
You not only waived the bonus,
but you cut the legal fees too?

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:55.590
Mom, I felt bad for her.
Her child is still so young.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.990
It seemed she could barely make ends meet
with the alimony.

00:01:59.090 --> 00:02:01.030
Kang Baek Ho! Lawyer Kang!

00:02:01.430 --> 00:02:02.860
Snap out of it!

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.000
We're not running a charity here!

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:07.670
If you give in to every sob story,
what happens to us?

00:02:08.770 --> 00:02:11.870
We’re barely managing rent
and payroll as it is.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.770
Yes, I know.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:15.810
My alumni reunion's coming up.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.180
I'll go and really hustle
for some new clients.

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.010
Gosh, I can't tell if you're naive
or just a pushover.

00:02:22.110 --> 00:02:25.280
How do you expect to survive
in this dog-eat-dog world?

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:27.590
As your mother, I'm truly worried.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:29.920
I'm leaving.

00:02:31.260 --> 00:02:32.320
Okay, take care.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.030
Goodness, honestly.

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.700
(Guitar Jerk)

00:02:41.530 --> 00:02:44.140
- Hello?
- I see you called yesterday.

00:02:44.140 --> 00:02:47.540
Don't think I'm a deadbeat.
I have no intention of stiffing you.

00:02:47.610 --> 00:02:49.410
Then why did you ignore my calls?

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.910
I was too busy to take it.

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.340
That's why I'm calling you now, right?

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.310
You have no right to give me
that attitude, you know?

00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:57.620
You should be groveling for forgiveness.

00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:00.690
Don't treat me like a criminal.

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:03.290
I told you I'm not trying to stiff you.

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:07.530
Fine. So how are you going to pay
for my guitar?

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:11.030
I'm planning to consult a lawyer about it.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:13.330
- A lawyer?
- Would it be wrong to?

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:15.400
It's not like it's completely unusable.

00:03:15.500 --> 00:03:19.540
It's ridiculous to pay
the full amount you asked for.

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:22.140
Does he take me for a pushover?

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:23.510
And?

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:27.950
I'll call you after I've consulted
with my lawyer, so just wait.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:31.680
Look, you really are clueless, aren't you?

00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:35.150
Do you have any idea how much it costs
for one consultation with a lawyer?

00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.590
You don't have to worry about that.

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:39.360
Is that so?

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:43.700
Let me save you the consultation fee
and tell you myself...

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.170
I'm good!
I'll call you later, so just wait.

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:50.600
Hello? Hey!

00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:54.570
This woman is unbelievable.

00:03:55.570 --> 00:03:58.480
I'm a lawyer. Who is she going to ask?

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:11.790
- Suk Hee.
- Chocolate.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.830
This will give you cavities.

00:04:13.930 --> 00:04:17.230
It's not good for you,
so let's get it next time, okay?

00:04:17.930 --> 00:04:21.800
But it's yummy. Suk Hee likes chocolate.

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:26.070
All right, just for today, then.
No more tomorrow, okay?

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:28.410
- Okay.
- Promise.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:31.180
Promise. Pinky swear.

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.180
- There.
- Pinky swear.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:34.880
Okay, Suk Hee, let's go now.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:37.650
What? She has the mind of a child.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:42.320
Then again, after falling off a cliff,
it would be weirder if she were unharmed.

00:04:42.390 --> 00:04:44.790
You shouldn't do that.
Come on, we have to go now.

00:04:46.860 --> 00:04:48.630
Then what about
the other child Jung Suk Hee had?

00:04:49.690 --> 00:04:51.000
What happened to her?

00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:08.150
- Hey, Tae Pyung!
- Hey, Jang Mi.

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:11.150
I can't make deliveries today.

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:12.550
No, it's not that.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.850
Didn't you say you have a friend
who's a lawyer?

00:05:15.850 --> 00:05:16.950
A lawyer?

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:19.260
Yes, I do.
He's a really good friend of mine.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:22.630
- Why do you ask?
- I need to ask for some advice,

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:23.930
so could you set something up for me?

00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.900
Really?
Of course. That's no problem at all.

00:05:27.430 --> 00:05:29.670
Let me tell you. He's got a heart of gold.

00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.240
He can't stand to see people struggling.

00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.340
- Really?
- As a matter of fact,

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.040
I've already told him a lot about you,
so he'll be happy to help.

00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:40.810
Ask him anything.

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.180
- I'll hook you up.
- Perfect. Thanks, Tae Pyung.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.320
(Law Firm Leeho)

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:51.720
(Lawyer Kang Baek Ho)

00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.560
Hey, Tae Pyung.
I was just about to call you, actually.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:57.360
How did things go at the police station?

00:05:57.360 --> 00:05:58.760
It's all taken care of.

00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:01.800
- That's a relief.
- Anyway,

00:06:01.970 --> 00:06:04.240
my sister wanted to ask you something.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:05.440
Do you have a minute?

00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:07.540
You mean that pretty sister of yours?

00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:10.040
Hey, for her? Of course I do.

00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.010
Go on, ask him.

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:17.750
Hey...

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.580
Gosh.

00:06:20.950 --> 00:06:22.450
Why couldn't she just talk to him here?

00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:25.460
Is it something I'm not supposed to hear?

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.530
Hello.

00:06:27.830 --> 00:06:31.760
I've heard so much about you
from my brother, Tae Pyung.

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:33.930
I was hoping I could ask you
a few questions.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:37.440
I know you're busy,
so I won't take up too much of your time.

00:06:37.500 --> 00:06:38.970
It's no problem at all.

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:41.310
What kind of problem are you having?

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.940
I'll be happy to answer as best as I can.

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:46.840
I think I might have...

00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:48.480
accidentally damaged someone's property.

00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:53.650
But just a tiny little bit.

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:55.150
Someone's property?

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:08.330
Knock, knock.

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:18.580
Under Article 750 of the Civil Code,
if you damage another person's property,

00:07:18.780 --> 00:07:20.880
you are indeed liable for damages.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:22.380
How much would I be liable for?

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:26.080
Don't tell me I have to cover all of it.

00:07:26.080 --> 00:07:27.220
Let's see.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.690
If it's repairable,
then probably just the cost of repairs.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:31.920
Did you happen to scratch a luxury car?

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:33.620
No, it's not that.

00:07:34.330 --> 00:07:36.490
I just need to cover
the cost of repairs, right?

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:41.270
But the other party is demanding
an outrageous amount of compensation.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:43.670
That's why I couldn't just stand for it...

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:46.600
and decided to seek your legal advice.

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.270
It wasn't intentional, was it?

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:50.140
Property damage is a criminal offense.

00:07:50.140 --> 00:07:52.080
Of course not! It was an accident.

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:53.240
Gosh, my ears.

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:55.750
Her voice sounds really familiar.

00:07:57.150 --> 00:07:59.250
It's a huge relief
that it wasn't intentional.

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:03.350
If you'd like a detailed consultation,
please feel free to stop by the office.

00:08:03.650 --> 00:08:06.320
Since you're Tae Pyung's sister,
I'll give you an in-depth consultation.

00:08:09.590 --> 00:08:13.800
I will. Thank you so much.

00:08:14.070 --> 00:08:17.030
All right then. Goodbye.

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:23.910
I just have to cover the repair costs.
That's it.

00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:26.680
Wait a minute.

00:08:29.010 --> 00:08:30.780
(Oh Jang Mi: 543.21 dollars)

00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:33.950
I put most of it into the house and shop,
so I barely have anything left.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:35.450
What am I going to do?

00:08:41.690 --> 00:08:45.300
Hey, something urgent came up,
and I'm in a bit of a jam.

00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:47.370
Do you know if there are
any part-time jobs available?

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:48.830
(Law Firm Leeho)

00:08:48.830 --> 00:08:51.800
Why does her voice sound so familiar?

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.240
Could I have met
Tae Pyung's sister before?

00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:57.340
No, that can't be it.

00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.340
I heard she has a beautiful name,
Jang Mi.

00:08:59.340 --> 00:09:00.710
There's no way I've met her.

00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:02.280
Right.

00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:04.220
So...

00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:07.850
are you here to check up on me
and see if the event prep is going well?

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:11.420
What are you talking about?
I'm the one who brought you on board.

00:09:11.890 --> 00:09:13.360
You'd better not forget it.

00:09:14.190 --> 00:09:16.490
Gosh, you're so cynical and uptight.

00:09:17.530 --> 00:09:20.060
Then again,
I guess that's part of your charm.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:21.630
Cut the nonsense.

00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:24.140
Tell me why you're here.

00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.940
I heard CEO Chae isn't happy with you.

00:09:29.510 --> 00:09:32.310
And that she challenged you
to double sales in two months?

00:09:34.810 --> 00:09:37.850
She's probably trying to push you out
because I'm the one who recommended you.

00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.720
Because you're not one of her people.

00:09:39.880 --> 00:09:41.250
You came here
because you were worried about me?

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:43.820
Hardly. I have faith in you.

00:09:44.520 --> 00:09:46.820
In fact, I'm sure I'll get a promotion,
thanks to you.

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:50.130
I'm glad we're on the same page.

00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:54.100
But about Seo Rin...

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:58.070
It seems like
she has been hitting on you.

00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.240
You don't need to concern yourself
with that.

00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:13.450
- Grandpa!
- Hey there, kiddo.

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.820
You're not at the office today?

00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:18.090
I skipped it to hang out
with you, Grandpa.

00:10:19.690 --> 00:10:21.160
Don't tell me you're doing boring work.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:24.730
Some things have to be done,
even if they're not fun, you know?

00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:26.700
By the way, Seo Rin.

00:10:26.900 --> 00:10:29.400
Do you have a crush on someone?

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:30.800
A crush?

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:34.510
You're my number one guy, Grandpa.

00:10:34.510 --> 00:10:35.670
There is no one besides you.

00:10:35.770 --> 00:10:39.940
I heard you liked that chef
at Chang Restaurant...

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:41.850
and that rumors about it
are all over the company.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:45.150
That?

00:10:47.590 --> 00:10:49.050
Yes, that's right.

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:52.890
Grandpa, I've finally found a guy
I really like.

00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:54.430
Is that right?

00:10:56.090 --> 00:11:00.430
Who's this guy
who stole your heart just like that?

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:02.470
Curious, aren't you?

00:11:03.070 --> 00:11:05.700
I'm really curious about him too.

00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:08.470
A mysterious man is more attractive.

00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:09.510
Right, Grandpa?

00:11:09.570 --> 00:11:10.740
That's right.

00:11:11.040 --> 00:11:12.810
I'm curious too.

00:11:12.940 --> 00:11:14.010
Should I bring him home to meet you?

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.410
No, that's all right.

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:17.420
The more mysterious a guy is,

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.820
half the fun is getting to know him
little by little, right?

00:11:22.050 --> 00:11:23.490
Don't rush things.

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:26.020
Just enjoy the mystery for all its worth.

00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.330
You think so?

00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.560
And don't let on to your mother.

00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:32.900
I have a feeling your mom...

00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:35.900
won't be happy
if she finds out you're seeing someone.

00:11:36.770 --> 00:11:37.800
You're right.

00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:40.200
Grandpa, you're really...

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:42.410
in my corner.

00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:44.780
Silly girl.

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.210
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:11:49.310 --> 00:11:51.620
- You wanted to see me?
- Jung Suk Hee is alive.

00:11:53.180 --> 00:11:54.550
- What?
- Why do I have to repeat myself?

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.190
Jung Suk Hee is alive!

00:11:57.150 --> 00:11:58.860
I always had a bad feeling
since we never found a body.

00:11:58.860 --> 00:11:59.920
And now this.

00:12:00.830 --> 00:12:01.830
That's impossible.

00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:04.230
If Jung Suk Hee is really alive,

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:07.030
why hasn't she gone to the police by now?

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:10.130
Her child was taken from her.
How could she stay silent after that?

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:12.870
That's my point.
The impossible has happened.

00:12:13.170 --> 00:12:15.210
That's what you need to find out for me.

00:12:17.110 --> 00:12:18.940
The accident might have messed
with her head.

00:12:19.340 --> 00:12:20.850
She didn't seem normal.

00:12:22.380 --> 00:12:23.380
Her head?

00:12:24.750 --> 00:12:27.850
- What on earth are you talking about?
- I saw her clearly with my own two eyes.

00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.020
So you go and confirm it for yourself.
Find out what's going on.

00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:36.530
Most importantly,
find out about her family situation.

00:12:39.530 --> 00:12:41.330
Jung Suk Hee should have died.

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.170
Her being alive...

00:12:43.970 --> 00:12:46.470
means she could come for our throats
at any moment.

00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:55.150
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:13:16.030 --> 00:13:18.970
Oh, goodness. We've got a customer!

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.270
Go on, take your pick.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:26.180
We have seasoned vegetables, chicken soup,
braised mackerel, braised lotus root,

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.410
stir-fried fish cakes,
and a spicy bellflower and cucumber salad.

00:13:32.550 --> 00:13:33.550
Let go of me!

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.490
Let go of me! I said, let go, you jerks!

00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:46.990
Suk Hee!

00:14:48.590 --> 00:14:49.760
Suk Hee, over here. This way.

00:14:50.330 --> 00:14:53.130
- I'm so sorry, sir.
- No, don't worry.

00:14:53.400 --> 00:14:55.470
Suk Hee didn't do anything wrong.

00:14:55.470 --> 00:14:57.640
I'm terribly sorry if we startled you.

00:14:58.540 --> 00:14:59.540
It's quite all right.

00:14:59.870 --> 00:15:01.470
The customer's leaving.

00:15:01.470 --> 00:15:02.810
- Suk Hee.
- Mister, come back!

00:15:02.810 --> 00:15:03.810
- Suk Hee.
- Hey, mister!

00:15:03.810 --> 00:15:06.810
Suk Hee, it's not your fault, okay?
It's okay.

00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:10.310
It's okay. Now, let's go.

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:18.220
No way.

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:20.920
That was definitely Jung Suk Hee.

00:15:22.590 --> 00:15:24.430
How could she have possibly survived that?

00:15:26.230 --> 00:15:29.670
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:15:35.910 --> 00:15:37.710
- Yes, boss.
- It's me.

00:15:38.340 --> 00:15:39.880
I need you to look into something for me.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:42.050
I don't have much time,
so do it as soon as you can.

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:51.690
Right. I heard Chef Kang Jun Ho
is at Chang Restaurant now.

00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.260
Really? You mean the celebrity chef,
Kang Jun Ho?

00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:57.960
Where did you say Chef Kang Jun Ho went?

00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:00.100
Oh Jang Mi,
are you a fan of Chef Kang Jun Ho, too?

00:16:00.260 --> 00:16:01.830
A fan? I'm his biggest fan!

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.440
He's the one who earned
three Michelin stars in New York.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:06.900
My biggest wish is to meet...

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.410
that famous and amazing
Chef Kang Jun Ho just once.

00:16:09.470 --> 00:16:10.510
If that's the case,

00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.310
you can see him at Chang Restaurant
in the Dream Hotel.

00:16:13.610 --> 00:16:15.350
I heard he's the new head chef there...

00:16:15.350 --> 00:16:16.810
and just got back from the States.

00:16:17.080 --> 00:16:19.220
Gosh, really?

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:22.120
Chang Restaurant.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.370
You wanted to see me?

00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:38.000
Was there a problem with your meal?

00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:42.610
If you try to get close to Seo Rin
to get ahead,

00:16:43.140 --> 00:16:45.010
you'd better think again.

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:49.750
This is no laughing matter.

00:16:50.610 --> 00:16:52.550
Your career here is on a two-month clock,
Chef Kang.

00:16:53.080 --> 00:16:56.590
I see you're in a hurry
to ride on Seo Rin's coattails.

00:16:56.650 --> 00:16:58.620
Director Ma also had
a crude way with words.

00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:02.630
I suppose it's true that
daughters take after their mothers.

00:17:02.930 --> 00:17:05.360
- Crude?
- My standards aren't that low.

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:08.000
If that's your concern,
you have nothing to worry about.

00:17:08.330 --> 00:17:10.200
- What was that?
- If there's nothing else...

00:17:18.440 --> 00:17:19.840
That arrogant brat.

00:17:28.550 --> 00:17:29.550
Manager Lee.

00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:38.760
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:41.300
What's the story?

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:42.900
Did you look into everything?

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:45.300
Yes. As you saw for yourself,

00:17:45.570 --> 00:17:47.810
it seems the accident caused her
to lose all her memories.

00:17:48.970 --> 00:17:50.340
She lost her memories?

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:54.950
- Enjoy your meal.
- Enjoy your meal.

00:17:58.320 --> 00:17:59.320
We made a sale!

00:18:04.050 --> 00:18:06.790
Yes! There we go.

00:18:07.990 --> 00:18:09.030
Due to that accident,

00:18:09.430 --> 00:18:12.000
it appears Jung Suk Hee has regressed
to the mental age of a five-year-old.

00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:16.130
And so, she appears to have no memory
of that time whatsoever.

00:18:16.300 --> 00:18:17.800
How can you be so sure of that?

00:18:18.540 --> 00:18:20.670
Couldn't her memory come back at any time?

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:30.410
The person you're calling is unavailable.

00:18:30.410 --> 00:18:31.820
Connecting to voicemail...

00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:33.150
She's not picking up?

00:18:33.550 --> 00:18:34.550
No.

00:18:34.890 --> 00:18:37.320
CEO Chae must be busy.
She's not picking up.

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.620
She asked for
the family relationship certificate,

00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:40.690
so I did.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:42.590
But it doesn't look like
I'll see her today.

00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:45.260
Why did she ask for
a family relationship certificate?

00:18:45.730 --> 00:18:47.400
We were wondering the same thing.

00:18:56.840 --> 00:18:58.540
You're back
from your part-time work already?

00:18:58.540 --> 00:19:01.080
You should be resting.
What are you doing in the kitchen?

00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.910
Because it's hard doing it alone, Dad.

00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:05.320
Your mom is a great cook
when it comes to side dishes.

00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.450
All I do is sell.

00:19:07.650 --> 00:19:08.890
Do I need to go grocery shopping?

00:19:09.320 --> 00:19:11.590
Hey, Tae Pyung.
Let's make gimbap tomorrow.

00:19:11.590 --> 00:19:13.090
Grab the ingredients for it, okay?

00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:15.390
- Gimbap?
- We're supposed to visit the villa...

00:19:15.390 --> 00:19:17.130
where your mom had her accident tomorrow.

00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.060
That's right.

00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:22.500
It comes around so fast every year.

00:19:23.030 --> 00:19:24.470
It's that time of year again.

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.850
Hello, CEO Chae.

00:19:41.790 --> 00:19:42.790
And you are?

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:45.820
I'm handling the design
for the Dream Hotel's renovation.

00:19:46.090 --> 00:19:47.260
I'm Kang Nam Bong.

00:19:47.790 --> 00:19:50.860
Yes, Professor Kang.
I've heard a lot about you.

00:19:51.190 --> 00:19:53.760
I apologize.
I should've introduced myself first.

00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.030
Not at all.

00:19:55.030 --> 00:19:57.830
Why don't you start
by speaking with my team?

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.970
But it's at the stage
where it requires your final approval.

00:20:00.970 --> 00:20:02.840
I'm sorry, but I'm a bit busy today.

00:20:03.040 --> 00:20:04.780
I appreciate you coming all this way,

00:20:05.010 --> 00:20:06.310
but we'll have to make the decision
another time.

00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:07.980
Yes, I see.

00:20:17.490 --> 00:20:19.720
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:23.730
- Tae Pyung, I want to go too.
- Mom, you should stay inside.

00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:27.200
- I want to go to the market too.
- Just stay inside with Dad.

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:29.370
- Okay, let's go.
- Suk Hee.

00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.770
- Hold his hand tight and don't lose him.
- Okay.

00:20:34.070 --> 00:20:35.770
- We're off.
- Okay.

00:20:37.410 --> 00:20:38.640
Oh Bok Gil.

00:20:38.640 --> 00:20:40.510
He grew up with Jung Suk Hee
in an orphanage.

00:20:40.740 --> 00:20:44.210
They were as close as siblings,
but lost touch after he married.

00:20:44.850 --> 00:20:47.220
His wife passed away from an illness
after having two children.

00:20:47.780 --> 00:20:49.550
He married Jung Suk Hee
after her accident,

00:20:49.550 --> 00:20:51.220
and they have a daughter.

00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:52.520
So...

00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:55.430
he doesn't know a thing, right?

00:20:56.490 --> 00:20:57.630
Yes, that seems to be the case.

00:20:58.400 --> 00:20:59.430
That makes sense.

00:21:00.230 --> 00:21:02.900
That explains why
he's done nothing all this time.

00:21:16.550 --> 00:21:19.920
Your mom ended up following Tae Pyung
to the market after all.

00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:24.120
I guess Tae Pyung reminds Mom of you
when you were young.

00:21:24.250 --> 00:21:27.420
Tae Pyung is my spitting image.

00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.630
I guess that's why I'm so pretty
since I take after you too.

00:21:31.730 --> 00:21:32.800
What?

00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:34.970
Right.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:53.850
Jung Suk Hee...

00:21:54.620 --> 00:21:56.590
What am I going to do
if she gets her memory back?

00:21:57.490 --> 00:21:58.890
It's possible, isn't it?

00:21:59.590 --> 00:22:00.590
It's hard to say.

00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:05.060
Since her brain damage made her regress
to the mental age of a five-year-old,

00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.900
it's highly unlikely.

00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:10.070
But she could have surgery or something
and be perfectly fine again, right?

00:22:10.300 --> 00:22:11.700
I'd have to look into it,

00:22:12.340 --> 00:22:14.940
- but I'd say the odds are against it.
- The odds are against it?

00:22:15.010 --> 00:22:17.110
(CEO Chae Hwa Young)

00:22:17.170 --> 00:22:21.380
So since she's lost her mind,
she'll never remember me or the accident.

00:22:21.450 --> 00:22:23.380
So I should just relax?
Is that what you're telling me?

00:22:24.380 --> 00:22:25.650
For now,

00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:28.120
I've assigned one of my best men to it,

00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.090
so if things start to get dangerous,
I'll step in myself.

00:22:31.150 --> 00:22:32.560
Of course you will.

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:37.260
This is all because you messed up
in the first place.

00:22:37.990 --> 00:22:40.000
Who would have thought
Jung Suk Hee would survive?

00:22:40.760 --> 00:22:41.870
I apologize.

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:45.340
What about the other twin from back then?

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:47.340
Are you sure that one died?

00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:49.510
They never found the body.

00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:51.510
What if that one is still alive, too?

00:22:52.280 --> 00:22:55.180
Impossible. There's absolutely no way.

00:22:55.850 --> 00:22:57.880
Jung Suk Hee may've been lucky to survive,

00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.220
but that was a newborn baby,
only a few days old.

00:23:10.630 --> 00:23:13.430
A baby that young fell off a cliff
into the river.

00:23:14.030 --> 00:23:15.400
How could she possibly have survived?

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:21.200
That's just not possible,
so you don't need to worry.

00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:23.470
And what about Jung Suk Hee's family?

00:23:24.070 --> 00:23:26.580
- Did you look into them?
- Like I said before,

00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:29.810
Oh Bok Gil already had a son
and a daughter with his first wife.

00:23:30.150 --> 00:23:32.180
He seems to have remarried Jung Suk Hee
and had another daughter with her.

00:23:32.980 --> 00:23:36.050
Her name is Oh Jang Mi.
She's a year younger than Seo Rin.

00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:38.660
Oh Jang Mi...

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:40.820
If she's a year younger,

00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:43.760
it means Jung Suk Hee got pregnant
right after the accident.

00:23:45.330 --> 00:23:47.330
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:23:53.970 --> 00:23:55.770
- Hop in.
- Okay.

00:23:56.070 --> 00:23:57.110
Suk Hee, get in.

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:00.440
Scoot in. Where's Tae Pyung?

00:24:01.310 --> 00:24:04.550
He said he couldn't go.
Apparently, someone needed to see him.

00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:08.290
Does he think he's a businessman?
Who is he always meeting?

00:24:08.290 --> 00:24:11.620
Tae Pyung is busy.
Tae Pyung is a good singer.

00:24:13.890 --> 00:24:18.230
Dad, let's check on the banner
before we head to the villa.

00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:20.000
All right. Let's go check it out.

00:24:21.930 --> 00:24:24.270
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:24:34.880 --> 00:24:37.710
Lawyer Kang said he'd be here,
but he's late.

00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.820
Where is he?

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:43.490
Good afternoon, ma'am.

00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:46.020
It's an honor to see you again.

00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:48.160
Come in.

00:24:56.230 --> 00:24:57.970
- Have a seat.
- Yes, ma'am.

00:24:58.440 --> 00:25:00.140
You brought your family documents, right?

00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:01.470
Pardon?

00:25:01.470 --> 00:25:04.440
I gave them to President Hwang
at the agency yesterday.

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:07.580
You must not have gotten them yet.

00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:09.710
So you left them at the agency?

00:25:09.780 --> 00:25:12.620
I can call and have them sent over.
Or I could run...

00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:13.680
Don't bother.

00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:17.750
I'm so sorry, ma'am.
I should've given them to you directly...

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:19.060
I said, don't bother.

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:23.130
So, tell me about your family again.

00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.330
There's my father and mother,

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.970
my older sister who lives in Vietnam
with her husband, a businessman,

00:25:29.030 --> 00:25:31.270
and then there is
me and my younger sister.

00:25:31.270 --> 00:25:32.940
We're a happy family of four.

00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:35.170
- A happy family?
- Yes.

00:25:35.510 --> 00:25:38.010
My mom makes amazing side dishes.

00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.610
So my parents run a side dish shop.

00:25:40.610 --> 00:25:42.680
Today is their day off,
so we were supposed to pack gimbap...

00:25:42.750 --> 00:25:44.750
and go to our villa as a family.

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:47.080
A villa?

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:49.490
- I'm sorry
- I'm sorry

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:52.620
- I'm sorry
- I'm sorry

00:25:52.690 --> 00:25:56.730
- I'm sorry to leave you behind
- I'm sorry to leave you behind

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:00.300
Those beautiful days,
those happy memories

00:26:00.300 --> 00:26:02.030
- It's all over now
- It's all over now

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:04.830
You sound great!

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.000
- Hurry up and get on your feet
- Now it's all

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:11.210
To be honest, my mom...

00:26:12.180 --> 00:26:14.340
suffered a head injury in an accident.

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:17.250
And today is the anniversary
of that accident.

00:26:17.650 --> 00:26:21.450
That's why they want to visit
the villa my dad found a long time ago.

00:26:22.050 --> 00:26:24.890
The thing is, my mom used to be brilliant.

00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.720
She even passed the bar's first round.

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.160
She must've studied for it at the villa.

00:26:29.230 --> 00:26:31.700
Where did you say they're going?
Where is this villa?

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:33.060
Sorry?

00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.030
It's a villa in Taean.

00:26:36.530 --> 00:26:37.670
We go there every year...

00:26:37.670 --> 00:26:40.370
to try to find out
who was responsible for my mom's injury.

00:26:43.170 --> 00:26:44.910
We've been doing it
since I was just a kid,

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:46.980
so it's been decades now.

00:26:58.920 --> 00:27:01.190
- In search of happiness
- In search of happiness

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:03.260
In search of happiness

00:27:03.630 --> 00:27:07.600
- I must go far away
- I must go far away

00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.620
(The First Man)

00:27:34.690 --> 00:27:35.830
What are you going to do about it?

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:38.030
Jung Suk Hee is on her way to the villa...

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:39.560
with her entire family.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:42.030
Ssangkal.
Call me the second anything happens.

00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:43.630
You need to pay for that scarf.

00:27:43.630 --> 00:27:44.730
Do you have any idea who I am?

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:46.370
- Then I'll have to call the police.
- Seo Rin.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:48.610
Did you pick out your gift?

00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:51.310
I refuse to lose anything. Ever.

00:27:51.540 --> 00:27:54.840
Mom. Do you feel anything?

00:27:59.080 --> 00:28:01.080
