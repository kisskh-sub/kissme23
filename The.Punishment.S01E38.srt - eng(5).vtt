[Longwan Village, Hanzhou City, 2001]

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:16.170
You've put it on.

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.560
How do I look?

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:19.970
Great. You look smart in it.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:20.980
Is it too short?

00:00:20.980 --> 00:00:22.870
Not at all. Jiangyan made a good pick.

00:00:22.870 --> 00:00:23.550
I look spirited this way.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:24.640
It'll work perfectly

00:00:24.640 --> 00:00:26.030
for my business meeting today.

00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:28.560
You should also wear it
outside of business meetings.

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.160
This is an expensive jacket.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:32.880
I'd rather save it
for important occasions.

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.640
I'll buy you a few more
so you can rotate them for daily wear.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:35.350
Are you rich now?

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:35.960
Feng!

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.130
Perfect timing.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:42.240
You both look sharp.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:43.200
Let me take a photo of you two.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:43.750
Okay.

00:00:43.750 --> 00:00:45.280
Where did you get this camera?

00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:46.540
Crazy bought it for me.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:48.880
It cost him half of his salary.

00:00:49.150 --> 00:00:51.200
The major part of the rest
went to your jacket,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.200
and what little was left
to an outfit for Mom.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.280
This month was a total wash for him.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:54.920
That's fine.

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.240
Try to be more frugal with your money.

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:57.520
Couldn't you have saved some up?

00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.200
I'll receive a salary again next month.
What's there to worry about?

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.030
You should've saved some up.
Just listen to me.

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:02.200
But what was the point?

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:03.030
-Hurry.
-You can't go on in this way.

00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:04.510
-Time for a photo.
-Come on. Look at the camera.

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:06.790
The purchase has been made anyway.
Might as well take a photo.

00:01:06.790 --> 00:01:08.680
Three, two, one.

00:01:11.680 --> 00:01:13.690
Tianye, can you look more cheerful?

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.950
Try another pose.

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:16.730
Okay. Let's try another pose.

00:01:18.840 --> 00:01:19.710
With you in that uniform...

00:01:19.710 --> 00:01:21.440
this posture seems a bit weird.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:23.039
Alright.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:23.950
Try another one.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:24.510
Another one?

00:01:24.510 --> 00:01:25.870
Here comes my signature pose.

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:26.930
You... Seriously?

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:29.230
Officer, I'm an honest businessman.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:30.840

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.380
Tianye said he'd stay.

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.060
Then I'll stay too.

00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:15.630
I plan to turn myself in.

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:26.460
Let me take the fall instead.

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.630
Tianfei,

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.540
you're not connected to Tianyun.

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.050
Only I am the chairman of it.

00:03:35.550 --> 00:03:36.150
Then...

00:03:36.590 --> 00:03:37.520
Why not tell the police

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:39.720
that I forced you to do all those crimes?

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:42.829
I didn't say much to you before.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.940
But now I hope
you'll pull yourself together

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:48.180
and help Tianye.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.240
Make sure you stay to the very end

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.100
and accompany Tianye till all is over,
okay?

00:04:08.890 --> 00:04:10.440
Bo, take a break.

00:04:11.510 --> 00:04:12.240
I'm all good.

00:04:23.510 --> 00:04:24.600
Shall I tidy it up? Seems too messy.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.800
Put the goods in order then.

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:26.410
Okay.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:33.920
I'll take it out for you, alright?

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:34.560
Okay.

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:36.950
Just put it there.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:37.510
Got it.

00:05:35.409 --> 00:05:36.690
Ding Baoshuai is dead.

00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:39.130
Qin Taoyi has turned himself in.

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:43.680
This is your last chance.

00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:47.620

00:05:48.220 --> 00:05:49.200

What are you going to do?

00:05:57.159 --> 00:05:59.220
I'll take down the targets one by one,

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:01.270
starting with Guazi,

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:03.480
and then Zhang Xin.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:06.980
You know how to, right?

00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:14.800
Previously,

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:16.570
we investigated Guazi.

00:06:17.710 --> 00:06:19.240
He's from Shuikou Village.

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.630
There was

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:22.560
a poisoning case there.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:25.000
The suspect was a man

00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:26.510
named Xiong Chao.

00:06:27.390 --> 00:06:28.950
You can look into it.

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:33.090
You know about Meng Yu, right?

00:06:33.240 --> 00:06:34.190
Where is she now?

00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:47.390
I don't know this woman
you're looking for,

00:06:47.390 --> 00:06:48.520
but this might help.

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.870
It was left by Ma Jin.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:08.360
I guess what's written
is some bank accounts and codes.

00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:09.070
Anyway,

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.870
they must be related
to Hong Mushou's dirty stuff.

00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.690
I'll let you know when I have a finding.

00:07:26.070 --> 00:07:26.830
Feng.

00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.490
After taking them down,

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:33.760
what will you do?

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:37.240
Then I'll have to deal with you.

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:23.520
How's it going?

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:27.890
Why did you suddenly ask me to review
the archives about Shuikou Village?

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.540
Captain Qin told me

00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:33.669
about a poisoning case there,

00:08:34.110 --> 00:08:35.909
which might be related to Guazi.

00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:37.870
I just sorted out some information.

00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:39.360
The main cause of this poisoning case

00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.549
was a conflict

00:08:40.630 --> 00:08:41.960
between Xiong Chao and a neighbor of his

00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.960
over a government project
of land acquisition.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.360
Xiong Chao got a life sentence
for poisoning this neighbor and his wife,

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.600
who both ended up in a vegetative state.

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:48.670
The key part is,

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.480
Xiong Chao then applied for medical parole

00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:52.550
and was released.

00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:54.960
Medical parole?

00:08:57.870 --> 00:08:58.630
Shortly after that,

00:08:58.630 --> 00:09:01.320
Xiong died accidentally and was removed
from the household register.

00:09:01.320 --> 00:09:02.440
Wasn't it too convenient?

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:04.840
Are you suspecting Xiong Chao was actually

00:09:05.060 --> 00:09:06.030
Guazi?

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:07.440
Look at this.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:09.950
Back then, Xiong Chao's attorney

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.280
was Zhang Xin.

00:09:16.470 --> 00:09:19.160
Zhang Xin was his defending lawyer.

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:26.690
Could it be possible that Xiong Chao...

00:09:27.530 --> 00:09:28.590
actually lived on,

00:09:29.710 --> 00:09:31.750
got hidden by Zhang Xin,

00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.040
and started working for her thereafter?

00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:35.900
That was probably the case.

00:09:36.150 --> 00:09:39.280
Crime becomes easier
when one has a dead man's identity.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:42.810
We're still trying to crack

00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:45.170
those numbers and codes that are probably

00:09:46.110 --> 00:09:47.440
related to Hong Mushou.

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:52.120
Any updates

00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:52.870
on Meng Yu?

00:09:53.510 --> 00:09:57.380
We've traced her phone number,
bank cards, home address,

00:09:57.400 --> 00:10:00.150
and all her information online.

00:10:00.910 --> 00:10:03.530
But she seems to have vanished
into thin air.

00:10:04.150 --> 00:10:06.150
I've heard she's not even in contact

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:08.360
with her schoolmates and teachers.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.050
Wait, she has family, doesn't she?

00:10:13.750 --> 00:10:15.770
A living person can't just...

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:17.360
disappear like that.

00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:19.950
Her parents divorced long ago.

00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.190
Her father

00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.360
works in another city

00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:24.840
and barely contacts her and her mother.

00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:26.750
A neighbor of hers told me

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:27.750
that her mother

00:10:28.270 --> 00:10:30.150
received a sum of money a few days ago

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:31.840
and just left afterwards.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:33.000
But guys,

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:34.000
don't worry.

00:10:34.750 --> 00:10:35.900
Yuan Song and his fellows

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:37.030
are looking into it.

00:10:37.390 --> 00:10:38.080
Okay.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:41.330
That said,
we must do something about Zhang Xin.

00:10:41.370 --> 00:10:43.830
Since Zhang Xin has a connection
with Guazi,

00:10:44.440 --> 00:10:46.900
let's use him to urge Zhang Xin
to make a move.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:48.630
What's your plan?

00:10:49.550 --> 00:10:50.390
I suggest we send

00:10:50.390 --> 00:10:51.700
someone to meet

00:10:52.320 --> 00:10:54.510
Xiong Chao's parents in Shuikou Village.

00:10:54.510 --> 00:10:56.510
We might get through to them, right?

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.080
The bureau must be

00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.010
investigating these matters too.

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:02.200
I know.

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.030
But the bureau's approaches

00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:06.020
might not work well in a place like that.

00:11:06.020 --> 00:11:07.920
So I propose we try a different way.

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:10.020
Shall I call Jiu?

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:21.960
Jiu,

00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:25.390
do you know anyone in Shuikou Village?

Come in!

00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:29.750
Director Peng,

00:11:30.030 --> 00:11:31.080
we've found out Guazi's real identity

00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:32.670
and his connection to Zhang Xin.

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:34.120
I'd like to interrogate him myself.

00:11:34.120 --> 00:11:35.850
There might be a breakthrough.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.670
How did you find that out?

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:39.390

long ago.

Xiong Chao, listen.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:57.320
Our investigation shows

00:14:57.320 --> 00:14:59.510
that your parents received a transfer
every 3 months

00:14:59.510 --> 00:15:02.360
in the past few years
from different bank accounts.

00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:03.980
We now suspect the money

00:15:04.630 --> 00:15:06.120
was sent by you to your parents,

00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:07.040
or perhaps

00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:09.840
by Zhang Xin at your request.

00:15:11.870 --> 00:15:13.750
That gives us reason to believe

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.680
that your parents knowingly
withheld information.

00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.550
my hunch is telling me

00:16:41.550 --> 00:16:43.550
that the Shuikou Village poisoning case

00:16:43.550 --> 00:16:45.790
is absolutely crucial
for breaking Xiong Chao down

00:16:45.790 --> 00:16:47.250
and convicting Zhang Xin.

00:16:47.510 --> 00:16:50.050
Even if Zhang Xin can't be
held accountable for other cases,

00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:51.980
this one will definitely nail her.

00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.240
I've had her under surveillance.

00:16:54.240 --> 00:16:55.720
She's on the border control list too.

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.580
I can have her brought in anytime.

However,

will absolutely convict her?

00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.880
as soon as possible.

00:21:44.240 --> 00:21:45.110
Why?

00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:48.680
Why is it me who's leaving?

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:56.050
After spending so many years in Hanzhou,

00:21:57.060 --> 00:21:58.790
I have nothing to show for it.

00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:02.290
Two decades of hard work

00:22:02.350 --> 00:22:03.680
has gone down the drain.

00:22:04.750 --> 00:22:06.030
It's just like a joke.

00:22:17.550 --> 00:22:19.750
When you dragged me into this years ago,

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:21.530
you should have seen this day coming.

00:22:21.530 --> 00:22:24.130
Don't describe yourself
as some sort of saint.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:33.790
Back then, you were a widely acclaimed

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:34.640
rising star.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.610
But now you're even inferior to me.

00:22:39.460 --> 00:22:41.320
On the day I took you to bed,

00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:44.920
we became birds of a feather.

00:22:47.130 --> 00:22:48.880
You accepted all the girls

00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:52.110
I sent to you, didn't you?

00:22:53.990 --> 00:22:54.850
At those times,

00:22:55.830 --> 00:22:57.360
did you see this day coming?

00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.850
Don't you ever think
you can raise your voice to me

00:23:04.070 --> 00:23:06.030
now that you've got some dirt on me.

00:23:08.720 --> 00:23:10.110
I gave you

00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:12.470
everything you have today.

00:23:14.590 --> 00:23:16.250
You'd better know your place.

00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:22.550
I'm already preserving your dignity
by letting you leave.

00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:24.470
You should be satisfied.

00:23:25.270 --> 00:23:27.470
I don't need you to preserve my dignity.

00:23:28.270 --> 00:23:29.160
It is high time

00:23:30.070 --> 00:23:32.400
you thought about
how to wrap up this mess.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:51.230
Ms. Zhang.

00:23:53.350 --> 00:23:54.620
Did the boss tell you?

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:55.470
Yes.

00:23:55.590 --> 00:23:56.550
He instructed me

00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.280
to keep the item safe for now.

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:04.640
The police might be watching you
in Hanzhou.

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.240
So the boss has planned
a special route for you.

00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:10.070
Ms. Zhang,

00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:11.070
what else can I do for you?

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:11.830
[Passport]

00:24:12.990 --> 00:24:13.600
Nothing.

00:24:15.640 --> 00:24:16.780
That's all. Let's go.

00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:17.430
Okay.

00:24:37.750 --> 00:24:38.400
Ms. Zhang,

00:24:38.750 --> 00:24:40.350
this is as far as I can get you.

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:42.470
I wish you a safe journey.

00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:46.340
Thank you for all you've done
in these years.

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.310
There is 5 million

00:24:51.510 --> 00:24:52.510
in this card.

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:53.440
Take it.

00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.200
Don't go back to the boss.

00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:59.000
Start a new life somewhere else.

00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:01.840
Thank you, Ms. Zhang.

00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:02.020
[Uncle]

00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.480
Is Zhang Xin gone?

00:26:04.810 --> 00:26:04.990
Uncle,

00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:05.920
[He Kang, Son of Hong Mushou's Cousin]

00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:07.180
I've taken care of her.

00:26:07.270 --> 00:26:07.960
Zhang Xin

00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:08.830
must die.

00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:11.300
Or she'll be too big a liability to us.

00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.930
What are you guys doing?

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:34.050
Help!

00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:38.680
Alright.

00:26:38.800 --> 00:26:39.800
Stop beating him.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:40.700
It's enough.

00:26:48.740 --> 00:26:50.540
Mr. Liu! Mr. Liu...

00:26:50.910 --> 00:26:52.970
Mr. Liu, please help me!

00:26:53.710 --> 00:26:54.920
I've been nothing but obedient

00:26:54.920 --> 00:26:56.240
to you over all these years.

00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:58.170
I've never offended you in any way!

00:26:58.310 --> 00:26:58.970
Take a look.

00:26:59.790 --> 00:27:00.390
Do you know

00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:02.030
what these stand for,

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:03.400
Vice President Song?

00:27:08.060 --> 00:27:09.460
How did you get these?

00:27:09.920 --> 00:27:11.350
I'm asking you,

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:14.020
not the other way around.

00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.780
What's this stuff?

00:27:21.160 --> 00:27:22.290
You won't talk, huh?

00:27:22.790 --> 00:27:23.310
Fine.

00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:25.600
Keeping silent, huh?

00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:26.510
Okay.

00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.570
Stay quiet then.

00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:33.760
Very tight-lipped, aren't you?

00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:43.530
Will you talk or not?

00:27:46.590 --> 00:27:47.520
Confess or what?

00:27:48.590 --> 00:27:49.480
If I tell...

00:27:50.240 --> 00:27:52.300
If I tell the truth, I'll die!

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:54.720
All of you will die too!

00:27:58.160 --> 00:27:59.110
Say it,

00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:01.780
or your life ends now.

00:28:06.590 --> 00:28:07.770
I'll tell the truth!

00:28:07.790 --> 00:28:08.720
I will! I will!

00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:10.590
I'll tell you everything!

00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:15.400
Those...

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:19.350
are Mayor Hong's
overseas nominee accounts.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.260
Zhang Xin had me manage them before.

00:28:29.400 --> 00:28:30.730
Give me those accounts.

00:28:31.030 --> 00:28:31.790
All of them.

00:28:32.430 --> 00:28:34.500
I don't have them with me.

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:35.830
Now, they're all

00:28:35.830 --> 00:28:38.230
being managed by Kang, Zhang Xin's driver.

00:28:38.310 --> 00:28:39.800
You should talk to Kang

00:28:39.830 --> 00:28:40.920
instead of me!

00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:53.570
A pair of eights.

00:28:53.790 --> 00:28:54.590
A pair of twos.

00:28:55.270 --> 00:28:55.870
I'll pass.

00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:57.360
A four.

00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:18.270
Sir,

00:29:18.400 --> 00:29:19.730
Zhang Xin went missing.

00:29:21.160 --> 00:29:22.200
How did that happen?

00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.180
We've been watching the several places

00:29:23.180 --> 00:29:24.160
owned by Zhang Xin,

00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.640
but there's been no sign of her.

00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.300
Besides, her driver, He Kang,

00:29:27.310 --> 00:29:28.510
is out of contact now.

00:29:28.550 --> 00:29:29.980
They've likely fled.

00:29:30.110 --> 00:29:30.790
I'm afraid

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:32.320
there might be an incident.

00:29:50.270 --> 00:29:52.190
Once the police break Guazi down,

00:29:52.480 --> 00:29:53.930
Zhang Xin will surely try to flee.

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:55.260
We can't let her escape.

00:29:55.400 --> 00:29:56.480
Escape?

00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:57.440
Not a chance.

00:29:57.440 --> 00:29:59.160
You think she can flee that easily?

00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:00.690
Then you're suggesting...

00:30:01.250 --> 00:30:02.300
Listen,

00:30:03.470 --> 00:30:05.670
a golden opportunity is coming our way—

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.600
presented by her driver.

00:30:43.310 --> 00:30:44.550
If you want to live,

00:30:44.970 --> 00:30:46.370
keep your mouth shut.

00:30:49.990 --> 00:30:52.230
[Staff Only]

00:30:58.260 --> 00:31:00.500
[Staff Only]

00:31:14.950 --> 00:31:16.370
[Done]

00:31:16.490 --> 00:31:17.520
[Send]

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:18.060
[Message sending]

00:31:22.760 --> 00:31:25.260
[Done]

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:33.280
You have no right to confine me.

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:35.360
You are not police.

00:31:36.110 --> 00:31:37.240
We're not confining you.

00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:39.640
The door's there. Leave whenever you want.

00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:41.070
Go ahead.

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:44.240
How ungrateful.

00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:46.300
This is not confinement.
We just want you to stay here for a bit.

00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:47.830
So what if we do confine you?

00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:50.030
Zhang Xin,

00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:52.550
to be honest,

00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.270
if you weren't still useful to us,

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.640
we would have sat back
and watched you die,

00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.590
because you deserve it.

00:32:03.270 --> 00:32:05.310
Look, you're a mother.

00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:07.350
Xu Li

00:32:08.350 --> 00:32:09.160
was about

00:32:10.070 --> 00:32:12.600
your daughter's age,
and so is Meng Yu, right?

00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:14.880
To curry favor with Hong Mushou,

00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:16.340
you committed great evil.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:19.090
Don't you deserve the worst punishment?

00:32:21.750 --> 00:32:22.480
Captain Qin,

00:32:23.680 --> 00:32:25.810
what exactly do you want to talk about?

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:27.110
Nothing much.

00:32:28.030 --> 00:32:29.560
Do you know where Meng Yu is?

00:32:32.430 --> 00:32:34.890
Say something.
Do you have the answer or not?

00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:37.830
You're still keeping it secret.

00:32:37.830 --> 00:32:38.960
I really wonder why.

00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:41.720
If we hadn't saved you earlier,

00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:43.720
you would have died there, you know?

00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:45.960
Would you be sitting here right now?

00:32:47.790 --> 00:32:49.030
Why not just confess?

00:32:49.790 --> 00:32:51.250
You're truly ungrateful.

00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:55.440
Zhang Xin, I suggest you tell the truth.

00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:57.350
After all, this is

00:32:57.350 --> 00:32:59.110
your only chance to survive.

00:33:00.120 --> 00:33:01.450
I'm done talking to you.

00:33:01.510 --> 00:33:02.270
Tell us where she is if you know.

00:33:02.270 --> 00:33:03.270
If you don't know,

00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:05.750
I'll send a photo of you and this location
to those people.

00:33:05.750 --> 00:33:06.510
When they arrive,

00:33:06.510 --> 00:33:07.720
sort out the problem yourselves.

00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:08.350
Alright?

00:33:11.950 --> 00:33:13.470
It's not that easy for you

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:14.750
to bring the boss down.

00:33:14.750 --> 00:33:16.200
That's for us to worry about.

00:33:16.200 --> 00:33:18.460
All you need to do is tell us
what you know.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.130
I really have no idea

00:33:20.310 --> 00:33:21.240
where Meng Yu is.

00:33:32.550 --> 00:33:34.960
I bet you have the answer
to the next question.

00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:35.690
What's this?

00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:38.830
You got it from Liu Tianye?

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:41.890
Just answer my question.
Who are you to ask me anything?

00:33:46.410 --> 00:33:48.020
These numbers and codes

00:33:48.590 --> 00:33:51.250
are properties and accounts
held by those women

00:33:51.320 --> 00:33:52.250
for Hong Mushou.

00:33:53.290 --> 00:33:55.620
Previously, Meng Yu was at the Rome Hotel,

00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:57.490
where he kept many of his women.

00:33:57.960 --> 00:33:59.200
But after I left,

00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:00.860
they must've been relocated.

00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.170
Right now,

00:34:02.590 --> 00:34:04.920
Meng Yu is probably being watched by Kang.

00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:07.830
Do you know how to find her?

00:34:08.230 --> 00:34:09.360
She goes to Bo'ai Hospital

00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:11.219
for check-ups on a regular basis.

00:34:12.190 --> 00:34:13.590
You can follow that lead.

00:34:29.409 --> 00:34:29.929
Come in!

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:34.150
Director Chu, Director Ye,

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:35.270
Qin Feng and Mai have come here

00:34:35.270 --> 00:34:36.250
with someone.

00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:37.260
It's Zhang Xin.

00:34:39.960 --> 00:34:40.690
Let them in.

00:34:43.110 --> 00:34:44.040
Don't look at me.

00:34:44.219 --> 00:34:45.949
I didn't tell them to catch her.

00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:46.659
Come on in.

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:48.710
Sirs.

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:51.360
We've brought her here.

00:35:00.320 --> 00:35:01.110
Zhang Xin,

00:35:01.590 --> 00:35:02.800
long time no see.

00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.300
We thought you had got in trouble.

00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:09.870
Luckily, no, thanks to your mentees.

00:35:15.840 --> 00:35:16.440
Yuan Song,

00:35:16.550 --> 00:35:17.610
lead everyone out.

00:35:20.680 --> 00:35:21.920
-Come on. Move.
-Let's go.

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:22.840
-Move.
-Go.

00:35:29.190 --> 00:35:30.250
The floor's yours.

00:35:30.550 --> 00:35:31.230
Come on.

00:35:31.360 --> 00:35:32.760
Explain the whole thing.

00:35:33.960 --> 00:35:34.630
Mentor,

00:35:34.710 --> 00:35:35.510
Director Chu,

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:37.110
we intercepted Zhang Xin

00:35:37.590 --> 00:35:38.850
when she tried to flee.

00:35:39.630 --> 00:35:41.320
We also got some information from her.

00:35:41.320 --> 00:35:42.670
There's a major breakthrough,

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:43.600
I'm telling you.

00:35:45.150 --> 00:35:45.760
What now?

00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.360
Are you expecting praise?

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:52.600
I already told you to report

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:55.170
any developments in a timely manner.

00:35:55.840 --> 00:35:57.000
We're here to make a report now.

00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:57.510
Exactly.

00:35:57.510 --> 00:35:58.030
Right?

00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.060
We've brought Zhang Xin here as well.

00:36:01.110 --> 00:36:02.550
Behind those numbers

00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:04.570
hide Hong Mushou's assets.

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:08.030
We've also got a clue about Meng Yu.

00:36:08.030 --> 00:36:10.030
Bo'ai Hospital might lead us to her.

00:36:10.190 --> 00:36:10.760
Qin Feng!

00:36:12.010 --> 00:36:13.570
I know why you resigned.

00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:14.840
I also know...

00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.000
what intention you harbors.

00:36:17.110 --> 00:36:19.590
The Municipal Bureau plans
to transfer Qin Feng to a secondary role,

00:36:19.590 --> 00:36:21.720
but he has submitted his resignation.

00:36:23.550 --> 00:36:24.760
Qin Feng resigned?

00:36:25.190 --> 00:36:25.710
Yes.

00:36:30.270 --> 00:36:31.070
Get in the car.

00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:39.420
You and your fellows

00:36:39.930 --> 00:36:41.990
are each more stubborn than the last.

00:36:43.530 --> 00:36:45.990
I'm perfectly fine
with quitting the force.

00:36:46.790 --> 00:36:48.650
I know what you're planning to do.

00:36:50.900 --> 00:36:52.350
The organization

00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.530
has deliberated on your resignation.

00:36:57.580 --> 00:36:58.950
The higher-ups would like you

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:00.760
to process it as normal

00:37:00.780 --> 00:37:02.200
and follow the standard procedure

00:37:02.200 --> 00:37:04.250
to make this act look convincing.

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:07.880
Since you'd like to serve your part
as a concerned citizen,

00:37:08.480 --> 00:37:10.940
let's collaborate
as police and a civilian.

00:37:14.990 --> 00:37:17.140
The information you provided earlier
was valuable.

00:37:17.140 --> 00:37:18.990
But now I must warn you both
that you're in

00:37:18.990 --> 00:37:20.400
a very dangerous position.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:21.590
You're only one step away

00:37:21.590 --> 00:37:22.590
from a dark abyss.

00:37:22.800 --> 00:37:24.320
You're not only in danger,

00:37:25.670 --> 00:37:27.870
but also in for more than you can handle.

00:37:28.320 --> 00:37:29.000
Yes, right.

00:37:33.320 --> 00:37:33.920
Yuan Song,

00:37:34.330 --> 00:37:35.870
take them to verify the information.

00:37:35.870 --> 00:37:37.800
Find that girl as soon as possible.

00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:38.320
Yes.

00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:44.180
Let's go verify the information!

00:37:44.550 --> 00:37:45.650
Mentor, Director Chu,

00:37:45.650 --> 00:37:47.050
please don't be mad. I...

00:37:51.670 --> 00:37:53.600
Look at these two mentees of yours.

00:37:53.960 --> 00:37:55.360
They're really like you.

00:37:55.710 --> 00:37:57.770
These lads have gone a bit out of line.

00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:00.970
They have a clear target—

00:38:00.990 --> 00:38:02.330
Hong Mushou.

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:04.000
Plus,

00:38:04.630 --> 00:38:06.340
Qin Feng is highly capable.

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:08.480
He's trying to help us

00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:10.740
through his connection with Liu Tianye.

00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:12.320
But I think we must keep stern

00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.720
in this matter

00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.890
and never let them go rogue

00:38:17.110 --> 00:38:19.670
or even become loose cannons.

00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:21.190
Don't worry.

00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:23.190
I'll talk to them.

00:38:25.110 --> 00:38:26.000
But Chu,

00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:27.230
as I was saying,

00:38:28.150 --> 00:38:30.700
I know these two mentees of mine too well.

00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:34.070
They're as stubborn as a mule

00:38:34.630 --> 00:38:36.320
and hell-bent on their own courses.

00:38:36.320 --> 00:38:38.450
Yes. Like mentor, like mentee, right?

00:38:39.500 --> 00:38:40.880
Tell me what you've planned for them.

00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:41.800
In my opinion,

00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:43.570
there's no use

00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:44.710
stopping them.

00:38:45.030 --> 00:38:47.280
It's better
to make use of their strengths.

00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:47.960
After all,

00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:50.360
they've obtained many valuable leads.

00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:52.280
Okay.

00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.920
I'll leave them to your discretion then.

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:57.520
I allow them to assist
with the investigation,

00:38:57.590 --> 00:38:59.670
but they must be kept under control.

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:02.000
In particular,
Qin Feng has to recuse himself

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.800
from matters concerning Liu Tianye.
That's a rule

00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:05.760
Rest assured.

00:39:06.110 --> 00:39:07.510
He's well aware of that.

00:39:08.710 --> 00:39:10.920
It's been over 10 years

00:39:10.920 --> 00:39:12.080
since Xu Li's case.

00:39:12.590 --> 00:39:15.670
The two of them
have been persistently working on it.

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:18.120
There's one thing I can guarantee:

00:39:18.550 --> 00:39:20.280
they are both trustworthy.

00:39:29.550 --> 00:39:31.690
I remember this girl.

00:39:31.760 --> 00:39:33.360
I gave her check-ups before.

00:39:34.030 --> 00:39:35.280
But I don't think...

00:39:35.630 --> 00:39:36.850

Who was she with when she received

00:39:50.280 --> 00:39:51.210
check-ups here?

00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:55.060
As I recall, she was accompanied
by two male relatives.

00:39:55.190 --> 00:39:56.550
She's been here twice.

00:39:56.710 --> 00:39:58.310
We've made a house call once.

The doctors here make house calls?

00:40:00.590 --> 00:40:01.230
Yes.

00:40:01.880 --> 00:40:03.280
Our medical vans would usually park

00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:04.760
in the underground garages
of residential buildings
