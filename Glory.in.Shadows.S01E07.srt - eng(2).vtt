00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:20.350
Madam only caught a cold.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:21.590
Nothing serious.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.280
She should be waking up by now.

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:26.510
Thanks, Mr. Zhang.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.150
No problem, General.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.480
I'll go write a prescription
for Madam now.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.000
Nuan'er, see the physician out.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:36.960
Yes.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.120
You've woken up.

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:53.120
Tell me, why am I still alive?

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:54.920
What nonsense are you spouting?

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.400
I planned and schemed so much,

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:04.950
all just to keep my mother alive.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:09.400
If I had known it would end like this,

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.840
I would've gone to the grave

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.750
with your robes.

00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:18.190
Perhaps then,

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.630
my mother might still be alive.

00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:24.840
Are you saying your life doesn't matter?

00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.960
My mother is gone.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:35.520
What's the point of me living on?

00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:40.870
All I ever wanted

00:02:41.710 --> 00:02:42.960
was to find my younger sister,

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:46.240
and live a simple life with my mother.

00:02:48.430 --> 00:02:50.560
Why is that too much to ask?

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.400
Why must I fight against Concubine Xie?

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:02.080
Why can't I just obey quietly?

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:07.870
Why couldn't the one
to die have been me?

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.520
Yaochu,

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.080
you must go on living.

00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:21.310
Not as someone's daughter
or someone's wife,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.470
but as a blade,

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.710
a blade that strikes
against all the injustice.

00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:37.000
You must live on.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.960
You still have to avenge your mother.

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.030
I've already sent people
to examine the body.

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:50.520
The culprit may not be Shen Yunxi.

00:03:59.080 --> 00:03:59.960
How did

00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:01.840
my mother die?

00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:04.450
The coroner has confirmed the cause.

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:06.840
Your mother was poisoned first,

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:09.080
then someone cut her throat.

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:13.520
What kind of poison?

00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:15.080
Scorpion Venom.

00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:16.660
This poison comes
from the Western Regions.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.000
I've had someone search
Shen Yunxi's residence.

00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:20.320
But nothing was found.

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:21.550
The one who killed your mother

00:04:22.430 --> 00:04:23.600
may be someone else.

00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:30.120
What are you doing?

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:31.590
General,

00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:34.560
I'm all alone, with no support.

00:04:35.240 --> 00:04:36.360
I have no one to turn to.

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:38.480
All I have is my own life.

00:04:39.190 --> 00:04:40.070
If you

00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.870
can help me find out how my mom died,

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:45.680
my life is yours.

00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.520
I give you my word.

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.320
Mother!

00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:35.150
Mother.

00:05:35.500 --> 00:05:36.350
- Mother!
- Jingchuan.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:37.660
(Jingchuan's birth mother Lady Yan)
Mother.

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.020
- Jingchuan, why are you here?
- Mother.

00:05:39.020 --> 00:05:39.860
(Young Jingchuan)
Mother.

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:43.000
You must leave now.

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.750
- Mother.
- Leave now.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:46.120
Your father doesn't want you
visiting me.

00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:47.760
- Go now.
- Mother!

00:05:48.050 --> 00:05:48.920
Mother.

00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:50.870
They all say you're dying.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.070
You can't leave me.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.120
Please don't leave me all alone.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:55.790
Mother.

00:05:57.800 --> 00:05:58.640
Jingchuan.

00:05:58.830 --> 00:05:59.950
Be good.

00:06:01.830 --> 00:06:03.830
I can't give you anything right now.

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:05.560
Here in the Marquis' Manor,

00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:08.830
you must live on, and live well.

00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:10.950
You must make something of yourself.

00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.270
Otherwise, I couldn't rest in peace.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.520
Mother.

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:19.080
Mother!

00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:20.830
Mother.

00:06:21.630 --> 00:06:22.470
Mother.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.270
General.

00:06:32.430 --> 00:06:33.720
I have one more favor to ask of you.

00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.040
My mother's greatest regret

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.480
was that she never found
my younger sister, Shen Yunge.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.360
So,

00:06:48.190 --> 00:06:49.040
please help me find her.

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.920
You have a younger sister?

00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:52.400
Yes.

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:57.160
But she was sold by Xie Siyun

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.390
to a human trafficker
when she was still an infant.

00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:04.480
We haven't heard from her since.

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:06.870
On her left shoulder,

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:08.950
there's a birthmark.

00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:12.120
It's shaped like a flower petal.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.560
My mother
carved this jade pendant for her,

00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.160
matching the shape of her birthmark.

00:07:24.240 --> 00:07:25.270
But we don't know

00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:29.160
whether she's still alive.

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:31.030
Alright.

00:07:31.830 --> 00:07:32.670
I'll help you find her.

00:07:37.430 --> 00:07:38.360
Thank you, General.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.720
Is this news certain?

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.430
I just sent someone to confirm it.

00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:49.720
Madam Shen's mother was killed,

00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:51.240
and the third young lady was injured.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.870
The Shen family

00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:56.000
is really making a huge fool
of themselves.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.070
People from such a family

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.560
truly can't hold their heads high.

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.240
Old Madam, you are right.

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:08.920
But looking at things now,

00:08:09.390 --> 00:08:11.630
it seems Jingchuan
does take her side quite often.

00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:18.190
I failed to win the General's favor.

00:08:18.480 --> 00:08:19.480
I'll try my best.

00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:20.560
Forget it.

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.680
When a man gets carried away by desire,

00:08:23.680 --> 00:08:25.310
he can't see straight anyway.

00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:27.390
But in the inner chambers,

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:30.430
it is still us women who hold sway.

00:08:31.310 --> 00:08:32.150
Yes.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:38.320
Jingchuan will soon be leaving
on official business.

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:40.510
The General is leaving again?

00:08:41.910 --> 00:08:43.550
Recently, I'm worn out

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.550
and can't deal with trivialities.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:48.630
I'll entrust the house affairs to you,

00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:51.270
so you can get some experience.

00:08:53.630 --> 00:08:54.470
Really?

00:08:58.080 --> 00:08:59.360
Old Madam, thank you.

00:08:59.510 --> 00:09:00.360
I

00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:02.360
will never fail your trust.

00:09:04.510 --> 00:09:06.390
Then I'll go prepare.

00:09:09.270 --> 00:09:10.110
Yes.

00:09:16.960 --> 00:09:18.120
Idiot.

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.110
Madam.

00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.030
The old Madam wouldn't even see you.

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.150
Yet she shows such favor
toward Concubine Qin.

00:09:25.750 --> 00:09:27.000
How does that make any sense?

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.840
Now,

00:09:30.240 --> 00:09:31.960
I've failed to
win the General's affection,

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:34.840
and lost the old Madam's favor.

00:09:35.870 --> 00:09:37.270
How am I to endure life

00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:40.080
in this vast Marquis' Manor?

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.140
(Prefecture Governor's Manor)

00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:54.320
What is that you're wearing?

00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.540
Who died?

00:09:56.540 --> 00:09:57.510
What are you doing?

00:09:57.750 --> 00:09:58.670
Tell me,

00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:59.840
is Shen Yaochu dead?

00:10:00.480 --> 00:10:01.720
Or is it her mother?

00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.560
Who died?

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:04.080
Let go of me!

00:10:05.600 --> 00:10:06.480
Who died?

00:10:13.440 --> 00:10:15.670
You'll never defeat me in the end.

00:10:28.480 --> 00:10:29.440
You're still alive.

00:10:31.390 --> 00:10:32.320
Then the one who died was

00:10:33.750 --> 00:10:34.630
your mother?

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:38.630
Shen Yaochu.

00:10:39.480 --> 00:10:41.360
You turned me into this wreck.

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:43.120
And still couldn't save your mother.

00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:44.630
You've lost.

00:10:45.510 --> 00:10:47.320
Even with the General guarding you,

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.840
you still can't defeat me!

00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:54.240
You gave Shen Yunxi the Scorpion Venom?

00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:56.030
What Scorpion Venom?

00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:58.200
Yunxi.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:00.720
Where is Yunxi?

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:05.390
Your mother died from poison.

00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:07.440
So you came to me for the antidote?

00:11:08.600 --> 00:11:10.200
Tell me where Yunxi is.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:11.870
Then I'll give you the antidote.

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:13.960
It wasn't you.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:15.550
What do you mean?

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:17.040
It was me.

00:11:17.270 --> 00:11:18.510
I killed her!

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:20.550
Yunxi has nothing to do with it.

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:22.120
I killed her!

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.510
Where did you send my sister back then?

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:27.990
Your sister?

00:11:30.750 --> 00:11:32.000
You're looking for your sister?

00:11:34.870 --> 00:11:35.710
Back then...

00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.000
I sold her into a pleasure house.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:40.840
Take a guess.

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.630
Guess what she's become now.

00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:48.840
Shen Yaochu.

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:51.670
Now respectfully take me back

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:54.320
and address me as "Mother",

00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:56.360
and I'll tell you

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:58.320
where that girl is.

00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.800
How about that?

00:12:05.630 --> 00:12:07.440
Don't go!

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:09.910
Tell me!

00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:11.440
Where is Yunxi?

00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:13.750
Oh right,

00:12:15.150 --> 00:12:17.200
Shen Yunxi assassinated
the wife of the Prefect

00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:20.120
and kidnapped the third young lady
of the Marquis' Manor.

00:12:22.510 --> 00:12:23.440
She was shot dead

00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:25.870
on the spot.

00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:31.390
No.

00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:32.480
No!

00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:33.320
That's impossible.
