WEBVTT

00:00:04.305 --> 00:00:06.865
This is no longer a simple murder.

00:00:06.945 --> 00:00:08.505
I think we're dealing
with a serial killer.

00:00:08.585 --> 00:00:11.265
The killer's targeting this entire group.

00:00:12.225 --> 00:00:14.105
Do you think the two of us
can really stop this?

00:00:14.185 --> 00:00:16.105
If we work together,

00:00:16.184 --> 00:00:17.705
we'll catch the killer.

00:00:18.225 --> 00:00:19.905
You brought me to your house?

00:00:19.985 --> 00:00:23.105
I'm sorry that
I'm not dressed very formally.

00:00:23.705 --> 00:00:25.145
You should get used to this.

00:00:25.785 --> 00:00:27.465
You're going to see it a lot.

00:00:30.105 --> 00:00:32.305
HEADLIGHT RESTORATION SERVICE

00:00:37.745 --> 00:00:39.185
MAINTENANCE, ENGINE

00:00:42.385 --> 00:00:43.625
Are you done with work?

00:00:49.065 --> 00:00:51.385
Bro, can I get some money first?

00:00:51.465 --> 00:00:53.345
What? It's not the end of the month yet.

00:00:53.425 --> 00:00:57.465
It's for a university activity.
My friends need me to pay first.

00:00:58.065 --> 00:00:59.745
You're just going to blow it on booze.

00:01:00.345 --> 00:01:02.025
What kind of person do you think I am?

00:01:02.105 --> 00:01:03.465
Let me warn you, Kla.

00:01:03.545 --> 00:01:05.985
If you don't have money,
live within your means.

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:07.585
Close the garage.

00:01:11.985 --> 00:01:13.225
Fuck you. (Support Admin Watch on

00:01:29.785 --> 00:01:30.625
Hey!

00:03:07.545 --> 00:03:10.065
Check the fingerprints
and the source of the images too.

00:03:10.145 --> 00:03:11.505
Sure.

00:03:11.585 --> 00:03:13.745
Oh, we've got this too.

CASE FILE: FOURTH-YEAR STUDENT MURDER

00:03:17.145 --> 00:03:18.025
PHYSICAL INJURIES

00:03:18.105 --> 00:03:22.625
We found ecstasy, marijuana,
and date-rape drugs in the victim's bag.

00:03:22.705 --> 00:03:25.105
And there were hidden items
on the motorcycle as well.

00:03:25.185 --> 00:03:28.505
What concerns me is that
we also found ketamine and phencyclidine

00:03:28.585 --> 00:03:32.185
in the storage room
where Tar's body was found.

00:03:39.985 --> 00:03:42.745
-Ketamine and phencyclidine?
-Yes.

00:03:42.825 --> 00:03:44.745
But what puzzles me is that

00:03:44.825 --> 00:03:47.585
we didn't find any ketamine
among the victim's personal belongings.

00:03:54.065 --> 00:03:57.425
I'll follow up with the forensic team
and see if they found anything.

00:03:57.505 --> 00:03:59.785
-All right.
-What about fingerprints on the weapon?

00:03:59.865 --> 00:04:03.345
No fingerprints were found
on the metal rod used as the weapon.

00:04:04.265 --> 00:04:07.505
It appears the motive was
personal revenge.

00:04:13.225 --> 00:04:15.105
IN A RELATIONSHIP

00:04:18.184 --> 00:04:20.504
The killer is likely someone
in the Avengers.

00:04:23.025 --> 00:04:24.385
As for Tar's murder,

00:04:27.385 --> 00:04:28.825
it seems to be the same person.

00:04:28.905 --> 00:04:31.825
The method and pattern…

00:04:31.905 --> 00:04:33.745
They drugged the victim

00:04:34.305 --> 00:04:36.585
to make them intoxicated
before killing them.

00:04:36.665 --> 00:04:40.825
And here's the key piece of evidence
that points us to the Avengers.

00:04:44.745 --> 00:04:46.305
The truth or dare game.

00:04:46.385 --> 00:04:48.265
It's a game they like to play.

00:04:49.545 --> 00:04:53.545
The fact that the killer used
this game as a gimmick

00:04:53.625 --> 00:04:57.865
suggests they know them quite well.

00:04:58.545 --> 00:05:02.105
And I'm certain this won't end
with just Puifai and Tar.

00:05:04.145 --> 00:05:06.225
If we don't catch the killer soon,

00:05:06.305 --> 00:05:08.105
more kids will die, one by one.

00:05:09.305 --> 00:05:10.265
Lieutenant Pai,

00:05:10.865 --> 00:05:14.785
please order our informants
to keep an eye on all of them.

00:05:14.865 --> 00:05:16.705
Including your younger brother, Captain?

00:05:22.065 --> 00:05:24.745
Yes. Include him.

00:05:27.465 --> 00:05:30.505
It's fine. We'll watch Jay ourselves.

00:05:30.585 --> 00:05:33.865
Inspector, people will say
he's getting special treatment.

00:05:33.945 --> 00:05:35.785
I want Jay to trust us.

00:05:36.985 --> 00:05:40.025
As you can see,
these kids are hiding a lot.

00:05:42.185 --> 00:05:44.105
If Jay trusts us,

00:05:45.185 --> 00:05:49.385
we might get more information.

00:05:53.465 --> 00:05:55.505
Everyone, get back to work.

00:05:55.585 --> 00:05:56.465
All right.

00:05:58.225 --> 00:05:59.105
As for you,

00:06:00.585 --> 00:06:01.905
come to forensics with me.

00:06:05.505 --> 00:06:08.745
Inspector, may I have a word?

00:06:09.625 --> 00:06:12.945
RESIDENTIAL LEASE AGREEMENT

00:06:16.625 --> 00:06:18.665
You worked on this all night?

00:06:19.465 --> 00:06:21.345
If it gets you to stay at my place,

00:06:21.985 --> 00:06:23.185
it wasn't that hard.

00:06:23.905 --> 00:06:26.425
You're that desperate for me
to stay at your place.

00:06:26.505 --> 00:06:27.505
Are you lacking some warmth?

00:06:28.585 --> 00:06:30.265
If my answer is yes,

00:06:30.945 --> 00:06:32.825
are you going to give me that warmth?

00:06:35.545 --> 00:06:37.425
You're fast when it comes to this.

00:06:38.505 --> 00:06:40.905
I hope you can be this fast at work too.

00:06:40.985 --> 00:06:42.745
It depends on who's asking.

00:06:42.825 --> 00:06:46.305
If it's you,
maybe it'll take just one night.

00:06:47.425 --> 00:06:48.625
Read carefully

00:06:50.745 --> 00:06:51.905
and sign.

00:06:57.985 --> 00:07:02.625
You barely stay at that
180,000-a-night hotel anyway.

00:07:02.705 --> 00:07:04.385
Stay at my place instead.

00:07:05.145 --> 00:07:06.665
When there's a case,

00:07:07.345 --> 00:07:08.585
we can head out together.

00:07:08.665 --> 00:07:09.945
Number 18.

00:07:10.945 --> 00:07:13.105
No discussing work at home.

00:07:13.185 --> 00:07:14.625
What does that mean?

00:07:14.705 --> 00:07:17.505
Home is for resting, right?

00:07:18.265 --> 00:07:19.345
So no work talk.

00:07:21.185 --> 00:07:22.665
Then I won't sign.

00:07:23.825 --> 00:07:25.465
I have to work.

00:07:25.545 --> 00:07:26.745
Wait, Inspector.

00:07:27.745 --> 00:07:30.705
I'm not saying you can't work.

00:07:31.305 --> 00:07:34.785
Just don't talk about work at home.

00:07:37.425 --> 00:07:41.185
If you've read everything, sign it now.

00:07:46.185 --> 00:07:47.185
Inspector?

00:07:47.265 --> 00:07:49.945
I'll read it carefully first.

00:07:50.625 --> 00:07:52.385
Come on, Inspector.

00:07:52.465 --> 00:07:54.265
One quick signature and it's done.

00:07:54.345 --> 00:07:56.105
This is work hours.

00:07:56.185 --> 00:07:58.945
I'll sign after I'm done with work.

00:08:01.105 --> 00:08:02.305
Let's go.

00:08:13.265 --> 00:08:15.865
You're late again, Captain.

00:08:17.065 --> 00:08:19.065
Late? I'm right on time.

00:08:19.945 --> 00:08:21.625
We're really late.

00:08:22.745 --> 00:08:24.025
Thirty seconds late.

00:08:24.905 --> 00:08:26.505
I'm sorry about that, doctor.

00:08:28.025 --> 00:08:29.025
Well, I'm Tankhun.

00:08:29.105 --> 00:08:30.105
And you?

00:08:32.225 --> 00:08:33.825
I'm Inspector Kamin.

00:08:37.825 --> 00:08:39.305
I'm sorry we're late.

00:08:40.784 --> 00:08:42.144
No problem at all, Inspector.

00:08:42.225 --> 00:08:45.305
You're actually very punctual,

00:08:45.385 --> 00:08:48.625
compared to Captain, who is always late.

00:08:48.705 --> 00:08:51.105
Wow, Doctor.

00:08:51.185 --> 00:08:54.065
You always give me an earful
for showing up late,

00:08:54.145 --> 00:08:57.385
but you're going easy
on the new inspector.

00:09:04.265 --> 00:09:05.665
Shall we begin?

00:09:07.425 --> 00:09:09.505
This way, please.

00:09:10.705 --> 00:09:12.065
Right this way, please.

00:09:14.105 --> 00:09:19.825
External examination shows
four metal rods embedded in the body,

00:09:19.905 --> 00:09:22.785
and a nail driven into
the center of the chest.

00:09:22.865 --> 00:09:26.545
However, the actual cause of death
was massive blood loss.

00:09:27.145 --> 00:09:28.825
Anything found internally?

00:09:28.905 --> 00:09:32.145
The stomach contained
a large amount of liquid,

00:09:32.225 --> 00:09:34.985
mostly food and alcohol.

00:09:35.065 --> 00:09:36.705
More importantly…

00:09:39.545 --> 00:09:40.465
Here you go.

00:09:46.145 --> 00:09:47.265
Ketamine?

00:09:47.865 --> 00:09:49.905
Yes. Besides marijuana,

00:09:49.985 --> 00:09:53.985
ketamine was found around the victim's
face and upper respiratory tract.

00:09:54.065 --> 00:09:59.705
I believe the killer used ketamine
to induce hallucinations.

00:09:59.785 --> 00:10:03.265
Why make the victim hallucinate
when they could've killed him right away?

00:10:03.345 --> 00:10:08.145
They probably wanted to make him
lose control of his body,

00:10:08.225 --> 00:10:09.665
to carry out the crime easily.

00:10:09.745 --> 00:10:12.905
I'll send the rest of the details
in a report.

00:10:15.105 --> 00:10:16.105
Here.

00:10:16.185 --> 00:10:17.425
May I have your LINE contact?

00:10:20.025 --> 00:10:22.545
Oh, I don't really use LINE.

00:10:23.305 --> 00:10:25.905
I'll give you my email instead.

00:10:28.265 --> 00:10:29.385
Here.

00:10:30.905 --> 00:10:32.305
Thank you very much.

00:10:40.585 --> 00:10:42.065
In all these years,

00:10:43.105 --> 00:10:44.865
you've never asked for my LINE contact.

00:10:45.585 --> 00:10:47.345
That's because
I don't want to talk to you.

00:10:48.185 --> 00:10:50.225
I want to talk to Inspector Kamin.

00:10:52.345 --> 00:10:53.705
By the way, Captain,

00:10:55.585 --> 00:10:57.785
is the inspector seeing someone?

00:10:59.185 --> 00:11:00.705
If you want to know, ask him yourself.

00:11:07.345 --> 00:11:09.025
Can I get your email too?

00:11:11.905 --> 00:11:13.265
Why do you want it?

00:11:13.945 --> 00:11:16.745
Why not? We work together.

00:11:16.825 --> 00:11:19.105
Don't you think I need to contact you?

00:11:21.105 --> 00:11:22.105
Why?

00:11:22.745 --> 00:11:25.025
Or do you only give it to Dr. Tankhun?

00:11:32.785 --> 00:11:33.785
Here.

00:11:38.945 --> 00:11:41.625
-You use LINE too?
-For convenience.

00:11:42.265 --> 00:11:44.865
Add me so we can stay in touch.

00:11:46.105 --> 00:11:47.945
I thought you said you didn't use it.

00:11:48.025 --> 00:11:49.465
You use this app, don't you?

00:11:51.545 --> 00:11:53.105
So I figured I'd learn.

00:11:57.185 --> 00:11:59.305
COMMANDER DON

00:12:05.865 --> 00:12:08.265
Police have yet to identify the suspect

00:12:08.345 --> 00:12:10.905
in the murder of Tar, or Mr. Dhewin,

00:12:10.985 --> 00:12:14.505
who was impaled with metal rods
at a popular club in Thonglor.

00:12:17.705 --> 00:12:20.585
When I told you to hurry
and catch the killer,

00:12:20.665 --> 00:12:21.945
did you think I was joking?

00:12:22.025 --> 00:12:23.865
We're doing everything we can.

00:12:23.945 --> 00:12:25.185
Don't you see?

00:12:25.265 --> 00:12:26.865
Two students are dead,

00:12:27.745 --> 00:12:29.665
and this mess has reached MP Ratana.

00:12:30.425 --> 00:12:32.025
Where are the suspects?

00:12:32.625 --> 00:12:33.825
Do you even have one?

00:12:33.905 --> 00:12:36.185
We shouldn't rush to conclusions.

00:12:36.265 --> 00:12:38.145
With a second victim,

00:12:38.945 --> 00:12:42.545
we can now confirm
this is a serial murder case.

00:12:42.625 --> 00:12:45.705
-We need to be more cautious.
-Cautious or slow?

00:12:45.785 --> 00:12:48.905
I'm starting to doubt
whether you can handle this.

00:12:49.585 --> 00:12:51.945
Or are you hiding
behind the fact that you are new,

00:12:52.025 --> 00:12:54.305
so I can hand this case to someone else?

00:12:55.345 --> 00:12:56.385
That won't be necessary.

00:12:56.985 --> 00:12:59.785
I swear on my honor

00:13:00.465 --> 00:13:02.665
that I'll see this case through.

00:13:02.745 --> 00:13:05.105
Then hurry up and find the killer.

00:13:05.825 --> 00:13:07.665
But let me make one thing clear.

00:13:07.745 --> 00:13:10.465
Stop getting involved
with MP Ratana's son.

00:13:11.105 --> 00:13:14.505
I know you questioned him
at the university.

00:13:14.585 --> 00:13:20.545
But if the MP's son is innocent,
there's nothing to worry about.

00:13:20.625 --> 00:13:22.225
Inspector Kananon!

00:13:23.505 --> 00:13:25.105
When I warn you, you listen.

00:13:25.705 --> 00:13:29.025
MP Ratana is not someone
you want to get involved with

00:13:29.105 --> 00:13:30.185
and end up in trouble with.

00:13:30.265 --> 00:13:33.025
And I'm not going down with you guys.

00:13:33.985 --> 00:13:35.305
You have seven days.

00:13:35.385 --> 00:13:37.385
If there's no progress on this case,

00:13:38.265 --> 00:13:41.545
I'll assign someone else
to take it over from you.

00:13:52.265 --> 00:13:55.585
DEAD

00:13:55.665 --> 00:13:57.465
This is between the Commander and me.

00:13:58.785 --> 00:14:00.865
You don't have to worry.
It won't backfire on you.

00:14:03.665 --> 00:14:05.625
I'm not worried about that, Inspector.

00:14:06.505 --> 00:14:08.185
Honestly, I admire you.

00:14:10.425 --> 00:14:14.305
I never thought you'd dare stand up
to someone this much.

00:14:18.705 --> 00:14:19.905
DECEASED

00:14:23.825 --> 00:14:26.825
DECEASED

00:14:26.905 --> 00:14:29.425
CRIME SCENE

00:14:32.985 --> 00:14:37.225
HE WAS AT TAR'S CRIME SCENE!

00:14:37.305 --> 00:14:38.585
You can read Thai, right?

00:14:39.505 --> 00:14:43.665
I think Tonkla is definitely hiding
something from us.

00:14:44.665 --> 00:14:46.065
So are Cherreen and Champ.

00:14:46.145 --> 00:14:48.905
But what I'm more suspicious
about right now is…

00:14:55.025 --> 00:14:57.785
THE KILLER'S MOTIVE

00:14:57.865 --> 00:14:59.265
The motive?

00:14:59.345 --> 00:15:00.345
Yes.

00:15:01.785 --> 00:15:03.585
It started with Puifai's death.

00:15:06.625 --> 00:15:09.105
Then Tar, who raped Puifai,

00:15:11.985 --> 00:15:13.625
was killed right after.

00:15:13.705 --> 00:15:17.345
I feel like everything
traces back to Puifai.

00:15:21.345 --> 00:15:24.505
I told you I don't know
anything about Tar.

00:15:25.985 --> 00:15:27.745
Why are you pushing this so hard?

00:15:29.425 --> 00:15:30.985
Then can we talk about Puifai?

00:15:32.225 --> 00:15:33.545
It won't take long.

00:15:35.145 --> 00:15:37.705
About Puifai? Why?

00:15:37.785 --> 00:15:41.065
You usually stayed
with Puifai here, right?

00:15:42.065 --> 00:15:43.025
Sometimes.

00:15:43.665 --> 00:15:46.265
We stayed between my place and hers.

00:15:47.145 --> 00:15:50.465
But I've already returned
all of her belongings to her parents.

00:16:03.145 --> 00:16:05.425
Did Tar and Puifai
have problems with each other?

00:16:06.185 --> 00:16:08.585
-Why are you asking?
-When we ask, you answer.

00:16:08.665 --> 00:16:10.425
Tar did something to Puifai.

00:16:10.505 --> 00:16:13.305
Now they're both suspected murder victims.

00:16:14.065 --> 00:16:15.785
Do you really think it's unrelated?

00:16:15.865 --> 00:16:19.345
Whether it's related or not, I don't know.

00:16:20.185 --> 00:16:22.585
What I do know is I didn't do anything.

00:16:22.665 --> 00:16:25.985
Champ, could you cooperate with us?

00:16:26.065 --> 00:16:28.025
The one who died was your girlfriend.

00:16:30.025 --> 00:16:33.065
-Is there anything you're hiding from us?
-That's enough.

00:16:33.665 --> 00:16:36.945
If you have more questions,
talk to my lawyer.

00:16:37.025 --> 00:16:41.465
Usually, people who avoid cooperating

00:16:43.985 --> 00:16:45.465
are the ones who are guilty.

00:16:45.545 --> 00:16:47.985
It's fine if you don't cooperate now,

00:16:48.065 --> 00:16:50.345
but once we uncover the truth,

00:16:51.585 --> 00:16:52.985
your dad's name won't save you.

00:16:54.385 --> 00:16:56.505
Hey! What are you implying?

00:16:57.585 --> 00:16:59.785
Inspector, please calm down.

00:17:05.505 --> 00:17:06.825
Get out!

00:17:06.905 --> 00:17:08.505
I'll tell my dad about all this.

00:17:08.585 --> 00:17:10.025
You'll be hearing from my lawyer.

00:17:13.265 --> 00:17:14.424
Inspector!

00:17:21.505 --> 00:17:23.785
I know that kid is a real pain in the ass,

00:17:24.825 --> 00:17:27.825
but if you handle it like that,
we're the ones who'll be in trouble.

00:17:28.865 --> 00:17:32.625
I just want to test Champ to see
if he's hiding something.

00:17:33.745 --> 00:17:37.545
Threatening him like that
might've made him crack.

00:17:37.625 --> 00:17:39.425
We could get a lead out of it.

00:17:40.625 --> 00:17:42.185
Next time, you should be careful.

00:17:44.945 --> 00:17:46.265
Don't worry about me.

00:17:48.305 --> 00:17:50.025
I'm serious.

00:17:51.265 --> 00:17:52.945
If something happens to you,

00:17:53.665 --> 00:17:55.025
how am I supposed to live?

00:17:59.905 --> 00:18:03.705
All right. I'll take care of myself.

00:18:07.625 --> 00:18:11.345
Let's request a warrant
to search Puifai's house.

00:18:12.505 --> 00:18:13.385
Got it.

00:18:37.185 --> 00:18:38.705
We agreed to meet yesterday.
Why didn't you show up?

00:18:38.785 --> 00:18:41.025
There were cops everywhere.

00:18:41.105 --> 00:18:42.745
How was I supposed to get in?

00:18:43.425 --> 00:18:44.745
Can you come see me today?

00:18:45.505 --> 00:18:46.705
It's important.

00:18:49.225 --> 00:18:51.385
Puifai and Tar are dead.

00:18:51.465 --> 00:18:53.185
Aren't you scared at all?

00:18:54.945 --> 00:18:56.865
If you have something to say, say it now.

00:18:56.945 --> 00:18:58.585
On the day Puifai died,

00:18:59.385 --> 00:19:00.945
what drugs did you trade with her?

00:19:08.345 --> 00:19:09.185
So?

00:19:11.145 --> 00:19:12.225
Nothing.

00:19:12.305 --> 00:19:13.985
Just tell me.

00:19:14.065 --> 00:19:16.745
Even if you did something to Puifai,
I won't blame you.

00:19:16.825 --> 00:19:18.905
I told you I didn't do anything.

00:19:20.065 --> 00:19:21.345
If you don't tell me the truth,

00:19:22.025 --> 00:19:23.705
and something happens to you next,

00:19:24.945 --> 00:19:26.585
I won't be able to help you in time, girl.

00:19:31.145 --> 00:19:32.305
Well…

00:19:36.985 --> 00:19:38.945
Puifai asked me to prank everyone.

00:19:44.145 --> 00:19:46.265
I never thought she'd actually die.

00:19:46.865 --> 00:19:48.985
But I didn't do it.

00:19:49.065 --> 00:19:50.905
I didn't kill Puifai!

00:19:50.985 --> 00:19:52.305
Okay.

00:19:52.385 --> 00:19:54.105
I'll protect you.

00:20:02.105 --> 00:20:04.025
Inspector, is Captain not here?

00:20:05.505 --> 00:20:07.625
He's in the shower. Is something wrong?

00:20:07.705 --> 00:20:09.585
I'm here to report on the kids.

00:20:10.385 --> 00:20:11.505
Have a seat.

00:20:18.785 --> 00:20:23.145
Students at the university said a girl
named Bell doesn't have many friends.

00:20:23.225 --> 00:20:25.105
She often gets into fights.

00:20:25.625 --> 00:20:28.545
As for Champ and Cherreen,
Sergeant Chai followed them.

00:20:28.625 --> 00:20:29.865
They go home as usual.

00:20:38.465 --> 00:20:39.785
Together,

00:20:41.905 --> 00:20:43.145
and then they split up?

00:20:43.225 --> 00:20:47.425
-What about the others?
-Time and Jay have a lot of activities.

00:20:47.505 --> 00:20:49.825
They're good-looking,
so they're popular on campus.

00:20:49.905 --> 00:20:52.665
But from what I've seen so far,
there's nothing suspicious.

00:20:52.745 --> 00:20:55.985
Tonkla works at a garage.

00:20:56.065 --> 00:20:59.145
I saw him on the phone, looking tense.

00:20:59.225 --> 00:21:00.465
And I heard him say,

00:21:00.545 --> 00:21:03.785
"If you don't tell me the truth, I won't
be able to help you in time, girl."

00:21:04.825 --> 00:21:05.945
Did he mention "girl"?

00:21:06.865 --> 00:21:08.385
That means

00:21:08.465 --> 00:21:10.865
the person he was speaking to was female.

00:21:10.945 --> 00:21:13.185
Get me all his call records.

00:21:13.265 --> 00:21:14.865
I want to know who he was talking to.

00:21:22.985 --> 00:21:23.825
Captain.

00:21:32.785 --> 00:21:33.945
Captain.

00:21:38.945 --> 00:21:41.425
I've already requested a warrant
to search Puifai's house.

00:21:42.105 --> 00:21:43.465
Is there something wrong?

00:21:45.545 --> 00:21:46.785
That was a long shower.

00:21:47.465 --> 00:21:48.865
If you're in a hurry,

00:21:49.465 --> 00:21:51.065
do you want to come and shower for me?

00:21:51.145 --> 00:21:52.345
Get dressed. Now.

00:21:53.945 --> 00:21:56.345
You can tell me anything.
I won't hold it against you.

00:21:56.425 --> 00:21:58.705
You've got five minutes.

00:21:58.785 --> 00:22:01.105
Hurry and get dressed.
I'm taking you to investigate.

00:22:01.185 --> 00:22:03.785
Inspector, warrants don't work like that.

00:22:03.865 --> 00:22:05.465
You can't just get one instantly.

00:22:05.545 --> 00:22:07.745
We're going to investigate Tonkla.

00:22:09.745 --> 00:22:10.825
Tonkla?

00:22:12.265 --> 00:22:14.905
Lieutenant Ken had teams
checking on the kids.

00:22:14.985 --> 00:22:17.505
Tonkla's the most suspicious one.

00:22:18.105 --> 00:22:19.225
Stop messing around.

00:22:19.785 --> 00:22:20.985
Go get dressed.

00:22:23.425 --> 00:22:24.865
If I mess around,

00:22:26.025 --> 00:22:27.865
your heart races, right?

00:22:36.265 --> 00:22:40.505
Why are you so full of yourself?

00:22:40.585 --> 00:22:41.425
Inspector!

00:22:46.425 --> 00:22:47.425
Inspector!

00:22:51.345 --> 00:22:52.625
Please give this to Captain.

00:22:55.145 --> 00:22:56.105
Inspector!

00:22:59.305 --> 00:23:00.225
Give it to me.

00:23:01.225 --> 00:23:02.305
Damn it!

00:23:03.625 --> 00:23:04.505
What is it, Jay?

00:23:04.585 --> 00:23:07.585
Kamin, Tonkla has received a letter.

00:23:07.665 --> 00:23:09.465
I can't reach him right now.

00:23:17.745 --> 00:23:18.985
It's been two months, asshole!

00:23:19.065 --> 00:23:20.425
I'll pay you back, bro!

00:23:20.505 --> 00:23:21.665
I swear I'll pay you back!

00:23:21.745 --> 00:23:22.705
Hey! Police!

00:23:23.305 --> 00:23:24.585
-What are you doing?
-Tonkla!

00:23:24.665 --> 00:23:26.345
Hey! Don't run!

00:23:26.425 --> 00:23:27.265
Hey!

00:23:29.665 --> 00:23:30.945
-Are you okay?
-Are you all right?

00:23:31.025 --> 00:23:32.905
Tonkla, are you okay?

00:23:35.625 --> 00:23:36.545
What happened?

00:23:36.625 --> 00:23:38.105
Two hundred thousand baht.

00:23:39.025 --> 00:23:40.465
Did it really have to come to this?

00:23:40.545 --> 00:23:42.505
That's how loan sharks work.

00:23:43.105 --> 00:23:44.505
Why didn't you report it to the police?

00:23:44.585 --> 00:23:48.225
And if I did,
what would you do to help me?

00:23:48.745 --> 00:23:50.625
Jay said you received a letter, right?

00:23:55.545 --> 00:23:56.585
Give it to me.

00:24:12.105 --> 00:24:15.065
Is it true you knew what your friends did

00:24:15.145 --> 00:24:16.905
and you did nothing?

00:24:16.985 --> 00:24:20.065
You knew Champ cheated on exams
and let him copy.

00:24:20.665 --> 00:24:22.825
You knew Tar drugged women and raped them,

00:24:23.625 --> 00:24:24.945
but you kept quiet in exchange for drinks.

00:24:26.945 --> 00:24:29.825
You knew Bell assaulted a girl
who got close to her boyfriend.

00:24:29.905 --> 00:24:31.105
Bitch!

00:24:31.185 --> 00:24:32.185
Are you that damn horny?

00:24:32.265 --> 00:24:34.545
You stayed silent because
you liked her coming on to you.

00:24:34.625 --> 00:24:36.425
You sold out your friends for cash.

00:24:36.505 --> 00:24:37.985
You almost got me killed.

00:24:38.065 --> 00:24:39.585
But you bought your way out.

00:24:39.665 --> 00:24:42.265
People like you can be bought
with money, right?

00:24:46.065 --> 00:24:48.065
I did steal. That part is true.

00:24:48.665 --> 00:24:50.105
But I didn't do the rest.

00:24:50.705 --> 00:24:51.785
That's all the letter says?

00:24:51.865 --> 00:24:53.185
Yeah.

00:24:53.265 --> 00:24:55.465
-What else do you expect?
-Stop being such a pain.

00:24:56.105 --> 00:24:57.345
We're trying to help you here.

00:24:57.425 --> 00:24:59.385
Stop acting like I killed someone.

00:24:59.905 --> 00:25:01.185
I may be broke,

00:25:01.265 --> 00:25:03.545
but I'm not so low as to kill someone.

00:25:04.145 --> 00:25:05.345
We'll know once the questioning starts.

00:25:06.225 --> 00:25:08.065
For now, pack your things.

00:25:08.145 --> 00:25:10.105
You'll give a statement
at the station tomorrow.

00:25:14.385 --> 00:25:17.905
I'll take the letter for examination.

00:25:18.785 --> 00:25:20.465
But you shouldn't stay alone.

00:25:20.545 --> 00:25:21.425
It's dangerous.

00:25:21.505 --> 00:25:24.025
Because of the letter and the loan sharks.

00:25:24.105 --> 00:25:26.185
Do you have family
or someone close with you?

00:25:26.265 --> 00:25:27.425
I can stay by myself.

00:25:27.505 --> 00:25:29.505
Two of your friends are dead already.

00:25:30.265 --> 00:25:31.345
Aren't you scared at all?

00:25:31.945 --> 00:25:33.305
Of course I'm scared.

00:25:33.385 --> 00:25:34.745
But what can I do about it?

00:25:37.665 --> 00:25:38.705
All right then.

00:25:38.785 --> 00:25:43.105
I'll send officers to check on you
every two hours.

00:25:43.705 --> 00:25:45.865
Until then, don't go anywhere.

00:25:47.265 --> 00:25:48.305
So what now?

00:25:48.385 --> 00:25:49.905
Are we heading back together?

00:25:49.985 --> 00:25:52.185
I'll help him clean up first.
I'll catch up later.

00:25:53.105 --> 00:25:54.105
Okay.

00:26:07.945 --> 00:26:09.465
Tonkla didn't tell us everything.

00:26:15.825 --> 00:26:19.185
He doesn't have a Dare letter.

00:26:19.945 --> 00:26:21.105
Apart from that,

00:26:21.705 --> 00:26:23.025
something feels off about the room.

00:26:25.185 --> 00:26:27.505
The places that were searched had nothing.

00:26:31.585 --> 00:26:33.745
If loan sharks came,

00:26:33.825 --> 00:26:35.705
they'd take the laptop
and valuables first.

00:26:36.305 --> 00:26:37.585
You think Tonkla staged it?

00:26:38.225 --> 00:26:39.425
Yeah.

00:26:39.505 --> 00:26:41.705
He doesn't have that much money.

00:26:41.785 --> 00:26:43.545
He's scared his stuff will be damaged.

00:26:45.065 --> 00:26:48.705
The question is why lie to us?

00:26:49.745 --> 00:26:50.905
If I had to guess,

00:26:55.065 --> 00:26:56.745
it's about the Dare letter.

00:26:57.665 --> 00:27:00.545
He probably has two letters
and is hiding one from us.

00:27:03.625 --> 00:27:04.465
Then…

00:27:06.985 --> 00:27:08.185
we need to talk to Jay.

00:27:14.545 --> 00:27:16.025
Let's meet at the rice-porridge shop.

00:27:29.745 --> 00:27:32.425
Don't stress about the money.
I've got some savings.

00:27:33.145 --> 00:27:34.745
Do you want to use it
to pay the interest first?

00:27:34.825 --> 00:27:36.385
I'm not worried about money.

00:27:39.705 --> 00:27:42.745
But are we really going to die?

00:27:42.825 --> 00:27:44.585
What are you talking about?

00:27:50.345 --> 00:27:52.865
Jay, I told you to eat more vegetables.

00:27:52.945 --> 00:27:54.145
For fuck's sake, what now?

00:27:54.225 --> 00:27:57.585
-If you don't eat them, your intestines…
-Then eat them yourself, asshole!

00:27:57.665 --> 00:27:59.545
I don't like them. Stop forcing me.

00:27:59.625 --> 00:28:01.865
When you were constipated,
I took you to the doctor.

00:28:01.945 --> 00:28:03.265
-None of your business!
-What?

00:28:03.345 --> 00:28:04.985
-I didn't ask for that.
-Hey, you guys.

00:28:05.065 --> 00:28:07.225
Eat like civilized people, okay?

00:28:08.065 --> 00:28:09.625
Can't you do that?

00:28:09.705 --> 00:28:11.185
Why are you always fighting?

00:28:12.185 --> 00:28:15.505
Ask Jade.
I can't even enjoy my meal because of him.

00:28:15.585 --> 00:28:16.625
Oh, now it's me again.

00:28:32.985 --> 00:28:34.305
You dragged me out to eat,

00:28:34.385 --> 00:28:36.585
and then sit here staring at me like this.

00:28:36.665 --> 00:28:38.185
Are you trying to get something out of me?

00:28:45.025 --> 00:28:46.265
Just so you know,

00:28:47.625 --> 00:28:48.945
the more you hide things,

00:28:50.065 --> 00:28:52.025
the longer it takes us
to catch the killer.

00:28:52.665 --> 00:28:54.465
And the harder it is for us,

00:28:55.665 --> 00:28:58.825
the ones in danger are your friends.

00:29:00.665 --> 00:29:01.625
Can you promise me

00:29:02.825 --> 00:29:04.745
you won't tell your brother about this?

00:29:18.985 --> 00:29:21.065
Well, there's nothing to tell.

00:29:22.825 --> 00:29:24.745
The Inspector warned you.
Why won't you talk?

00:29:24.825 --> 00:29:26.025
There's nothing to say.

00:29:26.105 --> 00:29:28.465
What more do you want?
You're annoying as hell.

00:29:33.905 --> 00:29:35.225
I'll be right back.

00:29:46.505 --> 00:29:47.905
I've already emailed you.

00:29:47.985 --> 00:29:51.425
With incidents happening back-to-back,
you must be exhausted, Inspector.

00:29:52.185 --> 00:29:54.065
About as exhausted as
Special Investigations.

00:29:54.145 --> 00:29:57.105
About the ketamine
and phencyclidine you found,

00:29:57.185 --> 00:30:01.585
I think it's connected to a club network
in Bangkok that we're investigating.

00:30:01.665 --> 00:30:02.785
They're major dealers.

00:30:02.865 --> 00:30:05.145
High-ranking politicians
and cops are involved.

00:30:05.225 --> 00:30:08.305
If this gets exposed,
a lot of people are going down.

00:30:08.385 --> 00:30:11.545
I'll handle the club lead.

00:30:12.065 --> 00:30:14.345
Right now,
I've got another case overlapping.

00:30:14.425 --> 00:30:16.265
I'll deal with it fast.

00:30:22.225 --> 00:30:23.065
Hey!

00:30:24.345 --> 00:30:26.145
Where are you going?
You're that damn nosy, huh?

00:30:26.705 --> 00:30:27.985
Where the hell are you going?

00:30:33.305 --> 00:30:34.785
Who the hell are you guys?

00:30:34.865 --> 00:30:36.465
You're curious?
Take a punch for an answer!

00:30:39.065 --> 00:30:39.905
Hey!

00:30:40.745 --> 00:30:41.825
What the hell?

00:30:41.905 --> 00:30:43.225
You're ganging up on him?

00:30:51.745 --> 00:30:52.825
Kamin!

00:31:00.025 --> 00:31:01.985
Hey! Stop what you're doing already!

00:31:02.065 --> 00:31:04.145
This is just a warning, asshole!

00:31:04.225 --> 00:31:05.585
Let's go!

00:31:07.865 --> 00:31:09.345
Kamin!

00:31:09.425 --> 00:31:10.985
Kamin, are you okay?

00:31:14.065 --> 00:31:15.345
Are you hurt badly?

00:31:19.065 --> 00:31:20.745
Let's hold the wound first.

00:31:25.505 --> 00:31:27.505
The bleeding won't stop.

00:31:40.265 --> 00:31:43.505
Ken, check every CCTV camera.

00:31:44.305 --> 00:31:45.865
I'll handle all those bastards.

00:31:54.145 --> 00:31:56.025
I'm fine, Captain.

00:31:57.465 --> 00:31:59.305
Let Ken use his time on something else.

00:31:59.385 --> 00:32:00.545
No.

00:32:00.625 --> 00:32:02.745
It's obvious they meant to hurt you.

00:32:02.825 --> 00:32:04.705
But you got there in time, didn't you?

00:32:06.705 --> 00:32:07.705
Yeah.

00:32:07.785 --> 00:32:09.705
And that's a good thing, isn't it?

00:32:15.585 --> 00:32:17.985
Do you think this was MP Ratana's doing?

00:32:18.065 --> 00:32:21.585
With a mouth like mine,
I make enemies everywhere.

00:32:23.265 --> 00:32:26.425
By the way, did Jay say anything else?

00:32:27.665 --> 00:32:29.185
Get some rest.

00:32:29.265 --> 00:32:30.985
You're always working.

00:32:31.705 --> 00:32:33.345
You promised already.

00:32:33.425 --> 00:32:35.145
No work talk at home.

00:32:36.705 --> 00:32:38.505
I haven't signed the contract yet,

00:32:39.345 --> 00:32:40.665
so I can talk about work.

00:32:59.265 --> 00:33:00.625
Are you hurt badly, Kamin?

00:33:01.545 --> 00:33:02.665
I'm okay.

00:33:03.225 --> 00:33:04.305
The wound's been treated.

00:33:04.385 --> 00:33:05.865
Can I talk to you

00:33:07.545 --> 00:33:09.105
for a minute, Jay?

00:33:13.425 --> 00:33:14.825
You see it now, right?

00:33:15.865 --> 00:33:17.505
Things are getting worse.

00:33:19.425 --> 00:33:21.345
If I tell you,

00:33:23.505 --> 00:33:25.425
you won't send Tonkla to prison, right?

00:33:25.505 --> 00:33:27.345
Jay, stop stalling.

00:33:27.425 --> 00:33:29.025
If you know something, say it.

00:33:29.105 --> 00:33:30.185
-Captain!
-Say it!

00:33:30.265 --> 00:33:32.505
Captain, easy.

00:33:33.345 --> 00:33:36.185
If you can't talk properly, wait outside.

00:33:39.625 --> 00:33:40.465
Jay,

00:33:41.465 --> 00:33:44.465
even police like me got attacked.

00:33:45.305 --> 00:33:47.145
If you don't tell me,

00:33:47.225 --> 00:33:48.745
Tonkla or the others

00:33:49.305 --> 00:33:51.225
are in real danger.

00:33:54.225 --> 00:33:56.225
It could be fatal.

00:34:00.785 --> 00:34:01.945
The truth is…

00:34:04.225 --> 00:34:08.105
the letter came with a flash drive.

00:34:11.865 --> 00:34:14.065
It's a clip of Tonkla stealing
a customer's car.

00:34:17.945 --> 00:34:19.465
Did you really do this?

00:34:20.065 --> 00:34:21.225
I know I fucked up,

00:34:21.905 --> 00:34:25.264
but I didn't know what to do.

00:34:25.344 --> 00:34:26.185
I just…

00:34:27.185 --> 00:34:28.304
I just panicked.

00:34:28.385 --> 00:34:29.985
So you lied to the police?

00:34:30.065 --> 00:34:31.585
Do you want me in prison?

00:34:32.264 --> 00:34:35.465
I don't have a cop brother
or an MP as a dad like Champ.

00:34:35.545 --> 00:34:36.545
Kla!

00:34:40.705 --> 00:34:42.065
Who else knows about this?

00:34:42.985 --> 00:34:43.865
Just Champ.

00:34:43.945 --> 00:34:45.105
He helped me.

00:34:45.705 --> 00:34:47.304
So you traded secrets with him,

00:34:48.105 --> 00:34:50.385
covering up his exam cheating, right?

00:34:53.705 --> 00:34:55.465
But Tonkla really didn't mean it.

00:34:56.344 --> 00:34:58.425
You can love and protect your friend,

00:34:58.505 --> 00:34:59.745
but there have to be limits.

00:34:59.825 --> 00:35:01.225
I know it's wrong, damn it.

00:35:02.385 --> 00:35:04.185
But if it were your friend,
wouldn't you help?

00:35:04.265 --> 00:35:05.105
I would,

00:35:06.505 --> 00:35:07.745
but not like this.

00:35:09.385 --> 00:35:11.065
The Dare letter.

00:35:11.705 --> 00:35:12.625
What about it?

00:35:13.225 --> 00:35:14.545
As for the letters,

00:35:15.385 --> 00:35:18.385
there are Truth and Dare.

00:35:19.705 --> 00:35:21.025
But Tonkla

00:35:24.385 --> 00:35:25.625
only gave me the Truth one.

00:35:26.465 --> 00:35:28.385
As far as he told me,
that's all there was.

00:35:33.305 --> 00:35:36.345
Where did you get that photo?

00:35:37.105 --> 00:35:39.505
Time took it back in freshman year.

00:35:44.065 --> 00:35:45.545
You work at home too?

00:35:50.865 --> 00:35:55.145
I want to know
what the killer's motive is.

00:35:57.145 --> 00:35:58.305
SLEEPS AROUND, DRUG ADDICTION

00:35:58.385 --> 00:36:00.505
THEFT, DRIVEN FOR MONEY

00:36:00.585 --> 00:36:01.625
PHYSICAL ASSAULT, VIOLENCE

00:36:02.225 --> 00:36:03.585
After Tonkla,

00:36:04.785 --> 00:36:06.345
who do you think the next target will be?

00:36:06.425 --> 00:36:10.025
The one who seems most violent

00:36:12.385 --> 00:36:13.265
would be Bell.

00:36:13.345 --> 00:36:19.265
SUSPICIOUS

00:36:42.785 --> 00:36:44.545
What the hell is this?

00:36:45.545 --> 00:36:46.865
IS IT TRUE YOU THREW ACID ON A GIRL?

00:36:46.945 --> 00:36:49.105
IS IT TRUE YOU DRAGGED A FRIEND
INTO GETTING AN ABORTION,

00:36:49.185 --> 00:36:50.625
ENDING A LIFE BEFORE IT EVEN BEGAN?

00:36:50.705 --> 00:36:52.265
FAKE CAMPUS STAR FITS YOU PERFECTLY.

00:37:06.985 --> 00:37:08.785
Cherreen, answer me, bitch!

00:37:11.065 --> 00:37:12.585
Bitch!

00:37:12.665 --> 00:37:14.105
What sick game are you playing?

00:37:14.705 --> 00:37:16.105
You want this, huh?

00:37:58.585 --> 00:37:59.745
I can do it myself.

00:38:02.785 --> 00:38:03.905
How?

00:38:05.465 --> 00:38:06.745
The wound is on your arm.

00:38:08.385 --> 00:38:11.105
You'll bite the gauze like in the movies?

00:38:12.265 --> 00:38:13.425
Let me do it.

00:38:19.545 --> 00:38:20.745
It might hurt a bit.

00:38:24.105 --> 00:38:24.945
Does it hurt?

00:38:25.545 --> 00:38:26.585
Not at all.

00:38:37.905 --> 00:38:39.025
Captain,

00:38:42.945 --> 00:38:44.185
thank you.

00:38:47.025 --> 00:38:49.825
Without you, I'd be in real trouble.

00:38:54.265 --> 00:38:55.145
Anytime.

00:38:59.505 --> 00:39:01.385
Do you want to take your shirt off?

00:39:02.425 --> 00:39:03.625
I'll apply the medicine.

00:39:04.985 --> 00:39:06.185
It's fine.

00:39:06.265 --> 00:39:08.105
It's easier all at once.

00:39:08.705 --> 00:39:09.625
No need.

00:39:09.705 --> 00:39:11.065
Come on, I'll help.

00:39:17.185 --> 00:39:18.225
Careful.

00:39:19.545 --> 00:39:20.625
Okay.

00:40:04.865 --> 00:40:05.705
Who's that?

00:40:07.025 --> 00:40:08.745
Cher? Bitch, I'm not playing.

00:40:12.065 --> 00:40:13.105
Cher!

00:40:14.385 --> 00:40:16.105
You love messing with me, huh?

00:40:24.705 --> 00:40:25.665
Truth or dare?

00:40:26.545 --> 00:40:27.985
Who are you?

00:40:28.065 --> 00:40:29.785
What do you want from me?

00:40:29.865 --> 00:40:31.225
Get out

00:40:32.105 --> 00:40:33.785
or I'll call the police!

00:40:47.105 --> 00:40:49.425
Please! Let me go! Let me go.

00:40:49.505 --> 00:40:51.945
I already chose dare. I chose dare!

00:40:52.025 --> 00:40:53.145
-I chose Cherreen!
-Shut up!

00:40:56.265 --> 00:40:57.425
It's too late.

00:41:00.705 --> 00:41:02.505
Someone else chose you.

00:41:04.105 --> 00:41:05.265
Who?

00:41:06.185 --> 00:41:07.585
Who chose me?

00:41:10.305 --> 00:41:13.825
This is how it feels before you die.

00:41:15.425 --> 00:41:18.625
It's the pain of being betrayed.

00:41:20.425 --> 00:41:22.305
Just like what you did to Puifai!

00:41:22.905 --> 00:41:24.025
I'm sorry!

00:41:49.105 --> 00:41:53.145
Well, tomorrow I'll follow up
on the search warrant for Puifai's house.

00:41:53.665 --> 00:41:55.505
If Tar and Tonkla got letters,

00:41:57.265 --> 00:41:58.665
Puifai must have gotten one too.

00:41:59.545 --> 00:42:01.465
You can let your team
handle that small task.

00:42:03.185 --> 00:42:04.505
I can do it for you.

00:42:06.025 --> 00:42:07.305
Actually,

00:42:09.345 --> 00:42:12.025
you should just focus on
dressing the wound.

00:42:15.025 --> 00:42:16.705
But if you're so worried about me,

00:42:18.025 --> 00:42:19.785
look into Bell tomorrow

00:42:20.745 --> 00:42:22.865
and follow up the scene evidence.

00:42:24.105 --> 00:42:25.145
Understood?

00:42:29.385 --> 00:42:30.585
Yes.

00:42:39.905 --> 00:42:41.705
You're taking too long, Captain.

00:42:42.465 --> 00:42:43.745
I can do it myself.

00:42:43.825 --> 00:42:45.785
I'm doing it carefully here.

00:42:47.785 --> 00:42:49.585
A tough Captain like you

00:42:51.065 --> 00:42:52.585
never dressed your own wounds?

00:43:04.585 --> 00:43:06.105
I don't care about my own wounds.

00:43:08.065 --> 00:43:12.225
You're the first I've treated

00:43:15.545 --> 00:43:17.745
and gotten this worked up
over a small cut.

00:44:24.105 --> 00:44:25.105
Hey.

00:44:27.385 --> 00:44:29.385
Do you think the two of us

00:44:30.105 --> 00:44:34.105
could be more than coworkers?

00:44:40.345 --> 00:44:43.225
No. That's not what I meant.

00:44:44.105 --> 00:44:46.585
Besides, I don't like buffets.

00:44:51.665 --> 00:44:53.185
Hypothetically,

00:44:53.265 --> 00:44:59.145
one day you lose control
and start liking me.

00:45:02.665 --> 00:45:05.825
You and me? No way.

00:45:05.905 --> 00:45:07.105
Why not?

00:45:07.185 --> 00:45:08.865
We're both single.

00:45:08.945 --> 00:45:11.105
We're together all the time.

00:45:11.185 --> 00:45:13.745
I'm pretty handsome.

00:45:14.545 --> 00:45:16.265
Wouldn't you fall for me for a bit?

00:45:16.345 --> 00:45:18.145
If I had to like you,

00:45:19.345 --> 00:45:20.825
I'd rather like a dog.

00:45:22.945 --> 00:45:24.305
Wow, Inspector.

00:45:25.225 --> 00:45:27.105
So sharp-tongued, huh?

00:45:27.185 --> 00:45:28.665
Which breed then?

00:45:28.745 --> 00:45:31.065
Doberman? Golden retriever?

00:45:32.945 --> 00:45:34.665
Or a little puppy?

00:45:35.865 --> 00:45:36.745
Temple dog.

00:45:42.945 --> 00:45:44.145
You just killed the mood.

00:45:45.545 --> 00:45:47.265
Are there temple dogs in the US?

00:45:52.225 --> 00:45:53.745
I think Bell is in danger.

00:45:59.705 --> 00:46:02.385
Kamin. Are you really going to act like
nothing happened?

00:46:02.465 --> 00:46:03.985
If you're so distracted,

00:46:04.065 --> 00:46:05.545
shouldn't you get
a search warrant instead?

00:46:07.265 --> 00:46:08.545
Here you are. A mask.

00:46:08.625 --> 00:46:10.505
Just in case there are
hazardous substances inside.

00:46:11.025 --> 00:46:14.265
But when we're on duty,
try to be professional, okay?

00:46:14.345 --> 00:46:16.105
Watch yourself.

00:46:16.185 --> 00:46:17.985
You might be the one who cannot handle it.
