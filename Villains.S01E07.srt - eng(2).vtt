00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.947
ALL CHARACTERS, PLACES, AND EVENTS
IN THIS WORK ARE FICTITIOUS

00:00:31.823 --> 00:00:32.949
NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE SERVICE

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.618
NIS DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

00:00:36.661 --> 00:00:39.122
DIRECTOR OH GI-HWAN

00:00:47.464 --> 00:00:48.465
EUL SOCIETY ROSTER

00:00:54.429 --> 00:00:56.056
DIRECTOR'S OFFICE

00:00:57.515 --> 00:00:58.516
Deputy Director Ma.

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:03.271
Have you heard of the Eul Society?

00:01:05.356 --> 00:01:09.486
I only know it's a social club
for high-ranking political figures.

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:13.281
I heard many descendants
of collaborators are members.

00:01:13.615 --> 00:01:14.616
Then (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:18.536
do you know what kind of project
the Eul Society is pushing?

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:22.373
I've heard some political gossip

00:01:22.457 --> 00:01:24.626
but who would believe
such a baseless rumor?

00:01:27.837 --> 00:01:30.965
I'll get straight to the point.

00:01:31.508 --> 00:01:33.384
I received a decisive document.

00:01:33.468 --> 00:01:37.222
A list of Eul Society members
and a record of what they've done.

00:01:37.305 --> 00:01:38.473
Who would...

00:01:38.556 --> 00:01:43.520
It said the group laundered
500 billion won through KC Bank.

00:01:45.021 --> 00:01:47.148
If the member list leaks

00:01:47.982 --> 00:01:49.901
it won't just be a scandal.

00:01:49.984 --> 00:01:51.986
The country will fall into chaos.

00:01:53.530 --> 00:01:55.115
Just who are the members?

00:01:58.201 --> 00:02:02.622
My influence in that organization is
somewhere in the middle.

00:02:02.956 --> 00:02:04.165
Let's put it that way.

00:02:41.953 --> 00:02:44.080
Everyone opposed it,
saying you were some loan shark

00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:45.540
without a pedigree.

00:02:45.957 --> 00:02:48.084
And I took the heat
and recommended you.

00:02:48.168 --> 00:02:49.169
And

00:02:49.878 --> 00:02:52.213
what makes you think
you can stab us in the back?

00:02:52.839 --> 00:02:54.799
Because you didn't trust us

00:02:54.883 --> 00:02:56.342
you collected and kept that ledger

00:02:56.426 --> 00:02:58.803
and those photos
on a flash drive, didn't you?

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.722
An uncopyable flash drive.

00:03:00.805 --> 00:03:02.265
You really came prepared.

00:03:02.724 --> 00:03:06.186
The money to make
Eul Society's chosen man a candidate

00:03:06.603 --> 00:03:10.565
and get him into the Blue House
can't come from clean funds.

00:03:10.648 --> 00:03:13.568
That's why you picked me,
a guy who plays in the shadows.

00:03:13.902 --> 00:03:15.361
That's right.

00:03:15.612 --> 00:03:20.575
But just what were you thinking,
collecting evidence to backstab us?

00:03:21.492 --> 00:03:25.914
Everyone here is
a so-called leader of society

00:03:25.997 --> 00:03:28.166
each with a firm grip
on their own field.

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:30.210
Like you said, Representative Choi

00:03:30.293 --> 00:03:33.046
I'm just a loan shark
with no pedigree.

00:03:33.421 --> 00:03:35.381
If we create a president

00:03:35.465 --> 00:03:36.799
is there any guarantee

00:03:36.883 --> 00:03:39.260
you'll make me
head of Woorim Financial Group?

00:03:39.344 --> 00:03:41.554
If people around you oppose it

00:03:41.638 --> 00:03:44.682
is anyone here going to step up
and take the bullets for me?

00:03:44.766 --> 00:03:47.644
So you kept the evidence
as an insurance policy?

00:03:47.727 --> 00:03:48.853
That's right.

00:03:49.938 --> 00:03:52.315
- Come on.
- I put my life into the work.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:55.318
I didn't want to get thrown away
the moment I was no longer useful

00:03:55.652 --> 00:03:57.862
so I secured leverage.

00:03:58.363 --> 00:03:59.614
Also

00:03:59.697 --> 00:04:02.367
once you keep your promise,
it's automatically destroyed.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:05.286
Don't tell me
you're afraid of such insurance.

00:04:09.499 --> 00:04:12.669
We struggled to build a front-runner

00:04:12.752 --> 00:04:15.004
and now we're close
to taking back first place.

00:04:15.797 --> 00:04:18.174
If you dump me now...

00:04:22.303 --> 00:04:25.848
who's going to raise the money
for the remaining race?

00:04:25.932 --> 00:04:26.933
So?

00:04:29.060 --> 00:04:31.688
By when can you secure the funds?

00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:35.191
Well...

00:04:35.275 --> 00:04:39.279
Whether or not the funds are secured
will determine your value.

00:04:39.612 --> 00:04:41.656
And if that flash drive leaks

00:04:42.282 --> 00:04:45.493
I can't guarantee your position.

00:04:52.667 --> 00:04:53.793
The truth is

00:04:55.086 --> 00:04:57.880
that 500 billion was
supposed to come into my hands.

00:05:00.133 --> 00:05:01.134
But

00:05:01.676 --> 00:05:03.303
it looks like Jang Joong-hyuk

00:05:04.429 --> 00:05:06.014
pulled a stunt.

00:05:06.806 --> 00:05:09.600
I believe he's also the one
who touched my safe-deposit box.

00:05:12.478 --> 00:05:15.315
That's why I told you repeatedly.

00:05:15.773 --> 00:05:18.609
A wolf can never become a dog.

00:05:20.236 --> 00:05:22.530
I'll sketch the plan.

00:05:22.613 --> 00:05:24.615
The result is on you, Chairman Bang.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.163
EPISODE 7:
UNDERCOVER; A HIDDEN TRUTH

00:05:38.129 --> 00:05:40.048
There was a carpet
that hadn't been there before

00:05:40.131 --> 00:05:41.382
so I got a bad feeling and moved it.

00:05:41.466 --> 00:05:42.508
This is what I found.

00:05:46.888 --> 00:05:48.514
How did they rob the vault?

00:05:48.598 --> 00:05:50.016
It's biometric access

00:05:50.099 --> 00:05:52.143
with a real-time
self-generating passcode system.

00:05:52.226 --> 00:05:53.227
Unbelievable.

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:15.291
Sir.

00:06:33.726 --> 00:06:34.894
CHIEF'S OFFICE,
INCHEON JUNG-GU POLICE STATION

00:06:34.977 --> 00:06:36.104
You could have called for me.

00:06:36.187 --> 00:06:37.688
I didn't expect you to come here.

00:06:39.607 --> 00:06:42.360
I heard you're very interested
in our organization.

00:06:42.777 --> 00:06:43.778
Yes.

00:06:44.153 --> 00:06:47.865
I thought I might be able to help,
so I knocked a few times

00:06:47.949 --> 00:06:50.535
but I guess I wasn't qualified.
I never got a response.

00:06:53.413 --> 00:06:56.999
Do opportunities just fall
into your lap if you sit around?

00:06:57.792 --> 00:07:00.002
As for the mess
Jang Joong-hyuk caused

00:07:00.086 --> 00:07:02.505
I already took swift measures.

00:07:03.631 --> 00:07:04.799
You know about the drug ring boss

00:07:04.882 --> 00:07:07.927
who was shot dead in Jong-ro
in broad daylight, right?

00:07:08.886 --> 00:07:11.180
The bullet from that scene matches
the bullet recovered

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:13.724
at the Incheon
illegal gambling murder scene.

00:07:15.226 --> 00:07:17.854
Reopen that murder case properly.

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:20.314
Hold a press conference
and tell it exactly as it is.

00:07:20.398 --> 00:07:21.399
Pardon?

00:07:21.482 --> 00:07:23.401
But we already wrapped it up.

00:07:23.484 --> 00:07:26.320
Our organization wants people
who make quick decisions.

00:07:27.238 --> 00:07:29.699
If you do this job well,
I'll put in a good word for you.

00:07:30.741 --> 00:07:31.993
Yes.

00:07:32.076 --> 00:07:34.245
I understand exactly what you mean.

00:07:34.996 --> 00:07:36.664
Are you fucking serious?

00:07:36.747 --> 00:07:39.083
Why are we suddenly dropping
the investigation?

00:07:39.167 --> 00:07:42.086
Also, why does the deputy director
keep avoiding me?

00:07:44.797 --> 00:07:46.841
I can't tell you the details.

00:07:46.924 --> 00:07:51.012
We got an order
to quietly close the supernote case

00:07:51.095 --> 00:07:53.264
so you can go back
to roaming around Myeong-dong.

00:07:53.347 --> 00:07:54.348
Hey.

00:07:54.432 --> 00:07:56.267
You know the 500 billion
they sent to the Bank of Korea?

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:58.978
They were chemically treated
to look that way.

00:07:59.061 --> 00:08:00.938
If we collect samples
and run a composition test

00:08:01.022 --> 00:08:03.941
we can immediately see
that it was done artificially.

00:08:04.025 --> 00:08:06.527
Then, we have grounds to interrogate
Chairman Bang of Myeongseong.

00:08:06.611 --> 00:08:08.696
Those bills were already shredded.

00:08:08.779 --> 00:08:09.822
- What?
- And Myeongseong

00:08:10.364 --> 00:08:13.075
followed normal procedures
and got brand-new bills in exchange.

00:08:13.159 --> 00:08:14.785
Who told you to destroy the evidence?

00:08:15.286 --> 00:08:16.537
You sons of bitches.

00:08:16.621 --> 00:08:18.623
You're quick as hell with that,
you fuckers.

00:08:18.706 --> 00:08:20.208
Will you please stop swearing?

00:08:20.458 --> 00:08:22.376
Are you fucking kidding me right now?

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.837
Did you just swear at me?
Your superior?

00:08:24.921 --> 00:08:27.256
Does it look like
I'm swearing at you?

00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:29.050
Should I swear at them
who did all the dirty work?

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:31.427
- Darn you.
- What?

00:08:31.511 --> 00:08:33.012
A suspect has been wanted.

00:08:33.095 --> 00:08:35.848
The public was shocked
to learn the suspect is a mid-level

00:08:35.932 --> 00:08:37.975
Seoul Metropolitan Police officer.

00:08:38.059 --> 00:08:40.061
An urgent press conference
is now taking place

00:08:40.144 --> 00:08:42.605
at Incheon Jung-gu Police Station.

00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:44.440
Let's go live.

00:08:44.732 --> 00:08:48.694
A strong suspect in the Songwol-dong
shooting murder in Incheon

00:08:48.778 --> 00:08:50.530
has been identified
as Violent Crimes Unit Chief

00:08:51.030 --> 00:08:52.365
Jang Joong-hyuk

00:08:53.115 --> 00:08:54.283
and we're currently pursuing him.

00:08:54.367 --> 00:08:56.661
This follows
an internal investigation...

00:08:56.744 --> 00:08:58.204
They're rewriting the story.

00:09:01.707 --> 00:09:02.959
You know something, don't you?

00:09:03.668 --> 00:09:05.419
What do you mean?

00:09:06.212 --> 00:09:08.631
The reason the counterfeit case
turned around so suddenly.

00:09:13.094 --> 00:09:14.178
I don't know.

00:09:15.972 --> 00:09:18.224
Tell me.
How much do you actually know?

00:09:18.307 --> 00:09:19.850
I told you. I don't know.

00:09:20.434 --> 00:09:21.602
Tell me.

00:09:21.686 --> 00:09:22.687
How much do you know?

00:09:22.770 --> 00:09:24.605
Stop bugging me.

00:09:24.689 --> 00:09:25.690
Come on.

00:09:31.696 --> 00:09:32.822
Here's what I know.

00:09:33.322 --> 00:09:35.157
Orders came down from above

00:09:35.575 --> 00:09:39.078
to wrap this case up clean
and send you back to where you were.

00:09:41.372 --> 00:09:43.082
You can clean up the mess
on your way out.

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.001
What mess?

00:09:45.084 --> 00:09:46.252
Han Soo-hyun.

00:09:47.086 --> 00:09:49.714
It's like we started surgery
and had to stitch up halfway.

00:09:49.797 --> 00:09:52.300
What's the point of keeping her here?
We should get rid of her.

00:09:53.593 --> 00:09:54.635
That's it?

00:09:54.719 --> 00:09:57.597
That's the only reason
you're hastily releasing Han Soo-hyun

00:09:57.847 --> 00:10:00.308
the one who knows the most about J?

00:10:05.187 --> 00:10:08.983
The crew that swapped the 500 billion
for supernotes

00:10:09.734 --> 00:10:11.569
is threatening the director.

00:10:11.652 --> 00:10:13.738
That's all the deputy director said.

00:10:13.821 --> 00:10:14.822
What?

00:10:36.761 --> 00:10:37.762
Wait.

00:10:38.512 --> 00:10:39.639
Look who it is.

00:10:40.222 --> 00:10:42.558
Aren't you the guy
getting famous as a murder suspect?

00:10:43.726 --> 00:10:45.394
What made you look for me?

00:10:46.979 --> 00:10:49.482
Do you want to give me a promotion

00:10:49.565 --> 00:10:51.484
by letting me arrest you?

00:10:51.859 --> 00:10:53.361
Oh, man.

00:10:54.612 --> 00:10:58.991
Look at you.
You're barking like a damn stray dog.

00:11:01.452 --> 00:11:02.453
Jeez.

00:11:10.586 --> 00:11:11.587
Follow me.

00:11:17.134 --> 00:11:18.177
Open it.

00:11:26.686 --> 00:11:27.728
So?

00:11:28.813 --> 00:11:30.064
Does this change your mind?

00:11:31.315 --> 00:11:32.316
My goodness.

00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:33.651
Boss.

00:11:33.734 --> 00:11:37.029
I'm still hungover from yesterday.
Sorry for being so rude.

00:11:37.738 --> 00:11:40.449
You pathetic little bastard.

00:11:41.409 --> 00:11:42.660
Jeez.

00:11:42.743 --> 00:11:45.496
That's your best trait, you know.

00:11:45.871 --> 00:11:48.916
That's why I can feel at ease
leaving the work to you.

00:11:48.999 --> 00:11:51.711
- You little shit.
- Yes.

00:11:51.794 --> 00:11:53.087
You punk.

00:11:53.504 --> 00:11:55.339
That's right. That's my strength.

00:11:55.589 --> 00:11:56.674
I'll do anything!

00:11:58.509 --> 00:11:59.885
Take this, bastard.

00:12:04.098 --> 00:12:05.474
The sea routes are
all blocked now, right?

00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.103
Of course. There's a warrant out.

00:12:10.688 --> 00:12:13.357
You've been covering
for those Chinese smugglers

00:12:13.441 --> 00:12:15.192
so you're familiar
with the customs guys, right?

00:12:15.276 --> 00:12:16.360
Yes, I am.

00:12:16.944 --> 00:12:18.154
Now, listen carefully to what I say.

00:12:20.614 --> 00:12:21.615
You're going to plant it

00:12:22.742 --> 00:12:24.952
in the logistics warehouse
that I already bribed

00:12:26.203 --> 00:12:27.496
on the day of the inspection.

00:12:28.706 --> 00:12:31.167
Keep it on-site,
no matter what it takes.

00:12:37.006 --> 00:12:38.007
Before that

00:12:39.133 --> 00:12:42.261
we'll hide the money
in boxes of dried seaweed.

00:12:47.516 --> 00:12:49.769
Then you move them to China.

00:12:54.106 --> 00:12:55.483
That's a brilliant idea.

00:12:55.566 --> 00:12:56.901
How long to get it done?

00:12:56.984 --> 00:12:58.778
Money's the key.

00:12:59.528 --> 00:13:01.530
Cargo ships come and go all day long

00:13:01.614 --> 00:13:04.658
so they'll be gone in no time
if I pay the right people.

00:13:08.037 --> 00:13:09.914
What's she doing here?

00:13:10.206 --> 00:13:11.248
Right.

00:13:11.332 --> 00:13:13.793
She wanted to come
to pick up the drugs we made.

00:13:16.253 --> 00:13:17.379
Take me with you.

00:13:17.797 --> 00:13:19.715
China, the Philippines,
Thailand, wherever.

00:13:20.007 --> 00:13:21.926
With my skills,
we can make good money.

00:13:24.553 --> 00:13:25.638
You don't want to stay in school?

00:13:26.889 --> 00:13:28.766
What do I get as a famous professor?

00:13:28.849 --> 00:13:30.351
A measly 200 million won a year?

00:13:30.601 --> 00:13:33.229
And what do I have left
after 30% tax and deductions?

00:13:33.562 --> 00:13:35.523
I got into this to make money
in the first place.

00:13:46.659 --> 00:13:47.660
Do you want a smoke?

00:13:51.205 --> 00:13:52.206
Sure.

00:14:03.551 --> 00:14:04.844
She's coming with us.

00:14:22.611 --> 00:14:24.989
2 YEARS AGO

00:14:42.756 --> 00:14:44.592
How dare you show up in front of me

00:14:45.509 --> 00:14:47.261
after what you did to me?

00:14:50.556 --> 00:14:51.557
Get in.

00:14:52.391 --> 00:14:55.352
You suffered for three years.
You need some nutrients.

00:15:04.194 --> 00:15:07.114
Remember when I said
I'd get you revenge for free?

00:15:15.456 --> 00:15:17.708
Let's try the stew.

00:15:18.709 --> 00:15:19.835
That's hot.

00:15:21.045 --> 00:15:23.047
Stop glaring at me like that.

00:15:23.464 --> 00:15:26.300
If you really want to screw J over

00:15:26.383 --> 00:15:29.011
you have to drop that grudge
you have against me.

00:15:29.428 --> 00:15:32.890
Trying to fix it on your own
gets you nowhere.

00:15:34.808 --> 00:15:35.935
Eat this.

00:15:37.895 --> 00:15:40.481
Keep your head and think smart.

00:15:41.732 --> 00:15:43.776
Fine.

00:15:44.944 --> 00:15:45.986
CASINO COUNTERFEIT CASE REPORT

00:15:46.445 --> 00:15:47.529
You said you saw a Carnival

00:15:47.613 --> 00:15:49.365
and a box truck
on the way to the warehouse, right?

00:15:49.448 --> 00:15:50.658
Check out the photo.

00:15:52.159 --> 00:15:55.579
We tracked down both vehicles
and identified the drivers.

00:15:55.663 --> 00:15:57.706
It's Choi Do-sik in the Carnival.

00:15:57.790 --> 00:16:00.167
An Incheon-based drug kingpin.

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:02.169
And that mean-looking guy
in the box truck.

00:16:02.252 --> 00:16:05.255
That's Jang Joong-hyuk
from Incheon Jung-gu Police Station.

00:16:05.339 --> 00:16:07.007
- Why would a cop...
- That bastard J

00:16:07.091 --> 00:16:10.010
wanted to bail overseas
with the 30 million.

00:16:10.094 --> 00:16:12.429
He probably got together
with Joong-hyuk for that reason.

00:16:16.976 --> 00:16:17.977
Here.

00:16:20.437 --> 00:16:22.564
Exactly 13 minutes
after the warehouse blew up

00:16:22.856 --> 00:16:25.192
this security camera
a kilometer away caught it.

00:16:30.656 --> 00:16:32.324
That's the J you mean, right?

00:16:38.789 --> 00:16:39.790
Yes.

00:16:42.626 --> 00:16:43.627
So?

00:16:44.878 --> 00:16:46.547
What do you want from me?

00:16:52.886 --> 00:16:54.513
How about you and I team up?

00:16:56.557 --> 00:16:58.183
After all, we want the same thing.

00:17:07.901 --> 00:17:08.902
Did you get some rest?

00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:11.530
Did you catch J?

00:17:11.613 --> 00:17:14.616
Tell him that I'll see him next time.

00:17:16.577 --> 00:17:17.995
Show her out.

00:17:20.039 --> 00:17:21.040
What are you talking about?

00:17:23.834 --> 00:17:25.461
You're still putting on the act?

00:17:25.836 --> 00:17:26.837
What?

00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:29.423
Chemicals that turn
new bills into worn-out bills?

00:17:29.506 --> 00:17:31.675
Because of you,
I went to the Bank of Korea

00:17:31.759 --> 00:17:33.093
and made a complete ass of myself.

00:17:33.177 --> 00:17:34.303
While that was happening

00:17:34.386 --> 00:17:37.598
that bastard swapped 500 billion won
in counterfeit bills into real cash

00:17:37.681 --> 00:17:40.601
then raided Chairman Bang's safe
and took the flash drive.

00:17:40.684 --> 00:17:41.727
The flash drive?

00:17:41.810 --> 00:17:43.645
- Yes, keep acting.
- What...

00:17:44.271 --> 00:17:46.273
So what happened to J?

00:17:46.356 --> 00:17:48.817
I don't care how he swapped them.
What matters is that we catch him.

00:17:48.901 --> 00:17:51.111
How am I supposed to catch him
when you're stalling me

00:17:51.195 --> 00:17:52.654
and throwing
the whole case into chaos?

00:17:56.450 --> 00:17:57.743
I got orders to kick you out

00:17:57.826 --> 00:18:00.037
because you're a compulsive liar
and a crazy bitch.

00:18:02.164 --> 00:18:03.290
My take is different, though.

00:18:05.459 --> 00:18:06.460
Different how?

00:18:09.379 --> 00:18:10.380
You

00:18:11.465 --> 00:18:12.758
and J are partners.

00:18:15.803 --> 00:18:17.096
You guys are the same.

00:18:17.721 --> 00:18:20.682
The con artist
and the one chasing him.

00:18:21.100 --> 00:18:22.726
You use people when you need them

00:18:22.810 --> 00:18:24.561
and blame them when it falls apart.

00:18:25.187 --> 00:18:27.648
No one has the guts
to see it through.

00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:29.858
I'm leaving.

00:18:29.942 --> 00:18:32.653
Sorry for throwing
the investigation into chaos.

00:19:10.107 --> 00:19:12.943
Hired a Jung-gu Station cop
with a six-month suspension.

00:19:13.026 --> 00:19:14.736
Disguised as export seaweed.

00:19:17.364 --> 00:19:19.199
I have Dr. Choi's location.

00:19:36.466 --> 00:19:38.427
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

00:19:42.347 --> 00:19:43.348
Bring it to me.

00:19:43.432 --> 00:19:44.933
I got a text from a professor I know.

00:19:51.899 --> 00:19:52.900
Let me see it.

00:20:05.245 --> 00:20:07.206
I told you to keep the phone off

00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:09.249
until we left Korea.

00:20:10.584 --> 00:20:11.752
I apologize.

00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:57.589
Assigning the police
to Joong-hyuk's case

00:20:57.673 --> 00:21:00.759
by linking the two murders was

00:21:01.677 --> 00:21:05.430
simply a temporary measure
to blind him for a while.

00:21:05.764 --> 00:21:07.891
For the survival of the Eul Society

00:21:08.350 --> 00:21:11.103
the NIS should handle him.

00:21:13.105 --> 00:21:17.276
We were getting ready to catch him.

00:21:19.403 --> 00:21:20.404
"Catch him"?

00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:24.741
We need him dead.

00:21:29.538 --> 00:21:32.708
This isn't Namsan in the KCIA days.

00:21:32.791 --> 00:21:35.419
Do you truly believe
that's still possible these days?

00:21:35.794 --> 00:21:37.546
And if it isn't?

00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:39.506
Should we just sit back

00:21:39.589 --> 00:21:43.093
and let him decide
whether Eul Society survives or not?

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:52.936
- How about using Cha Ki-tae?
- Cha Ki-tae?

00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:55.188
He got burned for defying orders

00:21:55.272 --> 00:21:57.482
over the counterfeit 100-dollar bills
at the casino five years ago.

00:21:57.566 --> 00:21:58.567
That Cha Ki-tae.

00:22:00.152 --> 00:22:01.361
I see.

00:22:01.445 --> 00:22:04.531
He's waiting for a chance

00:22:04.990 --> 00:22:06.950
to restore his reputation
with this supernote case.

00:22:08.785 --> 00:22:11.079
We put blood on his hands?

00:22:14.166 --> 00:22:15.250
I like it.

00:23:08.678 --> 00:23:09.679
What is this?

00:23:14.810 --> 00:23:16.436
Food tastes better outside, right?

00:23:18.146 --> 00:23:19.648
Better than the slop in there.

00:23:21.149 --> 00:23:23.568
Why do you keep following me?
You're annoying.

00:23:24.277 --> 00:23:26.405
You're a VIP.
I have to provide security.

00:23:35.414 --> 00:23:36.456
J's here.

00:23:45.298 --> 00:23:46.550
Can you come right now?

00:23:46.925 --> 00:23:50.345
The heavier the object,
the more accurately it falls.

00:23:51.096 --> 00:23:55.100
A wide rectangle
won't catch air resistance.

00:23:55.725 --> 00:23:56.726
Trust me.

00:23:59.896 --> 00:24:02.732
Are you sure you'll be okay?

00:24:02.816 --> 00:24:03.942
I said I'm fine.

00:24:04.025 --> 00:24:06.111
Why do you keep asking?
I can do this.

00:24:07.988 --> 00:24:10.240
If you're going to do it,
hurry the fuck up.

00:24:26.965 --> 00:24:29.426
We're going back into the lion's den.

00:24:29.509 --> 00:24:30.844
What's the point of security?

00:24:31.761 --> 00:24:34.473
I'm still not sure
if this is the right call.

00:24:36.224 --> 00:24:39.853
We attempted to bait the lion,
but it didn't work.

00:24:39.936 --> 00:24:41.813
We have no choice
but to go primitive.

00:24:43.398 --> 00:24:46.943
It's not primitive.
It just sounds dumb. That's why.

00:24:47.694 --> 00:24:48.695
By the way

00:24:49.571 --> 00:24:51.656
are you really stepping away
from this case?

00:24:52.657 --> 00:24:53.658
Beats me.

00:24:58.038 --> 00:24:59.206
INCOMING CALL

00:25:01.082 --> 00:25:02.375
This is Cha Ki-tae.

00:25:04.419 --> 00:25:05.420
What?

00:25:06.296 --> 00:25:07.339
Okay, I'll be right there.

00:25:10.425 --> 00:25:11.676
How's the seaweed packing coming?

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:15.138
Our guys are working hard in shifts.

00:25:15.222 --> 00:25:17.557
It'll be done by dawn
if they move fast enough.

00:25:18.475 --> 00:25:20.810
- Anything unusual?
- Unusual...

00:25:23.605 --> 00:25:25.649
- What is it?
- Money surely talks.

00:25:25.732 --> 00:25:27.901
I offered 600 million won up front
and 1.2 billion in total

00:25:27.984 --> 00:25:29.819
- and they said yes immediately.
- What time?

00:25:29.903 --> 00:25:31.947
At 3 p.m.
It's the cargo ship to China.

00:25:32.197 --> 00:25:33.740
What about the Coast Guard?
Any movement?

00:25:34.032 --> 00:25:35.033
Oh, please.

00:25:35.116 --> 00:25:38.620
Even the Coast Guard
doesn't inspect ships that massive.

00:25:40.080 --> 00:25:42.332
Don't let your guard down.
Finish the job clean.

00:25:42.415 --> 00:25:43.416
Yes, sir.

00:25:44.584 --> 00:25:46.836
It's going faster than I expected.

00:25:46.920 --> 00:25:47.921
Yes.

00:25:48.713 --> 00:25:51.216
We leave here at 7 a.m. tomorrow

00:25:51.299 --> 00:25:53.260
- so have everything ready.
- Yes, sir.

00:25:54.761 --> 00:25:55.762
Dr. Choi.

00:25:56.388 --> 00:25:57.722
Bring me a bottle of water.

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:00.642
Oh, sure.

00:26:07.899 --> 00:26:08.900
Also

00:26:09.442 --> 00:26:11.319
to the Incheon Port
container terminal

00:26:12.070 --> 00:26:14.990
we're using waterways, not roads.

00:26:15.574 --> 00:26:17.993
We depart from Mujoo Dock
on Yeongjong Island

00:26:18.076 --> 00:26:20.328
and go straight to the Incheon Port
container terminal.

00:26:20.579 --> 00:26:22.664
Before 8 a.m. tomorrow

00:26:22.747 --> 00:26:26.501
we need to move the box truck
with the 500 billion to Mujoo Dock.

00:26:26.585 --> 00:26:28.587
Transfer them onto a fishing boat
within an hour

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:31.047
and move them to the Incheon Port
container terminal.

00:26:31.131 --> 00:26:32.215
Yes, understood.

00:26:32.841 --> 00:26:34.593
Is there anything I can do to help?

00:26:36.928 --> 00:26:38.221
It's all heavy lifting.

00:26:38.930 --> 00:26:40.599
What would
a high-level specialist like you do?

00:26:41.600 --> 00:26:44.686
You just stay glued to my side.

00:26:45.103 --> 00:26:46.104
Okay.

00:26:47.856 --> 00:26:48.982
Boss, your phone.

00:26:51.359 --> 00:26:52.360
Speak.

00:27:04.122 --> 00:27:07.792
A ninth-grader scammed someone
and got sent to juvenile detention?

00:27:10.170 --> 00:27:11.296
Choi Chang-seok.

00:27:12.047 --> 00:27:13.048
Yes?

00:27:34.653 --> 00:27:35.654
Soo-hyun!

00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:38.281
Soo-hyun.

00:27:39.866 --> 00:27:41.076
Is it all over now?

00:27:41.159 --> 00:27:42.160
I came back safe.

00:27:43.578 --> 00:27:45.080
You must have been worried.

00:27:46.498 --> 00:27:47.499
Soo-hyun.

00:27:49.876 --> 00:27:50.877
You're back.

00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:58.677
This annoying little tumor
has latched on again.

00:27:59.177 --> 00:28:02.263
I never thought of you as annoying.

00:28:04.474 --> 00:28:06.017
The interrogation
must have worn you out.

00:28:07.018 --> 00:28:08.228
Go inside and rest.

00:28:08.937 --> 00:28:10.689
I got you a separate room.

00:28:11.189 --> 00:28:12.399
The room in the middle.

00:28:16.277 --> 00:28:17.570
Don't you want to know

00:28:19.447 --> 00:28:21.366
what I talked about at the NIS?

00:28:22.242 --> 00:28:25.078
Whatever you said over there

00:28:26.037 --> 00:28:27.539
in a situation like this

00:28:27.997 --> 00:28:29.999
what is it going to change?

00:28:31.251 --> 00:28:33.086
You went and did your part.

00:28:33.837 --> 00:28:34.879
Rest.

00:28:34.963 --> 00:28:36.715
"You did your part"?

00:28:37.757 --> 00:28:38.758
What's that supposed to mean?

00:28:42.595 --> 00:28:43.596
You're hungry, right?

00:28:47.517 --> 00:28:48.893
I haven't come here in so long.

00:28:48.977 --> 00:28:50.520
It brings back old memories.

00:28:51.396 --> 00:28:53.148
And it still tastes the same.

00:28:55.942 --> 00:28:59.571
What did you mean by I did my part?

00:28:59.654 --> 00:29:01.865
The basic principle
of a magician's trick is

00:29:03.032 --> 00:29:04.826
to fool people's eyes.

00:29:05.535 --> 00:29:07.787
The second is to use psychology.

00:29:08.037 --> 00:29:11.916
Even though I knew your scheme
to make perfect fake money

00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.460
and pin me as the distributor

00:29:13.793 --> 00:29:17.338
why do you think I suggested
we make the game even bigger?

00:29:18.715 --> 00:29:19.758
Soo-hyun.

00:29:20.049 --> 00:29:22.886
You pretended you couldn't refuse
and accepted my proposal.

00:29:22.969 --> 00:29:27.766
You went all in
to make perfect counterfeit bills.

00:29:29.768 --> 00:29:33.563
The day the supernotes were finished,
you made the tip-off call.

00:29:33.646 --> 00:29:35.607
Go to the address I give you

00:29:35.690 --> 00:29:37.567
and you'll be able to verify
the counterfeit bills.

00:29:37.901 --> 00:29:39.778
The day 500 billion won was finished

00:29:39.861 --> 00:29:42.155
why do you think I left you behind

00:29:42.697 --> 00:29:44.365
and moved to a new hideout?

00:29:48.077 --> 00:29:49.078
Soo-hyun.

00:29:49.829 --> 00:29:50.914
Stay here.

00:29:50.997 --> 00:29:52.373
Even so

00:29:53.041 --> 00:29:54.709
how did you predict

00:29:55.001 --> 00:29:57.128
I'd team up with Ki-tae
and walk into the NIS?

00:29:57.212 --> 00:29:59.255
It wasn't a prediction.
It was an analysis.

00:30:00.089 --> 00:30:03.051
Watching you look for an opening
till the very end

00:30:03.676 --> 00:30:04.677
I analyzed you.

00:30:05.261 --> 00:30:08.681
"If I give Soo-hyun a chance

00:30:09.432 --> 00:30:11.017
she'll make a reckless move."

00:30:12.185 --> 00:30:14.771
He asked her to manufacture

00:30:14.854 --> 00:30:16.815
some kind of chemical agent

00:30:17.190 --> 00:30:19.108
for Plan B.

00:30:20.819 --> 00:30:22.529
Now I get what you mean.

00:30:23.029 --> 00:30:26.407
I ended up disrupting
the NIS investigation myself.

00:30:26.491 --> 00:30:28.117
That's how deception works.

00:30:28.868 --> 00:30:30.662
The moment you go "Ah"

00:30:30.745 --> 00:30:32.372
is the moment I go "Oh."

00:30:35.792 --> 00:30:37.919
Then you don't need me anymore.

00:30:38.378 --> 00:30:40.088
Why did you get me out of the NIS?

00:30:40.171 --> 00:30:41.631
Why wouldn't I need you?

00:30:42.090 --> 00:30:43.383
I'm going to use you

00:30:43.925 --> 00:30:46.261
to push Cha Ki-tae into action.

00:30:46.344 --> 00:30:48.888
You want me to act as a double agent?

00:30:48.972 --> 00:30:50.098
I'm going to make

00:30:50.932 --> 00:30:53.309
Ki-tae chase Joong-hyuk.

00:30:54.060 --> 00:30:55.603
While that's happening

00:30:55.687 --> 00:31:00.275
we intercept his 500 billion won
right in the middle.

00:31:06.406 --> 00:31:10.618
A magician uses psychology
to pull a trick

00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:12.662
and a con works the same way.

00:31:13.329 --> 00:31:15.039
Would you like to team up with me

00:31:15.999 --> 00:31:19.919
and pull off a magic-trick con?

00:31:24.632 --> 00:31:28.219
You're not stalling
and plotting to backstab me again

00:31:28.303 --> 00:31:29.762
are you?

00:31:30.889 --> 00:31:32.724
The one who trusted you first...

00:31:34.809 --> 00:31:36.019
was me.

00:31:44.694 --> 00:31:45.695
Fine.

00:31:47.363 --> 00:31:48.615
I also need to see the end.

00:31:49.365 --> 00:31:51.576
I built it, set the table

00:31:52.201 --> 00:31:55.371
and did everything
for the whole supernote project.

00:31:58.082 --> 00:31:59.334
Let's reclaim 500 billion won.

00:31:59.709 --> 00:32:00.710
Good.

00:32:01.961 --> 00:32:03.546
I'll trust you one more time.

00:32:05.048 --> 00:32:06.049
Soo-hyun.

00:32:07.592 --> 00:32:10.511
It's a world where real becomes fake
and fake becomes real.

00:32:10.762 --> 00:32:11.888
And we're going to

00:32:13.348 --> 00:32:14.349
take advantage of that.

00:32:15.433 --> 00:32:17.310
"A world where real becomes fake

00:32:17.393 --> 00:32:19.062
and fake becomes real"?

00:32:23.566 --> 00:32:25.276
There's such an organization
in this country?

00:32:29.989 --> 00:32:32.450
I only recently learned

00:32:33.076 --> 00:32:34.494
what you've been going through.

00:32:35.244 --> 00:32:36.955
Depending on the results

00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:41.209
that hardship could turn
into the one big shot of your life.

00:32:42.001 --> 00:32:45.129
Well, I'm just glad that you let me

00:32:45.630 --> 00:32:47.423
keep the investigation rights.

00:32:48.174 --> 00:32:49.384
It gives me a chance to catch them.

00:32:50.593 --> 00:32:51.678
Good.

00:32:52.136 --> 00:32:56.099
With that grit,
make sure you deal with Joong-hyuk.

00:32:57.475 --> 00:32:58.977
There will be a reward.

00:32:59.936 --> 00:33:03.272
Intel says J has the flash drive,
not Joong-hyuk.

00:33:03.898 --> 00:33:04.983
What?

00:33:05.066 --> 00:33:07.860
That means Joong-hyuk ran
with only the 500 billion won.

00:33:12.365 --> 00:33:13.992
Joong-hyuk or J

00:33:15.451 --> 00:33:19.122
it doesn't matter who took
the flash drive now.

00:33:21.082 --> 00:33:23.292
Whoever has it

00:33:24.252 --> 00:33:25.962
he needs to be

00:33:26.337 --> 00:33:29.549
sealed away with it forever
and never come back into the world.

00:33:32.385 --> 00:33:33.386
Then

00:33:34.554 --> 00:33:35.555
you want J to...

00:33:37.765 --> 00:33:40.059
A national agency for the people?

00:33:43.896 --> 00:33:47.567
A national agency is
literally an agency for the nation.

00:33:47.817 --> 00:33:48.818
Wouldn't you agree?

00:33:49.610 --> 00:33:50.611
Team Leader

00:33:51.612 --> 00:33:52.697
Cha Ki-tae?

00:33:55.491 --> 00:33:56.868
No.

00:33:57.452 --> 00:34:00.663
I should make you
an assistant director, at least.

00:34:08.171 --> 00:34:09.380
So

00:34:10.381 --> 00:34:13.593
he's transporting the 500 billion
by waterway, not roads?

00:34:14.218 --> 00:34:15.219
Yes.

00:34:19.807 --> 00:34:21.267
By the way

00:34:22.643 --> 00:34:24.395
about the text I sent

00:34:25.313 --> 00:34:27.732
Joong-hyuk snatched my phone
after seeing it

00:34:28.483 --> 00:34:29.692
then he just let it slide.

00:34:32.070 --> 00:34:33.946
Maybe he missed it.

00:34:34.030 --> 00:34:35.531
But it also feels like he didn't.

00:34:45.500 --> 00:34:46.501
Dr. Choi.

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.545
We've known each other
for five years now.

00:34:50.588 --> 00:34:52.465
Why do you always wear
those same glasses?

00:34:57.553 --> 00:34:58.638
Boss.

00:34:58.721 --> 00:35:01.641
If you suspect Dr. Choi,
why did you let her go out?

00:35:05.520 --> 00:35:08.481
We feed false intel,
send J to the Mujoo Dock

00:35:08.981 --> 00:35:11.067
while we take the road

00:35:12.151 --> 00:35:14.195
to Incheon Port container terminal.

00:35:14.654 --> 00:35:19.784
You take the 500 billion
and wait at the Mujoo Dock.

00:35:20.660 --> 00:35:22.036
I'll be there
after I handle something.

00:35:36.050 --> 00:35:37.969
My revenge was

00:35:38.052 --> 00:35:40.930
to ruin his life
by tying him to the supernote case.

00:35:41.180 --> 00:35:43.850
No matter how it ends,
you get what you want, don't you?

00:35:45.143 --> 00:35:47.145
I've been thinking about it
since yesterday.

00:35:47.395 --> 00:35:48.604
About J, I mean.

00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:52.150
The way he bit our bait
without hesitation

00:35:52.233 --> 00:35:54.986
and the reason he targeted
KC Bank's 500 billion won.

00:35:55.653 --> 00:35:57.905
What if it was all
for the flash drive?

00:35:58.322 --> 00:35:59.365
That makes no sense.

00:35:59.699 --> 00:36:01.868
He was just trying to get
out of here with the 500 billion.

00:36:01.951 --> 00:36:04.162
He only stole the flash drive
for personal protection.

00:36:04.245 --> 00:36:08.332
Once he leaks the flash drive,
he'll become a target.

00:36:08.416 --> 00:36:11.002
Printing it out
and sending it to the NIS Director?

00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:13.713
That doesn't exactly sound like J.

00:36:13.796 --> 00:36:14.839
Okay, then.

00:36:14.922 --> 00:36:17.508
If J is such a cautious type
who moves with multiple plans

00:36:17.592 --> 00:36:20.178
why doesn't he see
he's risking himself?

00:36:20.553 --> 00:36:23.222
He's good at playing on
people's psychology.

00:36:23.556 --> 00:36:24.599
Obviously. He's a con man.

00:36:27.018 --> 00:36:28.978
Let's not see him as a con man

00:36:29.312 --> 00:36:31.314
but as a magician.

00:36:32.190 --> 00:36:34.734
People who are obsessed
with what happened five years ago.

00:36:34.817 --> 00:36:36.611
Let's do it right, one last time

00:36:37.236 --> 00:36:38.279
with supernotes.

00:36:39.113 --> 00:36:41.949
The magician used their obsession

00:36:42.033 --> 00:36:44.493
to recreate the exact same situation
as five years ago.

00:36:45.912 --> 00:36:50.208
They fell under the hypnosis
of obsession and desire

00:36:50.833 --> 00:36:52.418
and moved exactly as commanded.

00:37:03.221 --> 00:37:05.556
Exploiting the gap

00:37:06.307 --> 00:37:08.351
the magician went ahead
with the show he had devised.

00:37:10.144 --> 00:37:12.271
He manipulated people
with desperate needs

00:37:12.897 --> 00:37:15.149
and used them as pawns

00:37:15.650 --> 00:37:17.026
for his real mission.

00:37:18.694 --> 00:37:19.946
What's the real mission?

00:37:20.738 --> 00:37:22.698
Exposing the Eul Society
for what it really is.

00:37:22.782 --> 00:37:25.785
I suspect you're at the heart of it.

00:37:26.118 --> 00:37:27.245
Five years ago

00:37:27.328 --> 00:37:30.498
because of the Eul Society,
you got unfairly exiled.

00:37:31.249 --> 00:37:32.792
And J designed the supernote case

00:37:32.875 --> 00:37:35.962
to play out like
it did five years ago.

00:37:36.712 --> 00:37:38.130
If you don't take this chance

00:37:38.214 --> 00:37:41.259
you will never be reinstated.

00:37:42.093 --> 00:37:43.302
With your temperament

00:37:43.386 --> 00:37:45.388
would you really just sit and watch?

00:37:45.471 --> 00:37:48.975
Wouldn't you want to go all-in,
betting your entire life?

00:37:49.058 --> 00:37:50.726
I got pushed out unfairly

00:37:50.810 --> 00:37:53.312
and chased the warehouse case
for five whole years.

00:37:53.396 --> 00:37:58.567
If J is using my need for payback
after five long years...

00:37:58.651 --> 00:38:00.319
Looks like the ball is in your court.

00:38:00.987 --> 00:38:03.030
Will you let yourself be used

00:38:03.114 --> 00:38:04.699
or will you use him?

00:38:06.325 --> 00:38:08.869
We teamed up for your revenge,
while I wanted to reclaim my honor.

00:38:09.495 --> 00:38:10.579
What's your next move?

00:38:11.372 --> 00:38:13.499
I get what you're saying.

00:38:15.334 --> 00:38:17.420
Just pass the information
without exposing J's movements.

00:38:17.503 --> 00:38:18.504
Don't worry.

00:38:19.505 --> 00:38:20.840
After all

00:38:21.590 --> 00:38:23.551
that's why I accepted J's offer.

00:38:34.812 --> 00:38:38.190
If Joong-hyuk
takes the Incheon Bridge

00:38:38.274 --> 00:38:40.026
it's about 17 minutes

00:38:40.693 --> 00:38:41.819
to the Mujoo Dock.

00:38:46.741 --> 00:38:48.659
If he takes
the Yeongjong Grand Bridge

00:38:49.410 --> 00:38:50.661
it's about 12 minutes.

00:38:50.745 --> 00:38:52.246
JANG JOONG-HYUK'S EXPECTED ROUTE

00:39:21.275 --> 00:39:22.276
What's going on?

00:39:29.075 --> 00:39:30.659
There you go.

00:40:59.707 --> 00:41:04.837
Yeon, you know the taxi J uses
when he's disguised as a taxi driver.

00:41:05.296 --> 00:41:06.589
Do you know what car it is?

00:41:06.672 --> 00:41:08.549
It's a modified smartcar.

00:41:08.632 --> 00:41:09.842
A smartcar?

00:41:10.885 --> 00:41:14.221
It means you can control
its basic functions with a phone.

00:41:22.563 --> 00:41:24.857
We're done packing. Please confirm.

00:41:37.953 --> 00:41:39.288
DR. CHOI
HEADING TO THE DOCK AT 7 A.M

00:41:49.006 --> 00:41:52.635
Joong-hyuk is heading
to the Mujoo Dock at 7 a.m.

00:41:53.093 --> 00:41:54.345
Call Ki-tae.

00:41:55.471 --> 00:41:56.889
Where is everyone?

00:41:57.139 --> 00:41:58.766
They had a job to do,
so they left first.

00:42:01.519 --> 00:42:02.520
We don't have time.

00:42:02.603 --> 00:42:04.146
Call Ki-tae now.

00:42:10.361 --> 00:42:11.487
Soo-hyun and Yeon.

00:42:12.279 --> 00:42:13.781
You're out of this operation.

00:42:18.202 --> 00:42:20.329
Is this why you wanted to team up?

00:42:24.041 --> 00:42:27.461
You accepted my offer,
intending to lock me up too.

00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:34.093
Call Ki-tae now.

00:42:34.176 --> 00:42:35.177
Call him.

00:42:39.848 --> 00:42:41.141
Oh, my.

00:42:41.559 --> 00:42:43.310
It's nice to see you.

00:43:01.787 --> 00:43:03.956
We're ready to go, sir!

00:43:20.139 --> 00:43:21.557
I hacked the system.

00:43:22.683 --> 00:43:23.767
It's open.

00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:34.111
You contacted Mr. Cha, right?

00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:35.821
No.

00:43:35.904 --> 00:43:38.532
You want to go alone
to a place that dangerous?

00:43:39.199 --> 00:43:40.409
I'll handle it myself.

00:43:51.712 --> 00:43:54.465
SEAWEED

00:43:54.882 --> 00:43:56.300
It smells savory.

00:43:56.550 --> 00:43:57.551
Let's go.

00:43:58.093 --> 00:43:59.094
Yes, sir.

00:43:59.762 --> 00:44:00.763
Let's move!

00:44:46.350 --> 00:44:48.852
This is our chance to catch both J
and Joong-hyuk together.

00:44:49.395 --> 00:44:51.313
They're no pushovers, so stay sharp.

00:44:51.397 --> 00:44:52.398
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:38.003
