WEBVTT

00:01:35.959 --> 00:01:36.760
What are you doing?

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:38.439
I know.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:41.560
You're not that simple.

00:01:44.079 --> 00:01:46.120
It's not that simple between you and that Jap.

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:48.879
There's something going on between you two.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.760
You coming onto the island at this time...

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:55.200
...must be because...

00:01:56.519 --> 00:01:57.159
...you're getting married.

00:01:57.879 --> 00:01:58.359
Am I right?

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.480
Are you getting married?

00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:00.400
Did I guess right?

00:02:01.079 --> 00:02:02.120
Why are you pointing at me?

00:02:02.359 --> 00:02:03.280
Believe it or not...

00:02:03.599 --> 00:02:04.719
You wouldn't dare point at me when we were kids.

00:02:04.719 --> 00:02:05.480
What are you pointing at now?

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:08.199
You're actually hitting me?

00:02:08.479 --> 00:02:09.919
You've been gone a few years...

00:02:10.439 --> 00:02:10.919
...and I'm not done with you!

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:12.080
You've got some strength.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:14.400
Nanny.

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:15.960
What are you two fussing about here?

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.360
Your sister just came home...

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:18.639
...and you're bullying her?

00:02:19.319 --> 00:02:20.520
Look, she's the one hitting me.

00:02:21.759 --> 00:02:22.319
Yingying.

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:23.800
Come.

00:02:24.159 --> 00:02:26.360
Come with Nanny to my old house.

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.120
Tonight...

00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:28.360
...we'll stay together.

00:02:29.479 --> 00:02:30.560
Nanny is the best.

00:02:32.560 --> 00:02:33.000
Let's go.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.560
Hitting me, huh?

00:02:38.599 --> 00:02:39.039
I'll beat you up!

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.199
Ye Longxia, you better run!

00:02:42.800 --> 00:02:43.960
Today, at that old man Ye's house...

00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:44.800
...we likely could have found something.

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:47.599
It's a pity I don't know how Commander Fujita...

00:02:47.599 --> 00:02:49.120
...found out about this matter.

00:02:50.439 --> 00:02:52.039
Sending Adjutant Sakamoto...

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.319
...to come and stop my operation.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.919
That Ye daughter is truly arrogant.

00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.400
Could it be the Commander gave the order...

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:10.800
...because of that woman?

00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:13.560
So that's it.

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.840
No matter how I look at that woman...

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.360
...she doesn't look like a dance hostess.

00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:25.080
In my years in the Shanghai Concession...

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.080
...I encountered many dance hostesses.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.800
I can read their eyes at a glance.

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:32.639
When men touch their bodies...

00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:34.000
...they aren't sensitive at all.

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:36.360
This woman has none of those traits.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:39.960
Captain Inoue, you really are an expert in this field.

00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:41.680
This is what I'm good at.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.319
However...

00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:48.080
...I feel she doesn't look like a spy either.

00:03:49.319 --> 00:03:53.199
She lacks the characteristics of a spy.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:57.000
Spies have extremely strong psychological resilience.

00:03:57.719 --> 00:03:58.680
This woman...

00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:00.520
...gets agitated very easily.

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:02.240
She doesn't seem trained in that regard.

00:04:04.680 --> 00:04:05.879
Alright, I'm heading back now.

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:07.680
Dad is still home alone.

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:08.639
Go on back.

00:04:08.639 --> 00:04:10.080
Go keep the Master company.

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:10.599
Okay.

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.960
Comfort him for me.

00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:12.439
I will.

00:04:12.439 --> 00:04:13.639
You two get some rest.

00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:19.680
When you were little...

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.519
...you used to stay here with Nanny often.

00:04:25.959 --> 00:04:26.800
Why is it still...

00:04:29.639 --> 00:04:31.800
...still just like when you were little?

00:04:36.639 --> 00:04:38.000
Nanny wished upon the stars...

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:38.959
...and the moon...

00:04:38.959 --> 00:04:41.319
...and finally wished you back.

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.120
Nanny.

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.000
I missed you so much.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:47.639
Nanny missed you too.

00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.079
It smells so good.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.519
What smell could Nanny have?

00:04:57.519 --> 00:04:59.519
Just laundry and cooking...

00:05:00.839 --> 00:05:02.839
...the smell of smoke and soap.

00:05:03.519 --> 00:05:04.800
It's the smell of home.

00:05:08.519 --> 00:05:09.360
It's so good to be home.

00:05:12.199 --> 00:05:13.519
My good Yingying.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:16.240
Let Nanny ask you something.

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.279
You and that...

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:19.959
...Japanese boy...

00:05:19.959 --> 00:05:21.639
...what is going on?

00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:23.680
Nanny...

00:05:24.879 --> 00:05:26.240
Let's not talk about the Japanese man.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:26.879
Okay?

00:05:27.319 --> 00:05:28.480
Okay.

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:29.399
We won't talk about it.

00:05:29.879 --> 00:05:30.399
Not a word.

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:31.600
Come.

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:39.439
Let Nanny sing you a song, okay?

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.199
Little duckling...

00:05:43.639 --> 00:05:46.680
Quack...

00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:49.160
Yellow little feet...

00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.680
Flat little beak.

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.959
I still think...

00:05:57.480 --> 00:05:58.920
...there is something wrong with this woman.

00:05:59.439 --> 00:06:01.959
Colonel Takeki has probably been...

00:06:02.519 --> 00:06:04.000
...bewitched by this Chinese woman and lost his judgment.

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:05.519
Tonight...

00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:08.519
...I will bring that Tang Ju'er here...

00:06:08.519 --> 00:06:10.240
...and interrogate her thoroughly.

00:06:12.639 --> 00:06:14.040
The Colonel shouldn't be coming, right?

00:06:16.879 --> 00:06:18.279
How could he possibly come?

00:06:18.279 --> 00:06:19.879
This is our territory.

00:06:19.879 --> 00:06:21.800
It doesn't matter. Don't worry.

00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:24.600
Reporting, Colonel!

00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:49.079
Colonel, sir.

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.639
That you would visit a second time...

00:06:51.639 --> 00:06:53.160
...is a great honor for me.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.800
I am not happy at all.

00:06:55.959 --> 00:06:57.639
Your Special Police Unit...

00:06:57.639 --> 00:06:59.040
...the first impression you gave me...

00:06:59.639 --> 00:07:00.759
...is of corrupted military discipline...

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.600
...bullying the weak...

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.959
...and humiliating the women on the island.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:11.000
Today was definitely a misunderstanding.

00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.079
A misunderstanding?

00:07:14.759 --> 00:07:16.199
So what I saw this afternoon...

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.560
...was not real?

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:20.480
No.

00:07:21.399 --> 00:07:22.680
Colonel, sir, you saw correctly.

00:07:23.079 --> 00:07:25.240
The local woman you encountered...

00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.120
...is a nurse in our military hospital.

00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:29.120
She often works with Captain Inoue.

00:07:29.879 --> 00:07:31.439
It is common for them to horse around.

00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:34.839
Is that true?

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:36.439
Yes.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.480
Fooling around

00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:44.800
Fooling around

00:07:45.759 --> 00:07:46.680
What are you doing?

00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:47.680
Fooling around

00:07:49.079 --> 00:07:49.720
Fooling around

00:07:50.399 --> 00:07:51.120
Don't be nervous.

00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:54.279
What are you doing?

00:07:54.279 --> 00:07:55.439
Fooling around

00:07:59.120 --> 00:07:59.920
Don't move.

00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:02.240
Colonel.

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.680
Sasaki, did you swear an oath to His Majesty the Emperor?

00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:06.040
Yes.

00:08:06.279 --> 00:08:07.759
What are you going to do?

00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.079
I recall the officer's oath.

00:08:09.399 --> 00:08:10.839
It should be: "I will obey His Majesty the Emperor's..."

00:08:10.839 --> 00:08:11.519
...every decree...

00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:12.879
...and obey...

00:08:12.879 --> 00:08:14.319
...any order from the superior officers...

00:08:14.319 --> 00:08:14.959
...he has appointed for me.

00:08:15.439 --> 00:08:16.240
My recollection is correct, isn't it?

00:08:16.839 --> 00:08:17.959
You are correct, sir.

00:08:17.959 --> 00:08:19.199
What you should answer now is...

00:08:19.199 --> 00:08:19.879
"Yes, sir."

00:08:20.199 --> 00:08:20.800
Yes, sir!

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.800
Wait.

00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.000
I now order you...

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:43.679
...to confine Captain Inoue to the brig.

00:08:44.159 --> 00:08:44.799
Yes, sir!

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.360
Carry it out immediately.

00:08:57.120 --> 00:08:58.440
What is that guy up to?

00:08:58.879 --> 00:09:00.159
Disgusting.

00:09:44.639 --> 00:09:45.639
Behave yourself.

00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000
What do you think you're doing?

00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:49.440
Dad.

00:09:50.279 --> 00:09:51.519
Biying doesn't want to come back.

00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:53.720
She's staying at Nanny's place tonight.

00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:55.279
You should get some rest too.

00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:58.759
We'll fetch her back first thing tomorrow.

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.399
I'll talk to her again.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:02.600
Alright.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:07.840
Didn't you talk to her?

00:10:09.879 --> 00:10:10.399
About what?

00:10:11.919 --> 00:10:12.879
About the Japanese.

00:10:13.639 --> 00:10:14.320
No.

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.279
I can't be bothered to ask her.

00:10:15.759 --> 00:10:17.279
She doesn't even tell you the truth.

00:10:17.279 --> 00:10:18.159
Would she tell me?

00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:22.240
Get some rest.

00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.159
Takeki Ichiro, right?

00:10:44.159 --> 00:10:44.720
Get out of the car.

00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:45.759
I want a word with you.

00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:47.440
I don't know you.

00:10:47.799 --> 00:10:48.600
We have nothing to talk about.

00:10:49.159 --> 00:10:49.639
Move aside.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.120
I am Ye Longxia, the "Tiger Descending the Mountain."

00:11:07.080 --> 00:11:08.080
You're Ye Biying's brother, right?

00:11:09.240 --> 00:11:10.080
What do you want with me?

00:11:10.600 --> 00:11:12.360
I came to warn you.

00:11:12.519 --> 00:11:13.519
Stay away from my sister.

00:11:14.399 --> 00:11:16.000
If I see you going to her again...

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:17.240
...I'll kill you.

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:21.799
It's too late today.

00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:23.279
Not suitable for conversation.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.159
I'll pay you a visit another day.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.240
Go back to sleep.

00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:34.240
Don't you understand what I'm saying?

00:11:37.919 --> 00:11:39.320
Are you deaf or mute?

00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:41.879
Do you believe I'll finish you off right now?

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:43.960
Jerk!

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:47.200
Drop your weapon!

00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:49.159
Drop it!

00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:51.759
Jerk!

00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:05.279
Get lost!

00:13:24.120 --> 00:13:26.000
Left, right, left.

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.480
One, two, three, four!

00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:28.440
Left, right, left.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.039
One, two, three, four!

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:32.440
Left, right, left.

00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:34.559
One, two, three, four!

00:13:34.759 --> 00:13:35.720
Left, right, left.

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:38.320
One, two, three, four!

00:13:38.799 --> 00:13:39.759
Left, right, left.

00:13:39.759 --> 00:13:41.360
One, two, three, four!

00:13:41.480 --> 00:13:42.440
Left, right, left.

00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:44.759
One, two, three, four!

00:13:44.759 --> 00:13:45.720
Left, right, left.

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:48.120
One, two, three, four!

00:13:48.159 --> 00:13:49.120
Left, right, left.

00:13:49.120 --> 00:13:51.360
One, two, three, four!

00:13:51.759 --> 00:13:52.720
Left, right, left.

00:13:52.720 --> 00:13:55.080
One, two, three, four!

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:56.320
Left, right, left.

00:13:56.320 --> 00:13:58.279
One, two, three, four!

00:13:58.279 --> 00:13:59.240
Left, right, left.

00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.240
One, two, three, four!

00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:23.600
Granny.

00:15:02.559 --> 00:15:03.120
Sis.

00:15:05.039 --> 00:15:05.519
Sis.

00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:09.440
Sis.

00:15:21.279 --> 00:15:22.000
Bro.

00:15:23.039 --> 00:15:23.480
Bro.

00:15:24.559 --> 00:15:25.120
Bro.

00:15:38.039 --> 00:15:38.759
Uncle.

00:15:39.559 --> 00:15:40.120
Miss.

00:15:40.279 --> 00:15:41.720
I'm not feeling well today.

00:15:41.720 --> 00:15:42.480
Another day.

00:15:43.559 --> 00:15:44.480
Uncle.

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.080
Auntie Liu.

00:15:54.639 --> 00:15:55.960
Morning. Long time no see.

00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.480
Miss Ye.

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:01.240
What brings you to see me?

00:16:02.799 --> 00:16:04.039
I just haven't been back in a long time.

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.399
Came to say hello to the folks.

00:16:06.320 --> 00:16:07.039
You're sorting rice?

00:16:07.120 --> 00:16:08.000
Let me help you.

00:16:08.559 --> 00:16:09.879
It's nothing important.

00:16:10.279 --> 00:16:11.480
Then you should head back now.

00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:13.200
I'm still busy here.

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:15.919
How is Uncle Liu?

00:16:17.399 --> 00:16:18.279
He's fine.

00:16:19.159 --> 00:16:20.919
He was taken by the Japanese for forced labor.

00:16:22.879 --> 00:16:25.279
Miss, you should really go back now.

00:16:47.159 --> 00:16:47.960
Uncle Wang

00:16:50.679 --> 00:16:51.279
Uncle Wang

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:52.320
Long time no see.

00:16:53.799 --> 00:16:54.879
Isn't this Ying'er?

00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.200
You really came back!

00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:01.600
A girl changes so much as she grows up.

00:17:02.279 --> 00:17:04.640
Much prettier than when you were little.

00:17:05.519 --> 00:17:07.200
Uncle Wang, you look just as spirited as ever.

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.319
Just yesterday I heard

00:17:09.799 --> 00:17:10.960
that the Ye family's young lady had returned.

00:17:11.759 --> 00:17:13.000
We didn't believe it.

00:17:14.039 --> 00:17:17.119
You see, Sanzao Island is surrounded by the Japanese now.

00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:18.960
For years,

00:17:19.559 --> 00:17:21.960
no one can get in or out.

00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:24.440
How were you able to come back?

00:17:26.319 --> 00:17:27.240
I...

00:17:27.599 --> 00:17:29.920
...went through a lot of trouble.

00:17:33.119 --> 00:17:34.359
Uncle Wang has things to do.

00:17:34.359 --> 00:17:35.119
Come visit another day.

00:17:35.640 --> 00:17:36.480
Uncle Wang, wait a moment.

00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:39.039
I heard that a few days ago,

00:17:39.599 --> 00:17:41.079
an airplane fell from the sky.

00:17:41.519 --> 00:17:42.519
Is that true?

00:17:44.519 --> 00:17:46.559
It was an American plane, right?

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:48.759
Yes.

00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.480
That Tang Bingchen

00:17:51.599 --> 00:17:53.079
made a huge fuss about it.

00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:54.480
Who doesn't know?

00:17:55.480 --> 00:17:57.079
He also said

00:17:57.079 --> 00:17:59.079
there's an American

00:17:59.079 --> 00:18:00.359
hiding on the island.

00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.599
What else did he say?

00:18:04.119 --> 00:18:05.160
He also said

00:18:05.720 --> 00:18:07.720
whoever hands over this American,

00:18:08.359 --> 00:18:09.200
the Japanese

00:18:09.720 --> 00:18:11.240
will reward them with fifty catties of rice

00:18:12.279 --> 00:18:13.920
and twenty catties of pork.

00:18:14.839 --> 00:18:15.400
Uncle Wang,

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.240
have you seen this person?

00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:20.359
Ying'er,

00:18:21.079 --> 00:18:21.680
don't mention it.

00:18:21.880 --> 00:18:23.880
Haven't even seen a shadow of this American.

00:18:24.599 --> 00:18:25.559
Even if I saw him,

00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:27.240
I wouldn't trade him for rice.

00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:28.440
Right?

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:32.559
Alright, come visit another day.

00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:34.599
Come visit another day.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.160
Yu Tongtong, is that you?

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:42.839
Yes, yes, yes.

00:18:42.839 --> 00:18:44.240
It's really me.

00:18:44.400 --> 00:18:44.920
It's me.

00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:45.880
How old are you this year?

00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.000
Over thirty.

00:18:48.599 --> 00:18:49.920
Over thirty.

00:18:50.039 --> 00:18:52.240
Yes, yes, this is really me.

00:18:52.240 --> 00:18:52.920
That's right.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:54.359
Anyone else in the family?

00:18:54.359 --> 00:18:54.640
No.

00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:56.079
So fair and fresh.

00:18:56.079 --> 00:18:57.000
Big eyes.

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:57.880
So pretty.

00:18:58.759 --> 00:19:00.279
Why get involved with a Jap?

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:02.559
Dear girl,

00:19:03.079 --> 00:19:05.119
it's not good to deal with Japs.

00:19:05.599 --> 00:19:07.680
They are too inhuman.

00:19:08.319 --> 00:19:09.920
Granny, come back for congee.

00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.799
Remember,

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:12.519
don't deal with Japs.

00:19:12.519 --> 00:19:13.440
The congee is getting cold.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:14.680
Remember.

00:19:58.880 --> 00:19:59.640
Nanny.

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:04.119
Yingying.

00:20:04.559 --> 00:20:06.480
Where did you run off to so early?

00:20:06.920 --> 00:20:07.759
It's been too long since I was back.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.079
Just strolling around the village.

00:20:09.960 --> 00:20:11.039
Are you hungry?

00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:13.240
I'll go make breakfast for the master.

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:14.160
Nanny, wait.

00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:14.759
What is it?

00:20:14.759 --> 00:20:15.240
Sit down.

00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:16.559
I have something to ask you.

00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.200
What is it?

00:20:19.319 --> 00:20:20.079
Recently,

00:20:20.920 --> 00:20:22.240
has someone come here?

00:20:22.519 --> 00:20:23.319
Come here?

00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:26.799
Who came?

00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.400
I'm asking you.

00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.599
How would I know?

00:20:31.279 --> 00:20:31.759
Really, no one.

00:20:32.559 --> 00:20:33.559
Really, no one.

00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.079
Then what is this?

00:20:39.319 --> 00:20:39.680
This...

00:20:40.319 --> 00:20:41.839
...is a needle.

00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.279
Haven't seen it.

00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:47.079
Haven't seen it.

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:48.559
Alright.

00:20:48.559 --> 00:20:49.319
Then it's nothing.

00:20:49.839 --> 00:20:50.440
Ying'er.

00:20:52.559 --> 00:20:53.200
Brother.

00:20:53.799 --> 00:20:54.440
You're here.

00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:56.160
Dad sent me to bring you both back.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:58.519
I'll go make breakfast for the master.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:01.640
Then let's go.

00:21:02.279 --> 00:21:02.759
Ying'er.

00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:07.240
That colonel who came with you,

00:21:07.799 --> 00:21:09.079
are you sure he's a Japanese officer?

00:21:09.559 --> 00:21:10.759
You called him 'colonel'.

00:21:10.759 --> 00:21:12.000
What else would he be if not a Japanese officer?

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.480
What's wrong?

00:21:16.759 --> 00:21:17.759
Nothing, nothing, nothing.

00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:18.839
Really, nothing's wrong.

00:21:19.079 --> 00:21:19.640
Nothing.

00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:25.519
Brother.

00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:26.799
Brother.

00:21:28.240 --> 00:21:29.839
Brother, why are you walking so fast?

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:30.519
Hey.

00:21:31.759 --> 00:21:32.920
I'm calling you.

00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:34.079
What's wrong with you?

00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:36.519
Nothing's wrong.

00:21:36.519 --> 00:21:37.160
I'm fine.

00:21:38.039 --> 00:21:38.599
Nothing.

00:21:39.200 --> 00:21:40.079
Really, nothing.

00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:42.039
Saying 'nothing' means something *is* wrong.

00:21:43.359 --> 00:21:44.000
Let's go.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:44.759
Dad is waiting.

00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:49.039
Dad isn't angry with me anymore?

00:21:49.359 --> 00:21:50.240
Why did he call me back?

00:21:51.279 --> 00:21:52.039
I don't know either.

00:21:52.559 --> 00:21:53.160
Don't ask.

00:21:53.160 --> 00:21:54.200
You'll know when we get there.

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:56.279
Hey.

00:21:58.279 --> 00:21:59.039
Listen to me.

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.880
No matter what happens at home,

00:22:02.359 --> 00:22:03.680
you must let me know immediately.

00:22:04.559 --> 00:22:05.519
Don't hide anything from me.

00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:08.640
What are you talking about?

00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:09.680
What hiding?

00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:10.960
What could possibly be hidden from you?

00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:12.119
Did you hear me?

00:22:12.440 --> 00:22:13.039
Alright, alright, alright.

00:22:13.319 --> 00:22:13.720
Let's go.

00:22:17.160 --> 00:22:17.960
Yingying.

00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:19.200
Let's go.

00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:20.799
The master is waiting for you.

00:22:23.119 --> 00:22:24.200
How strange.

00:22:35.319 --> 00:22:37.200
Biying, stop making noise.

00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:38.880
I'll go prepare some food.

00:22:41.039 --> 00:22:42.759
Put in a good word for me, brother.

00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:44.559
Dad, we're back.

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:47.599
Dad.

00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.160
Follow me.

00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.039
Is this the place?

00:23:26.039 --> 00:23:26.920
This is it.

00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:32.079
Where is the hidden sentry's bunk?

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.160
Here.

00:23:35.599 --> 00:23:36.319
Is this it?

00:23:36.759 --> 00:23:37.240
Yes.

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.440
Last night when this sentry was changing shifts,

00:23:41.839 --> 00:23:42.960
he wasn't at his post.

00:23:43.720 --> 00:23:44.759
We thought he came back early,

00:23:44.759 --> 00:23:45.599
so we didn't pay it any mind.

00:23:46.000 --> 00:23:47.759
We only discovered he was missing this morning.

00:24:07.319 --> 00:24:08.200
Is this the man?

00:24:09.079 --> 00:24:09.680
Yes.

00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.920
What time did he start his shift?

00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:15.440
He changed shifts at nine-thirty last night.

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:16.759
The guard change was at eleven-thirty.

00:24:17.039 --> 00:24:19.119
Did anyone notice anything unusual?

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:21.079
No.

00:24:25.559 --> 00:24:26.680
Send men to find him immediately.

00:24:26.680 --> 00:24:27.920
The list of personnel

00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:29.160
who returned to the barracks after nine-thirty last night.

00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:30.079
Yes, sir.

00:24:31.839 --> 00:24:32.960
Where is the sentry post?

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:34.079
Take me to see it.

00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:35.640
This way.

00:24:41.119 --> 00:24:41.599
Captain.

00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:44.480
From the position of that guard post up there,

00:24:44.519 --> 00:24:47.759
down to this position here,

00:24:47.759 --> 00:24:49.160
extending all the way over there.

00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:50.359
All of this area

00:24:50.359 --> 00:24:52.680
is within our hidden sentry perimeter.

00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:01.559
Captain.

00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:04.000
This is

00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.680
the list of personnel who returned

00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:07.200
to the barracks after nine-thirty last night.

00:25:08.759 --> 00:25:09.759
Any suspicious individuals?

00:25:14.079 --> 00:25:14.480
This one.

00:25:15.599 --> 00:25:16.559
This is a colonel

00:25:16.559 --> 00:25:17.359
assigned by headquarters yesterday

00:25:17.359 --> 00:25:18.319
to be billeted in the barracks.

00:25:18.319 --> 00:25:20.160
He also returned after nine-thirty.

00:25:21.359 --> 00:25:22.039
A colonel?

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.279
Could it be that newly arrived colonel?

00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:29.160
That's correct.

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:34.880
I know he left the police brigade

00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:37.400
after nine-thirty.

00:25:41.480 --> 00:25:42.960
Listen up, all of you.

00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.559
Conduct a precise search.

00:25:47.559 --> 00:25:49.119
Search inch by inch.

00:25:49.119 --> 00:25:50.799
You must locate the primary crime scene.

00:25:50.799 --> 00:25:52.319
Yes, sir!

00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:36.880
Xia'er.

00:26:37.599 --> 00:26:38.279
Ying'er.

00:26:40.119 --> 00:26:41.200
Both of you, kneel down.

00:26:48.200 --> 00:26:50.599
Kowtow three times to the villagers.

00:27:11.039 --> 00:27:12.240
Father...

00:27:12.720 --> 00:27:13.839
Who...

00:27:15.079 --> 00:27:16.519
are all these people?

00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:19.559
In the twenty-seventh year of the Republic,

00:27:21.559 --> 00:27:23.160
on the twelfth day of the third lunar month.

00:27:25.839 --> 00:27:26.720
That day,

00:27:27.799 --> 00:27:28.680
the weather was fine.

00:27:31.359 --> 00:27:32.799
At seven in the morning.

00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:37.920
Villagers!

00:27:38.319 --> 00:27:39.519
Listen to me!

00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:40.920
Today,

00:27:41.319 --> 00:27:43.119
we will be issuing Good Citizen Certificates.

00:27:43.559 --> 00:27:44.519
Everyone

00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.200
must assemble here.

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:47.839
From now on,

00:27:48.279 --> 00:27:49.359
anyone without a Good Citizen Certificate

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:51.359
will be sent directly to prison.

00:27:53.359 --> 00:27:53.680
Good.

00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:54.799
Now,

00:27:55.359 --> 00:27:56.319
form two lines.

00:27:56.599 --> 00:27:57.759
All of you, form two lines!

00:30:15.079 --> 00:30:20.160
People at birth are naturally good.

00:30:20.559 --> 00:30:26.039
Their natures are similar, their habits become different.

00:30:26.039 --> 00:30:31.640
If negligently taught, their nature will deteriorate.

00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:37.480
The way of teaching lies in concentration.

00:30:37.480 --> 00:30:43.480
Long ago, Mencius's mother chose a neighborhood.

00:30:43.480 --> 00:30:49.759
Her son wouldn't learn, she cut the loom's thread.

00:30:49.759 --> 00:30:55.799
Dou of Yan Mountain had the right method.

00:30:55.799 --> 00:31:01.640
He taught five sons, each achieved fame.

00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:07.319
To raise without teaching is the father's fault.

00:31:07.319 --> 00:31:13.200
To teach without severity is the teacher's laziness.

00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:21.440
Among the thirty-six villages on the island,

00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.279
more than twelve thousand eight hundred people

00:32:24.599 --> 00:32:26.400
were killed or fled.

00:32:28.319 --> 00:32:30.000
In the end, only Tanjia Bay

00:32:30.640 --> 00:32:32.160
and Shangbiao, two villages,

00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:34.880
with over eighteen hundred people, remained.

00:32:38.279 --> 00:32:40.079
What you are kneeling before now

00:32:40.279 --> 00:32:41.599
is a mass grave of ten thousand.

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:45.839
Furthermore, at the west entrance of Yunong Village,

00:32:47.039 --> 00:32:48.359
there is another mass grave of a thousand.

00:32:51.400 --> 00:32:52.720
In every village,

00:32:53.559 --> 00:32:54.680
there are graves of a hundred.

00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:58.799
Why is this?

00:33:01.519 --> 00:33:02.279
For no reason.

00:33:06.359 --> 00:33:07.799
Your father has been to many places.

00:33:09.079 --> 00:33:10.920
Japanese militarists

00:33:11.319 --> 00:33:12.240
are the most

00:33:13.839 --> 00:33:15.240
inhumane soldiers I have ever seen.

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.720
They are simply a pack of beasts.

00:33:22.319 --> 00:33:24.359
In the early spring of the Republic's twenty-seventh year,

00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.000
you left Guangzhou heading north.

00:33:27.759 --> 00:33:28.880
That very year,

00:33:28.880 --> 00:33:30.599
the Japanese occupied Sanzao Island.

00:33:33.039 --> 00:33:33.680
Therefore,

00:33:34.880 --> 00:33:37.119
the family completely lost contact with you.

00:33:38.599 --> 00:33:41.160
You know nothing

00:33:42.119 --> 00:33:42.960
of all that happened here.

00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:46.519
During those years,

00:33:48.279 --> 00:33:49.839
all the residents of the island

00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.000
endured a massacre

00:33:53.079 --> 00:33:54.960
that defied human justice

00:33:56.039 --> 00:33:57.599
and conscience.

00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:06.319
I brought you here

00:34:06.319 --> 00:34:07.279
because I want to tell you:

00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.239
All the villagers on the island

00:34:12.760 --> 00:34:14.559
regard the Japanese as mortal enemies.

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:21.400
You cannot be with that Japanese soldier.

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.320
I could never accept this.

00:34:26.679 --> 00:34:28.480
If you are with that Japanese officer,

00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:30.639
the surviving villagers on the island

00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:33.519
will not accept you either.

00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:53.800
Ying'er.

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:56.159
Weren't you asking me

00:34:56.159 --> 00:34:58.000
how Ke Wen became the way he is now?

00:35:00.280 --> 00:35:03.719
He crawled out from a pile of corpses.

00:35:49.239 --> 00:35:50.360
I should go home.

00:36:01.800 --> 00:36:02.719
When he discovered

00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:03.840
that the entire Caotang Village

00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.440
was left with only him,

00:36:06.840 --> 00:36:07.920
the person he used to be

00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:09.920
could no longer bear to live on.

00:36:13.119 --> 00:36:13.599
Ying'er.

00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:14.920
Listen to your father.

00:36:15.960 --> 00:36:17.840
Stop associating with that Japanese officer.

00:36:53.159 --> 00:36:55.599
A living person just vanished like that.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:58.519
It's simply unbelievable.

00:36:58.519 --> 00:37:01.280
I'll go find a place to sit down first.

00:37:21.679 --> 00:37:22.119
Your Excellency

00:37:23.119 --> 00:37:23.719
Call me Colonel.

00:37:23.719 --> 00:37:24.519
Colonel, Your Excellency.

00:37:24.679 --> 00:37:26.199
I was very rude yesterday.

00:37:29.119 --> 00:37:29.760
Please enjoy your meal.

00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.079
Sasaki.

00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.000
Sit down and have a meal with me.

00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:33.840
Sit.

00:37:36.199 --> 00:37:37.519
Sit down and have a meal with me.

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.480
I'm greatly honored.

00:37:47.840 --> 00:37:48.199
Thank you.

00:37:52.199 --> 00:37:53.199
Captain Inoue.

00:37:53.199 --> 00:37:55.079
Did you sleep in the brig last night?

00:37:55.079 --> 00:37:57.239
Of course. The Colonel's two-day order isn't up yet.

00:37:57.400 --> 00:37:58.519
I dare not leave without permission.

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:05.639
The officers' mess food is quite good.

00:38:05.639 --> 00:38:07.639
Yes, yes.

00:38:14.480 --> 00:38:17.880
The navy's breakfast is always better than the army's.

00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:21.719
And the pilots' breakfast is always better than the officers'.

00:38:21.719 --> 00:38:22.880
An extra egg.

00:38:22.880 --> 00:38:24.039
And a piece of chocolate.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:25.599
You know,

00:38:25.599 --> 00:38:26.599
there are many girls in Tokyo

00:38:26.599 --> 00:38:28.079
who are willing to marry a pilot

00:38:28.079 --> 00:38:29.760
just to get that piece of chocolate.

00:38:29.760 --> 00:38:34.760
The chocolate is sweet, but being a young widow is hard, isn't it?

00:38:40.719 --> 00:38:41.320
Thank you.

00:38:57.599 --> 00:38:58.320
You all eat.

00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:03.760
This is yours, Colonel.

00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:04.280
Please, eat.

00:39:07.599 --> 00:39:08.800
Thank you.

00:39:16.119 --> 00:39:17.599
Go ahead and eat it.

00:39:18.679 --> 00:39:19.880
Thank you.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:29.679
What brings you here for breakfast?

00:39:29.679 --> 00:39:31.239
Doesn't the police battalion have a mess hall?

00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:33.760
Last night,

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.199
a sentry from the garrison went missing.

00:39:35.960 --> 00:39:36.559
An incident like this

00:39:36.559 --> 00:39:37.760
hasn't happened for over a year.

00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.360
We investigated

00:39:39.360 --> 00:39:40.440
the list of all personnel

00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:42.639
who returned to the barracks after 9:30 yesterday.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.880
That list should include me as well.

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:51.400
So you're here to investigate me?

00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:53.360
This has nothing to do with you.

00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:03.280
Based on the preliminary investigation,

00:40:04.280 --> 00:40:08.000
the missing sentry

00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.360
is heavily linked to the Chinese.

00:40:13.599 --> 00:40:14.760
How could such a thing happen?

00:40:14.840 --> 00:40:15.800
Does it happen often?

00:40:16.079 --> 00:40:17.440
Since we landed on the island in Showa 13,

00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.639
nearly forty officers and soldiers

00:40:19.639 --> 00:40:21.440
have gone missing or been killed.

00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.079
The worst incident

00:40:23.079 --> 00:40:24.519
was when they killed twelve of our men.

00:40:25.320 --> 00:40:28.639
It's truly a detestable place.

00:40:29.599 --> 00:40:30.599
Why is it like this?

00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:35.320
Sanzao Island is not far from Macau, China.

00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:37.679
That place can hide anything.

00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:38.760
Macau, China.

00:40:40.159 --> 00:40:40.679
Yes.

00:40:41.039 --> 00:40:43.360
Macau, China is Portuguese territory.

00:40:43.599 --> 00:40:44.840
It's a neutral zone.

00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:45.719
The night before last,

00:40:45.880 --> 00:40:49.440
the gunboat that attacked our transport ship, the *Amemaru*,

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:53.079
was a Chiang regime vessel hiding there.

00:40:53.239 --> 00:40:54.760
There are also gangs and assassins there

00:40:55.039 --> 00:40:56.880
who often come to the island to cause trouble.

00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:01.239
That should be easy then.

00:41:01.239 --> 00:41:02.400
Such a small place.

00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.880
Just send troops to occupy it. Darn it.

00:41:06.639 --> 00:41:07.599
No.

00:41:08.039 --> 00:41:10.000
We can occupy China, the Philippines, Burma,

00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:13.679
Singapore, and Hong Kong, China.

00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:14.719
But we cannot occupy

00:41:14.719 --> 00:41:15.639
Portuguese-affiliated Macau, China.

00:41:16.639 --> 00:41:17.119
Why?

00:41:18.519 --> 00:41:19.239
It's said that Brazil sent a diplomatic note

00:41:19.239 --> 00:41:20.239
to our Foreign Ministry.

00:41:20.239 --> 00:41:21.119
The note stated

00:41:21.119 --> 00:41:22.920
that if we militarily occupy Macau, China,

00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:24.039
Brazil would expel all of our

00:41:24.039 --> 00:41:25.880
Japanese nationals there—over three million people—

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:28.079
and send them back to the Japanese mainland.

00:41:28.679 --> 00:41:29.840
The military headquarters fears

00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.440
that repatriating these three million Japanese

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:35.159
would cause domestic chaos beyond control.

00:41:35.880 --> 00:41:36.119
Therefore,

00:41:36.119 --> 00:41:37.239
they strictly forbid us from provoking that place.

00:41:37.239 --> 00:41:38.679
That's how it is.

00:41:39.440 --> 00:41:40.559
I didn't expect a mere company commander like you

00:41:40.880 --> 00:41:41.840
to know so much.

00:41:43.599 --> 00:41:45.239
This is all from our battalion commander.

00:41:46.039 --> 00:41:46.800
Captain Inoue?

00:41:47.679 --> 00:41:49.320
Yes, it was Captain Inoue.

00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:50.920
Is that correct?

00:41:50.920 --> 00:41:51.440
Yes.

00:41:58.320 --> 00:41:59.239
It seems then

00:41:59.360 --> 00:42:00.840
this island isn't very safe either.

00:42:02.719 --> 00:42:05.920
I think it's best to have Battalion Commander Inoue

00:42:06.119 --> 00:42:07.599
assign two men to you.

00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:10.239
It would be safer that way.

00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:14.480
Do you think someone from the Imperial Household Agency

00:42:14.480 --> 00:42:15.519
can be approached by just any gang thugs?

00:42:15.519 --> 00:42:16.880
Do you think they can get close?

00:42:25.079 --> 00:42:26.000
Finish your meal before you leave.

00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:29.400
Thank you.
