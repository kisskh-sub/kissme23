00:01:37.599 --> 00:01:38.599
This sketch

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.959
This is the courtyard.

00:01:42.359 --> 00:01:45.400
Then this front hall.

00:01:46.719 --> 00:01:47.319
The rear hall.

00:01:49.799 --> 00:01:50.799
The key point is,

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:53.920
we need to build

00:01:53.959 --> 00:01:55.319
a structure in this courtyard,

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.120
a secret basement.

00:01:58.680 --> 00:01:59.599
Right here.

00:02:03.920 --> 00:02:07.239
This officer speaks quite politely.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:08.719
Alright.

00:02:09.199 --> 00:02:10.680
Then I'll take a look for you.

00:02:30.919 --> 00:02:31.240
Hey.

00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:48.080
Ouch.

00:02:48.879 --> 00:02:51.080
Building a house next to the police battalion

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.400
is not the right location.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.919
It's off-center.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:58.599
Off-center.

00:02:58.919 --> 00:03:01.400
Even if you build the house here,

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.159
it would be an improper path.

00:03:04.599 --> 00:03:06.000
In my humble opinion,

00:03:07.199 --> 00:03:08.680
it would be better to place your compound

00:03:09.599 --> 00:03:11.960
behind the battalion headquarters.

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:13.639
You see?

00:03:14.039 --> 00:03:14.960
Good.

00:03:15.599 --> 00:03:17.240
Then, old sir, please see

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.919
if there are any areas not in line with Feng Shui.

00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:21.680
Let me take another look for you.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:28.639
Yes.

00:03:30.199 --> 00:03:31.599
Your underground secret room

00:03:31.599 --> 00:03:33.280
is not suitable here.

00:03:34.159 --> 00:03:35.599
It's neither safe

00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:36.599
nor discreet.

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.039
It needs to be central.

00:03:38.639 --> 00:03:39.319
Central.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:39.719
Oh.

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:41.400
What I mean is,

00:03:41.599 --> 00:03:42.400
placing it

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.319
under the front reception hall

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:45.599
is the safest.

00:03:51.599 --> 00:03:52.840
How do you know?

00:03:53.599 --> 00:03:56.199
Are there such structures on the island?

00:03:56.599 --> 00:03:57.840
Mhm, yes.

00:03:59.039 --> 00:04:00.319
The Ye family's old house.

00:04:00.319 --> 00:04:03.000
Its buildings are quite similar to yours.

00:04:03.719 --> 00:04:05.400
Back when the house was built,

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.280
I was the one who assessed its Feng Shui.

00:04:07.599 --> 00:04:08.319
Mhm.

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:10.520
Their family's secret room...

00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:11.800
Is it also under the reception hall?

00:04:20.759 --> 00:04:23.360
It seems what you said is correct.

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:27.319
Back then,

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:29.199
I did go to see it.

00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:31.319
But it was a long time ago.

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:32.639
This old man is confused.

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.120
I'm afraid I can't remember clearly.

00:04:37.519 --> 00:04:38.240
It's fine.

00:04:40.199 --> 00:04:40.959
Thank you.

00:04:42.519 --> 00:04:43.240
Thank you.

00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:58.720
Captain, you're really resourceful.

00:04:59.319 --> 00:05:01.319
That old man gave in immediately.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.399
Lock this man up.

00:05:05.399 --> 00:05:06.360
Until we uncover

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.279
the secrets of all the secret rooms on the island,

00:05:08.639 --> 00:05:09.319
do not let him go back.

00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:10.600
Yes, sir.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:12.959
We move tomorrow.

00:05:37.319 --> 00:05:37.680
Captain.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.519
What is it?

00:05:38.759 --> 00:05:39.879
There seems to be smoke over there.

00:05:41.519 --> 00:05:42.079
Go check it out.

00:05:42.079 --> 00:05:42.360
Yes, sir.

00:06:02.079 --> 00:06:03.399
Captain.

00:06:03.399 --> 00:06:04.720
Now on this whole island, the only one

00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:07.120
who doesn't hide from us is this guy, right?

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:17.160
What's wrong?

00:06:20.040 --> 00:06:20.839
Give me the cigarette.

00:06:21.639 --> 00:06:22.160
Alright.

00:06:24.399 --> 00:06:27.079
Captain, have you started smoking?

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:29.680
Here.

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:17.920
What are you doing?

00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.920
Don't do anything to him.

00:07:32.199 --> 00:07:33.079
Give me the matches.

00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:33.839
Yes, sir.

00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.240
Give it to me.

00:08:23.319 --> 00:08:24.079
Tell me,

00:08:24.959 --> 00:08:26.199
where did this come from?

00:08:26.199 --> 00:08:27.519
Give it to me.

00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:29.839
Give it to me!

00:08:29.839 --> 00:08:30.600
Where from?

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:34.519
Who gave it to you?

00:08:34.519 --> 00:08:35.240
Give it!

00:08:38.399 --> 00:08:40.320
Are you going to talk or not?

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.159
Where did you pick it up?

00:08:49.879 --> 00:08:50.360
Alright then.

00:08:52.320 --> 00:08:53.279
Let's play a game.

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:54.360
Okay?

00:08:54.919 --> 00:08:55.639
I'll hide it.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:57.519
You find it.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:08:58.600
Mhm.

00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:00.399
Find it one more time,

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:01.799
and I'll give it back to you.

00:09:02.559 --> 00:09:03.399
Turn him around.

00:09:05.759 --> 00:09:08.600
Give it.

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:19.879
Turn around.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:23.879
Come on.

00:09:24.879 --> 00:09:25.559
Find it.

00:09:29.120 --> 00:09:30.120
No.

00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.919
No.

00:09:56.759 --> 00:09:57.360
Turn around.

00:10:03.279 --> 00:10:03.720
Again.

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:08.240
No.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.519
One more time.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:24.399
Come on.

00:10:47.679 --> 00:10:49.399
Give it to me!

00:11:05.480 --> 00:11:06.159
What are you doing?

00:11:07.799 --> 00:11:08.639
Turn him back around.

00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:29.679
He's pretending to be stupid, right?

00:11:31.279 --> 00:11:32.559
How could he

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.279
guess it was in your pocket right away?

00:11:36.279 --> 00:11:39.960
He's faking it, right?

00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:43.399
Can't you see it?

00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:50.039
Could it be he picked it from the American's pocket?

00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:56.720
Inoue.

00:11:56.960 --> 00:11:57.279
Yes, sir.

00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.559
Send someone to secretly watch him.

00:12:00.879 --> 00:12:01.399
I want to see

00:12:02.799 --> 00:12:03.279
besides us,

00:12:03.279 --> 00:12:04.000
who else on this island would

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.360
be interested in an American's lighter.

00:12:06.639 --> 00:12:07.480
Understood.

00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:10.679
Captain.

00:12:16.879 --> 00:12:17.600
What's the situation?

00:12:18.159 --> 00:12:19.200
Reporting, Captain.

00:12:19.279 --> 00:12:20.759
Colonel Takeki went to the Ye house early this morning.

00:12:20.919 --> 00:12:22.000
We've been waiting outside the whole time.

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.039
We didn't dare act rashly.

00:12:24.240 --> 00:12:25.360
That damn old man.

00:12:25.679 --> 00:12:26.879
Thinks that because his daughter

00:12:26.879 --> 00:12:28.559
has latched onto a Japanese officer,

00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.200
he has an umbrella of protection.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:30.919
That we wouldn't dare search him.

00:12:33.039 --> 00:12:33.600
Let's go.

00:12:34.360 --> 00:12:34.840
Yes, sir.

00:12:35.759 --> 00:12:36.799
Let's go.

00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.519
This is a Syrette morphine syringe

00:12:41.519 --> 00:12:44.000
produced by the American company Squibb.

00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:45.840
For exclusive use by the US military.

00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:49.159
I found it at Fourth Granny's house.

00:12:50.759 --> 00:12:51.320
Oh.

00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:13.679
Mr. Ye

00:13:15.919 --> 00:13:17.080
I hope you will tell us everything

00:13:17.799 --> 00:13:19.559
you know about this man.

00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.159
Mr. Takeki

00:13:26.279 --> 00:13:29.799
You really are a terrible negotiator.

00:13:31.759 --> 00:13:33.120
And you are not a good actor either.

00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.480
Playing dumb so completely

00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:37.159
can sometimes give you away.

00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:39.279
Just a few days ago,

00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:41.080
an American military plane

00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:42.279
crashed near Sanzao Island.

00:13:43.080 --> 00:13:44.799
An American pilot parachuted out

00:13:44.799 --> 00:13:45.919
and landed on Sanzao Island.

00:13:46.399 --> 00:13:48.360
This Syrette morphine syringe was on him.

00:13:49.559 --> 00:13:50.919
He was badly injured, wasn't he?

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.639
I've heard about the plane crash,

00:13:58.279 --> 00:13:59.519
but as for whether there was an American...

00:14:02.600 --> 00:14:04.000
Whether there was an American...

00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.840
I'm not so sure.

00:14:06.799 --> 00:14:08.679
You should ask your commander.

00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:10.639
Dad.

00:14:12.159 --> 00:14:14.159
We came back to the island for this.

00:14:21.039 --> 00:14:21.480
Dad!

00:14:22.039 --> 00:14:23.039
Japanese soldiers are in the village again.

00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:24.600
They seem to be heading our way.

00:14:25.519 --> 00:14:26.799
Dad, don't you trust your own daughter?

00:14:27.840 --> 00:14:29.240
Will you just stand by and watch the American

00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.519
get captured by that Japanese man?

00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:32.080
Mr. Ye.

00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:33.919
Even if you don't want to take us to him,

00:14:34.519 --> 00:14:35.600
the police battalion is here now.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.639
They are coming for him.

00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:38.600
If we don't move him in time,

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:39.799
do you want to see him captured?

00:14:40.080 --> 00:14:41.080
Takeki is here to help us.

00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:50.200
Dad.

00:14:50.759 --> 00:14:53.600
Actually, there's something I haven't told you.

00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:56.759
Takeki killed a Japanese soldier for me.

00:15:57.679 --> 00:15:59.679
Ah, what do we do?

00:16:01.279 --> 00:16:03.039
Colonel, what happened?

00:16:03.480 --> 00:16:03.919
Hey.

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:05.240
Battalion Commander Oshima.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:06.559
I was driving along,

00:16:06.559 --> 00:16:07.639
and it suddenly started smoking here.

00:16:07.639 --> 00:16:08.720
So I pulled over here.

00:16:08.919 --> 00:16:10.320
I don't know what's wrong.

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.360
And now it won't start either.

00:16:13.279 --> 00:16:13.600
Come here.

00:16:13.799 --> 00:16:14.480
Fix it for the Colonel.

00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:14.840
Yes, sir.

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:20.279
Hello, Miss Ye.

00:16:22.399 --> 00:16:22.799
Colonel.

00:16:22.799 --> 00:16:23.200
Yes.

00:16:23.879 --> 00:16:25.000
You just came from Ye Degong's house, right?

00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:26.559
Yes.

00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:28.399
I went to Miss Ye's house earlier

00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:29.679
to pick her up for the barracks.

00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:31.759
You brought so many men.

00:16:31.759 --> 00:16:32.559
Do you have a mission to carry out?

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:35.919
I wonder if the tire is flat.

00:16:36.759 --> 00:16:37.840
The tire should be fine, right?

00:16:42.200 --> 00:16:44.000
The tire should be fine.

00:16:44.879 --> 00:16:45.679
Commander.

00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:47.320
Don't waste time with him here.

00:16:47.879 --> 00:16:51.519
Let's hurry and search the Ye family's secret room.

00:16:54.639 --> 00:16:56.240
The smoke seems to be lessening.

00:16:56.559 --> 00:16:57.399
Great.

00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:10.599
What's under this blanket?

00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:12.920
Battalion Commander Oshima.

00:17:13.599 --> 00:17:14.759
If you have a mission,

00:17:14.759 --> 00:17:15.480
please attend to it first.

00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:16.400
I'm fine here.

00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:17.319
I can handle it myself.

00:17:20.359 --> 00:17:21.079
I understand.

00:17:21.319 --> 00:17:21.599
Yes, sir.

00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:22.759
Let us help you push it out.

00:17:23.039 --> 00:17:23.359
Yes.

00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.000
What a bother.

00:17:28.759 --> 00:17:30.000
One, two, one.

00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:32.279
One, two, one.

00:17:33.599 --> 00:17:35.000
One, two, one.

00:17:35.480 --> 00:17:36.640
One, two, one.

00:17:50.319 --> 00:17:51.519
Alright, no problem now.

00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.920
Thank you.

00:17:53.240 --> 00:17:54.039
Thank you.

00:17:54.759 --> 00:17:55.400
You're welcome.

00:17:56.799 --> 00:17:57.359
We'll be going now.

00:17:58.079 --> 00:17:58.599
Let's go.

00:18:04.039 --> 00:18:04.920
Take care.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:51.960
Left face.

00:19:00.759 --> 00:19:01.119
Move out.

00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:11.880
Coming, coming.

00:19:14.039 --> 00:19:15.279
Stay calm.

00:19:15.559 --> 00:19:16.480
Don't act rashly.

00:19:47.119 --> 00:19:48.279
Good morning, Battalion Commander.

00:19:50.119 --> 00:19:51.599
Colonel Takeki is very concerned about you.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.079
He came first thing in the morning.

00:19:56.519 --> 00:19:57.759
He took my daughter to the barracks.

00:19:59.160 --> 00:19:59.680
Oh.

00:20:00.519 --> 00:20:01.240
I see.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:06.039
What are you soldiers doing?

00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.720
We know your house

00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:11.839
has a secret room built in.

00:20:13.119 --> 00:20:13.759
Am I right?

00:20:18.079 --> 00:20:18.400
Yes.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.279
What do you want?

00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:25.200
We are looking for someone.

00:20:26.839 --> 00:20:27.599
Looking for someone?

00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:31.640
My secret room only holds things.

00:20:32.119 --> 00:20:32.960
No one is hidden there.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:34.400
Once it's opened,

00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:35.920
we'll know for sure.

00:20:37.839 --> 00:20:38.279
So,

00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:41.920
will you open it for us,

00:20:42.359 --> 00:20:43.119
or

00:20:44.559 --> 00:20:45.680
shall we smash it open?

00:20:48.279 --> 00:20:48.759
What are you doing?

00:20:48.839 --> 00:20:49.599
What do you think you're doing?

00:20:50.279 --> 00:20:50.799
Don't go in!

00:20:52.079 --> 00:20:53.480
Xia'er, Xia'er!

00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.160
Take them to the secret room.

00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:44.240
Commander.

00:21:44.279 --> 00:21:45.799
There are only things inside, no people.

00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:12.720
What is this?

00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:17.839
Probably their ancestors.

00:22:22.759 --> 00:22:23.279
Sasaki.

00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:24.279
Yes.

00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:27.920
What seems off to you?

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.400
What seems off to you, sir?

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:36.759
A basement

00:22:36.759 --> 00:22:38.839
should smell like a basement.

00:22:39.279 --> 00:22:39.680
The air...

00:22:40.079 --> 00:22:41.839
But here, it doesn't.

00:22:45.720 --> 00:22:46.279
Moreover,

00:22:48.359 --> 00:22:49.680
there's another scent.

00:22:51.039 --> 00:22:51.960
You mean...

00:22:53.519 --> 00:22:54.400
The smell of people.

00:22:57.279 --> 00:22:59.200
Someone has been living here.

00:23:05.680 --> 00:23:06.279
Battalion Commander Oshima

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:07.559
If you have a mission,

00:23:07.559 --> 00:23:08.279
you should go attend to it first.

00:23:08.519 --> 00:23:09.279
I'm fine here.

00:23:09.279 --> 00:23:10.079
I can handle it myself.

00:23:11.839 --> 00:23:12.200
Inoue.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:12.920
Yes.

00:23:13.279 --> 00:23:14.640
You take two men and stay.

00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:15.160
Yes.

00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:16.759
Sasaki, come with me.

00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:17.799
Catch up with Colonel Takeki.

00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.480
Everyone, withdraw.

00:23:21.559 --> 00:23:21.960
Yes.

00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:05.519
Where to?

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:06.799
Back to the barracks first.

00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:08.200
Back to the barracks.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:10.240
He's so badly wounded now.

00:24:10.240 --> 00:24:11.880
We need to find him immediately and treat him.

00:24:13.799 --> 00:24:14.279
Hey.

00:24:15.559 --> 00:24:16.039
What are you doing?

00:24:16.759 --> 00:24:17.160
Hey.

00:24:17.279 --> 00:24:18.079
Where are you going?

00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:19.640
Are you even listening to me?

00:24:25.039 --> 00:24:25.960
What are you doing?

00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:30.079
I said he's seriously wounded.

00:24:30.079 --> 00:24:31.240
He needs immediate treatment.

00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:40.880
What are you doing?

00:24:41.359 --> 00:24:42.480
They should be catching up soon, right?

00:24:43.599 --> 00:24:43.960
Who?

00:24:45.279 --> 00:24:45.920
Our tail.

00:24:50.279 --> 00:24:50.920
Then what are you doing?

00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:51.400
Are we going or not?

00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:52.559
Let's go.

00:24:52.559 --> 00:24:53.119
Are you sure?

00:24:56.079 --> 00:24:56.880
Suit yourself.

00:26:15.079 --> 00:26:15.960
Battalion Commander Oshima.

00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:17.359
Colonel.

00:26:17.480 --> 00:26:18.359
You've come at the right time.

00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:18.799
Come here.

00:26:18.799 --> 00:26:19.240
Help me with something.

00:26:23.039 --> 00:26:23.279
Come here.

00:26:23.279 --> 00:26:23.640
Give me a hand.

00:26:24.839 --> 00:26:25.640
Okay, thanks.

00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.359
A little higher.

00:26:31.599 --> 00:26:32.519
Higher still.

00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.160
Even higher.

00:26:35.279 --> 00:26:35.839
Lower.

00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.359
Put it by that pillar over there and see.

00:26:41.359 --> 00:26:42.559
Forget it, forget it.

00:26:42.559 --> 00:26:43.160
Bring it back and put it here.

00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:43.640
Put it here.

00:26:49.359 --> 00:26:50.519
Good, right here.

00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:00.559
Okay.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:02.559
Don't move, don't move.

00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:23.880
Thank you.

00:27:26.839 --> 00:27:27.720
You came to see me for a reason, right?

00:27:27.799 --> 00:27:28.279
Yes.

00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:29.839
We were heading to the garrison.

00:27:30.279 --> 00:27:30.920
We happened to see you here, Colonel.

00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:31.599
So we came over to say hello.

00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:33.400
Sorry about that.

00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:34.240
We've wasted your time.

00:27:34.240 --> 00:27:35.240
Then you should hurry and get back to work.

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.759
Thank you. I'll take my leave.

00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:38.839
Wait.

00:27:38.839 --> 00:27:39.279
Battalion Commander Oshima.

00:27:39.839 --> 00:27:40.160
For you.

00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:41.480
Thank you.

00:27:53.519 --> 00:27:55.640
Captain, are we looking in the wrong direction?

00:27:56.200 --> 00:27:56.720
Move out.

00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:06.599
Freshwater Supply Investigation Headquarters.

00:28:07.759 --> 00:28:09.480
What exactly is this colonel here for?

00:28:47.759 --> 00:28:49.799
Last night, Oshima from Sanzao Island called.

00:28:49.799 --> 00:28:50.880
He demanded we investigate thoroughly

00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:52.359
all the details about this woman.

00:29:06.119 --> 00:29:07.920
This should be the woman

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:09.400
that colonel took away, right?

00:29:10.480 --> 00:29:12.480
I also think there's something off.

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:14.319
Yes.

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.480
This woman is named Ye Biying.

00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:19.160
The lead provided points to the Cathay Dance Hall.

00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:20.680
She's a taxi dancer.

00:29:24.039 --> 00:29:24.920
Arrange it immediately.

00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:29.519
A secret, comprehensive investigation.

00:29:30.359 --> 00:29:30.759
Yes.

00:29:32.319 --> 00:29:35.160
Find out that woman's occupation, residence,

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.160
her connections and friends in Shanghai,

00:29:37.799 --> 00:29:39.279
her social activities,

00:29:39.759 --> 00:29:41.160
and when she got involved with that envoy

00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.559
from the palace.

00:29:42.920 --> 00:29:45.000
Investigate everything suspicious.

00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:46.319
Yes.

00:29:46.559 --> 00:29:47.920
I will arrange it right away.

00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:48.920
Remember.

00:29:49.920 --> 00:29:51.039
Remember, the investigation must be secret.

00:29:52.119 --> 00:29:54.680
Don't let the Shanghai Garrison's intelligence section get wind of it.

00:29:55.079 --> 00:29:58.240
That colonel has deep ties with the intelligence section.

00:29:59.039 --> 00:30:00.759
Yes, understood.

00:30:39.759 --> 00:30:41.599
Big brother, she's left.

00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:44.799
You follow her.

00:30:44.799 --> 00:30:45.559
Yes.

00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:47.480
Come with me.

00:31:34.599 --> 00:31:35.640
Search carefully.

00:31:35.759 --> 00:31:36.519
Yes.

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:58.359
These are some of the woman's documents.

00:32:04.480 --> 00:32:07.279
This is a medical record from Yongle Hospital.

00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:12.480
This should be a food ration card.

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.400
And also, from over ten days ago,

00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:19.920
a record of buying rice at a rice shop.

00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.400
Photograph it.

00:32:21.559 --> 00:32:22.240
Yes.

00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.079
You go verify this immediately.

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:49.319
Yes.

00:32:58.680 --> 00:32:59.480
Shopkeeper.

00:32:59.480 --> 00:32:59.920
Yes?

00:32:59.920 --> 00:33:00.920
I'd like to ask you something.

00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:01.640
Go ahead.

00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:03.000
Do you know this person?

00:33:07.279 --> 00:33:08.319
No, I don't.

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.200
Haven't seen her.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:13.920
Think carefully.

00:33:13.920 --> 00:33:14.480
This person

00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:16.640
came to your rice shop to buy rice over ten days ago.

00:33:16.640 --> 00:33:17.880
How can you not remember?

00:33:18.039 --> 00:33:20.319
I dare not speak nonsense.

00:33:21.119 --> 00:33:22.759
I might have seen her.

00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:25.400
So many customers come to the shop every day.

00:33:25.839 --> 00:33:27.920
How could I possibly remember them all?

00:33:29.119 --> 00:33:30.680
I really don't remember.

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:31.720
Don't remember.

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:44.400
Any abnormalities?

00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:45.480
No.

00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:46.839
The entire residence.

00:33:46.839 --> 00:33:48.160
Nothing suspicious was found?

00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.640
None either.

00:33:50.599 --> 00:33:52.599
Has it been verified?

00:33:52.920 --> 00:33:55.079
The verification seems off.

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.920
How so?

00:33:57.559 --> 00:33:59.240
The owner of the rice shop across the street said

00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.240
he doesn't remember clearly.

00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.480
He probably didn't recognize this person.

00:34:04.799 --> 00:34:05.920
How did that woman

00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:08.320
get involved with our Colonel from the palace?

00:34:08.320 --> 00:34:10.639
Have you inquired at Number 76?

00:34:12.599 --> 00:34:13.880
Yes, I have.

00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:16.480
Tang Shengming, a councilor of the Shanghai Municipal Government,

00:34:16.480 --> 00:34:18.480
is an old acquaintance of this woman named Ye Biying.

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:20.239
After the Colonel arrived in Shanghai, he seemed to need

00:34:20.239 --> 00:34:21.599
a woman from Zhongshan like her.

00:34:21.599 --> 00:34:23.719
Tang Shengming introduced them.

00:34:23.719 --> 00:34:25.400
This has been confirmed.

00:34:27.159 --> 00:34:28.119
I see.

00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:31.880
Continue surveilling this woman.

00:34:32.519 --> 00:34:35.880
You continue watching the Cathay Dance Hall.

00:34:36.519 --> 00:34:37.320
Yes.

00:34:37.559 --> 00:34:39.719
Find an informant.

00:34:39.719 --> 00:34:41.760
Get a complete picture of this woman's

00:34:41.760 --> 00:34:42.840
activities in Shanghai.

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:44.119
Yes.

00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:00.760
You've worked hard, Battalion Commander.

00:35:05.440 --> 00:35:06.760
Didn't you catch him?

00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:14.639
Didn't you

00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:18.119
chase him to the airport barracks?

00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:22.239
He wasn't at the Colonel's place.

00:35:23.079 --> 00:35:25.840
Damn it.

00:35:27.239 --> 00:35:30.519
We rushed to the Ye family home in Tanjiawan,

00:35:30.519 --> 00:35:32.320
opened up the secret room

00:35:33.679 --> 00:35:35.599
of that old man we always suspected.

00:35:36.159 --> 00:35:37.480
But we didn't find anyone.

00:35:38.199 --> 00:35:39.119
Right.

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:41.280
Everything from the old man's secret room

00:35:41.280 --> 00:35:43.000
I hauled it all back.

00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.119
The Battalion Commander and I

00:35:44.119 --> 00:35:45.320
tracked him to Colonel Takeki's residence.

00:35:45.679 --> 00:35:47.599
But he was busy with something

00:35:48.559 --> 00:35:51.119
completely unrelated to the whole affair.

00:35:52.599 --> 00:35:57.800
Establishing his Freshwater Supply Investigation Headquarters.

00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:00.760
This is very strange.

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:06.480
But not long after he arrived,

00:36:07.199 --> 00:36:09.000
a garrison sentry

00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:10.079
mysteriously disappeared.

00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.119
And the investigation into that Tang Juer,

00:36:12.119 --> 00:36:13.519
he also intervened.

00:36:14.079 --> 00:36:17.079
This man sticks his nose into everything since arriving on the island.

00:36:17.559 --> 00:36:19.880
He even confined me for two days.

00:36:19.880 --> 00:36:20.960
Control your emotions.

00:36:24.360 --> 00:36:25.320
What did you just say?

00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:28.280
Freshwater Supply Investigation Headquarters.

00:36:28.280 --> 00:36:31.760
What kind of strange organization is that?

00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:34.199
Investigating freshwater resources?

00:36:36.159 --> 00:36:37.920
The American isn't in the secret room,

00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:42.159
nor at the Colonel's place.

00:36:42.599 --> 00:36:43.840
Then where could he have gone?

00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:46.760
He couldn't have just vanished into thin air.

00:36:52.119 --> 00:36:53.360
We've always believed

00:36:53.360 --> 00:36:55.480
the woman by his side is suspicious.

00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:57.519
What if

00:36:57.519 --> 00:36:59.480
the problem isn't just that woman?

00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:11.239
This Oshima...

00:37:11.239 --> 00:37:12.719
He's a cunning fox.

00:37:13.719 --> 00:37:15.559
But his cleverness backfired.

00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:17.199
He even bought us time

00:37:17.199 --> 00:37:18.360
to move the Major.

00:37:22.199 --> 00:37:24.360
But you did well.

00:37:25.119 --> 00:37:26.760
Using his suspicious nature

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:28.239
to mislead him.

00:37:29.159 --> 00:37:30.039
Not bad.

00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:33.639
It's rare for you to praise me.

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.360
You weren't bad today either.

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:41.280
You acted quite well.

00:37:41.519 --> 00:37:42.880
Especially the look in your eyes, very convincing.

00:37:43.159 --> 00:37:44.000
Of course.

00:37:46.159 --> 00:37:48.199
Today was a close call.

00:37:48.199 --> 00:37:50.119
But after all this commotion,

00:37:50.119 --> 00:37:51.840
my father should trust you more.

00:37:52.719 --> 00:37:54.559
We'll be able to see the Major soon.

00:38:01.599 --> 00:38:02.880
Mr. Takeki.

00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:05.159
Come in and sit.

00:38:23.719 --> 00:38:24.920
So,

00:38:26.599 --> 00:38:28.519
you were sent by the Nationalist Government.

00:38:31.719 --> 00:38:32.920
I can only say

00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:34.280
we came to Sanzao Island

00:38:34.559 --> 00:38:36.639
solely to get the Major safely off this island.

00:38:37.159 --> 00:38:38.519
As for more details,

00:38:39.360 --> 00:38:41.039
the less you know, the safer you are.

00:38:45.119 --> 00:38:46.480
Thanks to you,

00:38:48.119 --> 00:38:49.239
Mr. Takeki.

00:38:49.599 --> 00:38:51.320
I was too reckless in that matter.

00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:53.159
My father has already reprimanded me.

00:38:53.519 --> 00:38:55.599
There was a misunderstanding between us before.

00:38:55.599 --> 00:38:56.480
I offended you.

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:58.039
I apologize.

00:38:59.199 --> 00:39:00.199
My apologies.

00:39:00.199 --> 00:39:01.639
Ye Longxia, the Mountain Tiger.

00:39:08.559 --> 00:39:09.639
Old Master Ye.

00:39:10.159 --> 00:39:12.199
There's no need to dwell on past events.

00:39:12.199 --> 00:39:13.760
But the urgent matter now

00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:15.719
is that we must see the Major himself as soon as possible.

00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:19.760
Alright.

00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:23.760
Here, Major.

00:39:24.239 --> 00:39:25.039
Have something to eat.

00:39:25.039 --> 00:39:26.199
We need to move.

00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:30.800
Where are you moving me to?

00:39:37.719 --> 00:39:38.960
Hang in there.

00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:45.960
He is currently at

00:39:46.880 --> 00:39:48.480
the back hill of Caotang Village.

00:40:01.599 --> 00:40:02.239
Who is it?

00:40:03.039 --> 00:40:05.000
Captain Oshima is here.

00:40:05.519 --> 00:40:06.639
Let him in.

00:40:20.039 --> 00:40:22.639
Has the missing soldier from the garrison been found?

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.000
Not yet.

00:40:26.519 --> 00:40:30.559
He can't have just vanished without a trace.

00:40:31.280 --> 00:40:33.559
We are currently investigating the case.

00:40:34.760 --> 00:40:36.119
Are there any leads?

00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.239
I had the airport garrison check

00:40:38.239 --> 00:40:39.760
the list of personnel returning to camp the night before last.

00:40:40.079 --> 00:40:42.639
The Colonel was also on the list.

00:40:42.639 --> 00:40:44.360
Are you implying that as soon as the Colonel arrived,

00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.760
he eliminated our garrison's

00:40:45.760 --> 00:40:46.360
secret sentry?

00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:46.800
No.

00:40:47.280 --> 00:40:48.599
That is not what I meant.

00:40:48.599 --> 00:40:50.159
But as a special police officer,

00:40:50.159 --> 00:40:51.920
I do not rule out a certain possibility.

00:40:53.679 --> 00:40:55.800
The Colonel came to the island with the Emperor's orders.

00:40:56.559 --> 00:40:59.599
I suspect his motive and purpose are lacking.

00:41:01.519 --> 00:41:04.320
Do you mean the Freshwater Supply Investigation Headquarters?

00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:06.840
Our Emperor sent a Colonel

00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:10.519
to Sanzao Island just to investigate fresh water?

00:41:14.239 --> 00:41:15.639
Why do you have so many questions?

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.639
Ye Degong's daughter

00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:20.880
left this island four years ago.

00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:23.639
But this time, as the Colonel's assistant,

00:41:23.639 --> 00:41:24.880
she has returned to the island.

00:41:25.679 --> 00:41:27.280
Don't you find that strange?

00:41:27.679 --> 00:41:28.719
What is strange about it?

00:41:30.480 --> 00:41:32.199
When she returned to the island,

00:41:32.199 --> 00:41:33.280
she was carrying a gun.

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:34.320
And then she was caught by us.

00:41:35.000 --> 00:41:36.559
Fukuda discovered this.

00:41:37.079 --> 00:41:38.559
I am aware of this matter too.

00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:40.639
One of our high-ranking officers

00:41:40.639 --> 00:41:42.079
getting a gun for his lover for self-defense.

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.800
There is nothing to be surprised about.

00:41:45.960 --> 00:41:47.360
Is there anything else?

00:41:52.480 --> 00:41:54.000
We are going to see the Major now.

00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:55.800
Watch out for any tails.

00:42:00.760 --> 00:42:01.760
Excellent.

00:42:09.719 --> 00:42:13.079
According to Inoue's investigation results,

00:42:13.079 --> 00:42:14.280
it was found that in this woman's luggage,

00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:15.719
all the clothing and accessories

00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:19.719
were inconsistent with her identity.

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:21.199
Commander,

00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.800
this behavior is just like a spy's.
