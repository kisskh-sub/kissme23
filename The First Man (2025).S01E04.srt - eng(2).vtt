00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:02.570
- I'm sorry
- I'm sorry

00:00:02.640 --> 00:00:05.540
- I'm sorry
- I'm sorry

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:08.610
- I'm sorry to leave you behind
- I'm sorry to leave you behind

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:09.980
You're doing great!

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:12.450
- I'm sorry
- I'm sorry

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:15.590
- I'm sorry
- I'm sorry

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:20.190
- I'm sorry to leave you behind
- I'm sorry to leave you behind

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.630
Tae Pyung! What do you want to be
when you grow up?

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:24.660
A singer!

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:26.300
All right.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:32.140
Manager Hwang, what did you just say?

00:00:32.670 --> 00:00:34.940
Are you saying the papers already reported
I had a daughter?

00:00:35.210 --> 00:00:38.410
Yes. I think someone
at Dream Department Store leaked it.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:41.410
I haven't even found the baby yet,
and it's already out.

00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:46.280
All right.
Let me know if you hear anything else.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:50.220
Darn, this is infuriating.

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.710
- Darn it.
- Did you see?

00:01:09.010 --> 00:01:10.680
- No.
- Darn it.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:12.380
- Hey.
- Gosh.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:13.880
Darn it.

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:15.710
Hey.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:31.530
Darn it.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.030
- Let's go.
- All right.

00:01:36.670 --> 00:01:37.870
Gosh, where is she?

00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:01.530
A car...

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.330
Stop the car!

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:07.430
Stop! Stop the car!

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.870
Stop!

00:02:10.570 --> 00:02:12.570
Thank you. Thank you so much.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:15.240
My babies, we're saved.

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:17.180
Thank you.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:19.110
Thank you!

00:02:26.620 --> 00:02:29.220
Please, hurry. Quick!

00:02:29.220 --> 00:02:30.690
We're being chased.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.160
If they catch us, we're dead!

00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.790
Horrible men are trying to take my babies.

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.260
They're horrible men.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:38.460
Please just drive. Hurry!

00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.830
Please step on it.

00:03:19.270 --> 00:03:21.870
No!

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.910
No!

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.980
Dong Seok, you fool.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:34.350
Where on earth are you?

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:37.490
Are you even alive?

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:41.990
Your daughter was born.
You have a daughter!

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:45.500
Let go! Get off...

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.170
Let go of me!

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.940
Let go of me!

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:54.540
Let go of me! I said, let go, you jerks!

00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:57.280
Chae Hwa Young.

00:03:57.580 --> 00:03:59.510
You're Actress Chae Hwa Young, aren't you?

00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.480
Why did you pretend to be a nurse?
What is all this?

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:06.780
Why are you doing this?
Are you trying to take my baby?

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.450
Why?

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.560
But you were pregnant too.

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:13.290
I saw the news
that you were having Dong Seok's baby.

00:04:13.420 --> 00:04:15.930
Then why are you doing this to me? Why?

00:04:15.930 --> 00:04:17.160
Shut it!

00:04:19.900 --> 00:04:21.530
What do you think you're doing?

00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:23.940
My baby died because of you.

00:04:24.340 --> 00:04:25.570
Because of you!

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:28.940
What did I do?
How is it my fault that your baby died?

00:04:29.270 --> 00:04:30.480
Explain yourself!

00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:37.080
No! Give me back my baby! No!

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.580
Jung Suk Hee, get this straight.

00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:41.220
From now on, this baby is mine.

00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:43.660
I said she's my baby now!

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:46.160
No...

00:04:47.560 --> 00:04:49.330
I'm the one who went through labor
for this baby.

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:52.500
How can she possibly be yours,
Chae Hwa Young?

00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.370
This is insane.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.130
What kind of monster are you?

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.170
Give her to me. She's my baby!

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:00.810
She's my baby!

00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:04.240
- Never. I won't allow it!
- Shut it.

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:08.610
Or I'll take your other baby too.

00:05:09.650 --> 00:05:12.180
No! Give me my baby back!

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.550
Give her back!

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:15.050
You can't do this!

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.320
No...

00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:19.260
No, that's my baby.

00:05:21.130 --> 00:05:22.590
Please give her back.

00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:29.270
Ms. Chae Hwa Young.
I'll do anything you want.

00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.670
Just please, not my babies.

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:33.970
Please give my babies back.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.710
Please don't do this!

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.050
You're a mother
who has carried a child before.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:43.550
To do something this cruel,

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.380
you, of all people, should know better.

00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:48.420
Stop before you do something even worse.

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:50.350
Let's just end this here.

00:05:50.390 --> 00:05:53.160
I didn't see anything.
I didn't hear anything.

00:05:53.890 --> 00:05:55.690
If you just give me back my babies,

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.930
I'll keep my mouth shut forever.

00:05:57.930 --> 00:05:59.400
So please...

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.700
Please give my babies back.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:04.140
Please spare their lives.

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.110
Chae Hwa Young!

00:06:10.610 --> 00:06:12.310
What do you want me to do?

00:06:14.850 --> 00:06:17.680
Like this?
Should I get on my knees and beg?

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:20.850
Just tell me what I have to do.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:24.390
You think I want to be doing this?

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.230
If you had just stayed away
from Dong Seok,

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.760
things wouldn't have gotten so twisted.

00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:32.660
Your very existence is a sin.

00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:03.030
You want to know what you can do?

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.500
You're asking me what you can do?

00:07:06.700 --> 00:07:08.970
Get out of my sight. Just disappear!

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.500
That's the only way!

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.540
Die! Just disappear!

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:15.370
Die!

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.410
- Let go!
- Hwa Young, stop.

00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:19.080
Let me go!

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:20.880
I said, let go!

00:07:21.510 --> 00:07:24.050
My baby wouldn't have died
if it weren't for this wench!

00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:25.850
You want to know what you can do?

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:27.720
Bring my baby back to life!

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:29.420
Just bring my baby back!

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:30.990
Your baby?

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.730
Please just spare my baby.

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:39.460
I don't care if I die. My baby...

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.570
Just please spare my baby.

00:07:53.110 --> 00:07:54.310
Lock them both in the warehouse.

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:56.810
Get rid of them after dark.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:07:59.680
The mother and her daughter.

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:01.620
Both of them.

00:08:04.060 --> 00:08:06.360
Please spare my baby!

00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.690
- Please.
- Lock them in the warehouse!

00:08:09.690 --> 00:08:10.800
What are you waiting for?

00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.400
Please...

00:08:35.320 --> 00:08:36.320
Darn it.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:46.900
Open up!

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:49.230
Open this door, you monsters!

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:52.400
Aren't you afraid of the law?

00:08:53.870 --> 00:08:55.140
Please let us out.

00:08:56.570 --> 00:08:58.440
I'll live like I'm dead, I promise.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:02.510
I didn't see anything.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:04.520
I heard nothing.

00:09:05.720 --> 00:09:07.290
Please...

00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:26.470
Please...

00:09:43.150 --> 00:09:44.160
My baby.

00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.790
There's no way we're dying in here.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:52.400
Just hang on a little longer.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:54.400
Just a little longer.

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:58.700
Guard them well.

00:09:59.070 --> 00:10:01.470
And erase every trace
that we were ever here.

00:10:01.710 --> 00:10:03.040
Yes, sir. Don't you worry.

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:06.210
- Go on ahead, sir.
- Go on ahead, sir.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:12.650
Kang Hyuk.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:16.050
Wouldn't it be safer
if you stayed and finished things up?

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:18.860
You said your baby was sick
and had to go to the hospital.

00:10:19.520 --> 00:10:22.290
Everyone in the country knows who you are.
How could I let you go there alone?

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:26.430
Besides, we have to wait
until dark to deal with them.

00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:30.230
I'll come back and handle everything.
Don't you worry.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:33.040
First, let's get to the hospital.

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.210
My baby...

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:44.320
Mommy will do whatever it takes...

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.520
to make sure you get out of this alive.

00:10:51.120 --> 00:10:52.320
Even if...

00:10:53.220 --> 00:10:55.230
it costs Mommy her life...

00:10:56.590 --> 00:10:57.830
Mommy...

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:00.800
will...

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:04.470
save you.

00:11:07.470 --> 00:11:09.340
Mommy's bracelet...

00:11:10.340 --> 00:11:11.710
will bring you both...

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:15.250
good luck.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:18.280
I love you.

00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.420
Ok Hee.

00:11:49.080 --> 00:11:50.920
Dong Seok.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:54.990
My boy.

00:11:57.490 --> 00:11:59.890
You must still be alive.

00:12:00.020 --> 00:12:02.030
Right, Dong Seok?

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.930
Should I have let him
marry the girl he loved?

00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:13.200
Maybe I should try to find her, even now.

00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:20.580
There's an article saying
Ms. Chae Hwa Young had a daughter.

00:12:21.580 --> 00:12:22.580
I saw it.

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:40.230
Hello.

00:12:41.930 --> 00:12:43.100
- Hi.
- Who is it?

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:46.200
I'm here to see Jung Suk Hee.
The one studying for the bar exam here.

00:12:46.270 --> 00:12:48.170
I'm a friend of Suk Hee's.

00:12:48.170 --> 00:12:49.910
I just wanted to drop this off for her.

00:12:50.510 --> 00:12:51.640
The bar exam?

00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:55.850
You really don't remember
the pretty woman studying for the bar?

00:12:56.150 --> 00:12:59.120
Where on earth did Suk Hee go?

00:13:07.090 --> 00:13:09.390
I don't know about any bar exam
or whatever,

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.360
but the person who rented this place
for a month is already gone.

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.270
- What? She left?
- Yes.

00:13:14.270 --> 00:13:16.330
It looked like she packed and left.

00:13:16.670 --> 00:13:19.200
I guess I just missed her.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:21.270
You don't happen to know where she went?

00:13:21.270 --> 00:13:23.040
How am I supposed to know that?

00:13:24.540 --> 00:13:25.710
Dad.

00:13:26.340 --> 00:13:28.550
We can't see Aunt Suk Hee today?

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:30.250
I guess not, honey.

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:34.020
Maybe she's studying at a nearby temple.

00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:37.320
- Thank you for your time.
- Okay.

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:41.890
Let's go!

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:50.730
Darn it.

00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:56.210
Did I just hear something
from the storage shed?

00:13:57.210 --> 00:13:58.380
Maybe it's a cat.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.200
Pardon? You mean Ms. Jung Suk Hee?

00:14:22.270 --> 00:14:25.440
Was the girl Dong Seok liked
named Jung Suk Hee?

00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:29.540
Yes. I believe she'd even passed
the first round of the bar exam.

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:31.880
What's she up to these days?

00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:34.810
Ever since Vice President Ma Dong Seok
left for the overseas branch,

00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:39.080
- we haven't looked into that, so...
- So you don't know?

00:14:39.220 --> 00:14:40.220
I apologize, sir.

00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:42.990
- Should I find out?
- No, don't bother.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.990
I'm pretty sure they broke up
a long time ago anyway.

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:49.930
Now that Chae Hwa Young
has had his daughter,

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:51.730
what's the point of finding her?

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:54.370
It would only upset Hwa Young.

00:14:56.430 --> 00:14:57.800
For some reason today,

00:14:58.900 --> 00:15:00.140
I can't help but wonder.

00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:06.410
What if I had just given in
and let him have what he wanted...

00:15:07.080 --> 00:15:08.680
with Jung Suk Hee,

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:12.620
the one Dong Seok loved so much?

00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:18.020
No.

00:15:18.790 --> 00:15:19.920
It's a pointless thought.

00:15:21.990 --> 00:15:24.860
Get rid of all the photos
in Dong Seok's room.

00:15:25.460 --> 00:15:27.630
Hwa Young would be upset if she saw them.

00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.020
My baby.

00:15:47.990 --> 00:15:49.820
My sweet, gentle baby.

00:15:50.550 --> 00:15:52.220
Get rid of them after dark.

00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:54.760
The mother and her daughter.

00:15:55.090 --> 00:15:56.160
Both of them.

00:15:57.230 --> 00:15:58.860
It's already getting dark.

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000
My baby.

00:16:01.670 --> 00:16:03.230
I have to save you.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:04.970
But how?

00:16:31.300 --> 00:16:33.430
That woman, Chae Hwa Young,
is tricking the chairman,

00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:35.700
pretending that she gave birth to her.

00:16:36.270 --> 00:16:38.340
It looks like
she's going to raise your sister.

00:16:39.870 --> 00:16:40.970
That's why...

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:43.510
you have to live.

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.110
If you can just stay alive,

00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.480
you'll be able to meet Tok Hee someday,
Ok Hee.

00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:52.350
How can Mommy...

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.450
protect you?

00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:04.190
That's it.

00:17:04.930 --> 00:17:06.630
It's the only way.

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:08.770
My baby.

00:17:10.130 --> 00:17:11.170
Mommy...

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:13.470
will protect you, no matter what.

00:17:35.260 --> 00:17:37.090
Go take care of Jung Suk Hee right now.

00:17:37.760 --> 00:17:40.330
No loose ends. Make it clean, you hear me?

00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:42.030
Got it.

00:17:42.470 --> 00:17:44.300
Give me the baby. Your arms must be sore.

00:18:00.050 --> 00:18:01.250
It's done.

00:18:02.650 --> 00:18:04.460
We're over the first hurdle.

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:07.860
That must've been hard.

00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:10.560
Maybe you should've gotten an IV drip.

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:11.960
Are you crazy?

00:18:12.500 --> 00:18:15.170
Do you want the hospital to announce
that I didn't actually give birth?

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:19.040
- That's not what I meant...
- Enough. I told you, clean up this mess.

00:18:19.370 --> 00:18:22.210
If that sly fox Chairman Ma finds out,

00:18:22.470 --> 00:18:24.410
all our work will be for nothing.

00:18:24.410 --> 00:18:26.210
The whole thing will come crashing down.

00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.480
Right, I get it.

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:31.820
But Chairman Ma will want
a DNA test right away.

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.790
What do you think
I went through all this for?

00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:39.690
- That baby is Dong Seok's daughter.
- Twins, of all things...

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:42.560
That's why the other one
can't be allowed to live.

00:18:43.730 --> 00:18:45.930
And as for Jung Suk Hee,
who knows everything,

00:18:46.430 --> 00:18:47.900
we have to shut her up for good.

00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:53.170
This looks delicious.

00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:58.310
Hey, you kids have one too.
Why won't this break off?

00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.150
You too. Here.

00:19:02.480 --> 00:19:04.250
So? It's good, right?

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:05.680
Yes.

00:19:06.250 --> 00:19:07.820
- But, Dad.
- Yes?

00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:10.050
When are we going to see Aunt Suk Hee?

00:19:10.950 --> 00:19:12.020
I'm not sure.

00:19:12.490 --> 00:19:14.860
Let's stay at this inn tonight.

00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:17.790
Tomorrow, we'll look for her
in a nearby temple or hermitage.

00:19:17.790 --> 00:19:20.000
We have to at least see her before we go.

00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:33.480
When Mommy's in the island's shade

00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:37.180
- So beautiful, my daughters.
- Gathering oysters

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.450
- Ok Hee, Tok Hee.
- from the sea

00:19:39.450 --> 00:19:42.450
This bracelet will bring
you both good luck.

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:46.620
- Baby is left all alone
- Mommy knitted these for you.

00:19:46.690 --> 00:19:48.230
Wear these bracelets...

00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:54.900
- and always be happy.
- And watches the house alone

00:19:55.930 --> 00:20:02.440
The sea sings

00:20:03.010 --> 00:20:07.240
A lullaby

00:20:07.310 --> 00:20:10.250
No! Give me back my baby! No!

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:12.450
- Head resting
- From now on, this baby is mine.

00:20:12.450 --> 00:20:14.420
- On an arm
- I said she's my baby now!

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.990
She's my baby!

00:20:16.990 --> 00:20:21.630
- Baby slowly falls asleep
- Never. I won't allow it!

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:26.230
My baby.

00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:28.200
Live.

00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:30.770
We...

00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:32.700
have to survive and see each other again.

00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.230
You're here, boss.

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:02.400
You cleaned this place up
without a trace, right?

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:04.370
Of course. Don't worry, boss.

00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:07.370
- Where are the other guys?
- They're inside finishing up.

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:10.940
Have you been drinking already?

00:21:16.650 --> 00:21:18.750
- I'm sorry, boss.
- Open the door!

00:21:19.020 --> 00:21:21.590
You jerks! Open the door!

00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:23.620
Aren't you afraid of the skies' judgment?

00:21:23.750 --> 00:21:25.420
You're all scum!

00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:27.260
Open the door!

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:29.060
Open the door right now!

00:21:30.690 --> 00:21:32.600
Open up!

00:21:33.230 --> 00:21:34.770
Open this door right now!

00:21:34.770 --> 00:21:36.030
Open up!

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:38.040
Open up!

00:21:44.570 --> 00:21:45.680
Darn it!

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:48.580
It stings!

00:21:50.750 --> 00:21:52.850
My eyes!

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:54.850
Darn it!

00:22:00.190 --> 00:22:03.060
- Darn it!
- What are you doing? Go after her!

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:06.700
She's carrying a baby,

00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:08.370
so she can't be running fast.

00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:15.870
If we lose her, we're all dead.
Go get her now!

00:22:16.340 --> 00:22:17.740
- Yes, boss.
- Yes, boss.

00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:28.250
- Hey, get out here!
- Everybody out, now!

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:31.250
This way!

00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:33.090
Over here!

00:22:33.790 --> 00:22:34.960
Hurry up and catch her!

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:36.430
Move it!

00:23:13.500 --> 00:23:16.470
If I get caught now,
my Ok Hee will be in danger.

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:18.700
Whatever it takes,
I have to buy more time.

00:23:19.900 --> 00:23:21.000
That's right.

00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.780
As long as you can live,
I'm ready to die right now.

00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.040
My baby. My little one.

00:23:28.450 --> 00:23:30.150
You have to live, no matter what.

00:23:30.650 --> 00:23:31.650
Okay?

00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:42.430
Over there!

00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:34.540
She couldn't have gotten far.

00:24:35.250 --> 00:24:37.550
We can't let her get away.
We must catch her.

00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:38.680
- Yes, boss.
- Yes, boss.

00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:42.990
No. I have to hold on longer.

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:44.620
Please.

00:26:13.810 --> 00:26:14.810
My baby.

00:26:16.210 --> 00:26:17.610
Mommy's so sorry.

00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:21.320
Why don't you just give up, Jung Suk Hee?

00:26:25.220 --> 00:26:28.060
Stay back! You filthy scumbag!

00:26:28.290 --> 00:26:29.590
You monster!

00:26:29.730 --> 00:26:31.360
Do you have no fear of the skies?

00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.160
Jung Suk Hee.

00:26:33.930 --> 00:26:36.400
What do you plan to do with that?

00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:37.770
If you come any closer,

00:26:38.470 --> 00:26:39.570
I'll stab you.

00:26:41.570 --> 00:26:43.110
That's enough.

00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:46.010
Just come with me quietly.

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:10.470
Ok Hee, Tok Hee.

00:27:11.630 --> 00:27:15.070
I'm so sorry you were both born
as my daughters.

00:27:16.170 --> 00:27:19.680
But still, please be happy.

00:27:20.510 --> 00:27:23.180
Live a long and happy life.

00:27:24.110 --> 00:27:26.380
Promise me you'll live a good life.

00:27:53.280 --> 00:27:54.280
(Filming with newborns was conducted...)

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:55.550
(under parental supervision
with safety and rest.)

00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.390
(The First Man)

00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:09.890
What's a baby doing here?

00:28:09.890 --> 00:28:11.190
Where's your mommy?

00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:12.800
This is exactly like mine.

00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.030
Welcome!

00:28:14.030 --> 00:28:16.430
Here's your basil shrimp cream pasta.

00:28:16.630 --> 00:28:20.440
I don't know who Seo Rin takes after,
but she is a ticking time bomb.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.170
I guess your brother isn't much like you.

00:28:22.270 --> 00:28:24.410
He's a good kid with a big heart.

00:28:24.770 --> 00:28:27.540
What? I thought I told you
not to let Mom go out alone!

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:29.510
It looks like a fight's breaking out.

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:34.820
