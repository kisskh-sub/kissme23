WEBVTT

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.720
Major,

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:37.180
we just need to hold on until tomorrow night.

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.800
Why?

00:01:46.880 --> 00:01:48.160
Xia'er's uncle

00:01:48.880 --> 00:01:50.800
will send people to the island tomorrow night.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.479
By then, (Support Admin Watch on
kissasia.cam or kisskh.org)

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:53.680
we can get you off the island.

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:58.600
You've been in contact with the outside world all this time?

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.480
We've been using carrier pigeons to communicate.

00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:02.560
Is it safe?

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:04.560
It's been safe so far.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.320
Who is this uncle of Long Xia?

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.240
He's the leader of Anlan Hall.

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.680
Anlan Hall?

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:16.130
What kind of organization is that?

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:17.120
Anlan Hall

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:18.960
is what we call the Eight Districts Gang.

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:20.360
The Eight Districts Gang

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.920
originally referred to the 7th District

00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.850
and 8th District

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:26.720
of Zhongshan County in the Macao Hometown Association.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.720
The 7th District of Zhongshan County

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.250
is called Sanzao District.

00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.480
The 8th District

00:02:32.079 --> 00:02:33.610
is called Doumen District.

00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:35.560
These two areas

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.720
are practically connected,

00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.840
separated only by a sea trench.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:41.200
That's why people in Macao

00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.060
commonly refer to them as the Eight Districts Gang.

00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:46.780
After the Japanese occupied the island,

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.720
some wealthy islanders fled to Macao.

00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:53.200
But they all gathered at Anlan Hall.

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:54.520
So Anlan Hall

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.730
consists almost entirely of people from Zhongshan.

00:02:57.800 --> 00:02:59.640
So can this leader be trusted?

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:02.540
The leader's name is Ye Zhaogeng.

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:04.400
He's my cousin.

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:07.260
We went to Hawaii together years ago.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:09.520
We have a very deep bond.

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:12.760
After I stepped down as consul in Hawaii,

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:15.120
I handed over everything I established abroad,

00:03:15.120 --> 00:03:16.240
including the Sanzao Association

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.100
and Anlan Hall,

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:18.520
to him to manage.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:21.300
We used to be in close contact.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.040
But after the Japanese came to the island,

00:03:24.040 --> 00:03:26.700
almost all means of communication were cut off.

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:28.329
Carrier pigeons

00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:30.960
are now our only way to communicate.

00:03:31.079 --> 00:03:33.360
So he's very reliable.

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.410
Don't worry.

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:41.329
You didn't know any of this either?

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:42.400
She doesn't know.

00:03:43.079 --> 00:03:44.480
We have a rule in our family.

00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:46.000
This girl

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.400
can't be told about matters of the jianghu.

00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.500
I'm not allowed to know anything.

00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:51.720
Then tell me more about

00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.680
this Anlan Hall.

00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.760
Anlan Hall

00:03:55.079 --> 00:03:57.600
in Macao's Sanzao Island Association

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.640
was actually founded by my father.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.200
They are very united

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.660
but also quite exclusive.

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:03.680
Before,

00:04:03.680 --> 00:04:05.720
they were just based in Macao

00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:07.320
doing business with outsiders.

00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.520
Later, gradually in Macau,

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.320
they became a powerful force.

00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:12.000
Since the Japanese arrived on the island,

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:14.320
they've been massacring the local residents.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:15.640
Many families from District 8

00:04:15.640 --> 00:04:16.880
died in the massacre.

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.160
So Anlan Hall took the lead,

00:04:19.399 --> 00:04:20.920
with Districts 7 and 8 of Macau

00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.480
and even wealthy families worldwide providing funds.

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.720
They organized young people

00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:26.120
to kill Japanese soldiers for revenge.

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:27.400
They specifically target

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:29.260
Japanese heads on Sanzao Island.

00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:34.480
When I first arrived on the island,

00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.720
Sasaki told me

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.360
that gangsters often come

00:04:37.360 --> 00:04:38.800
to the island to cause trouble.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.330
I guess he meant these guys.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.800
But they're not gangsters.

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:43.920
These District 8 guys

00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:45.400
have both money and power in Macau.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:47.330
They have no need to bully the weak.

00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:49.400
So they're different from the Macau thugs,

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:51.000
the actual Macau gangsters.

00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:53.680
My father doesn't allow them to do evil things,

00:04:53.680 --> 00:04:56.200
but they won't stand for being pushed around either.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:58.280
When the Japanese carried out massacres on the island,

00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:00.320
they became enemies with the Japanese there

00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:02.240
and fought back with an eye for an eye.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.280
A few years ago, in their biggest operation,

00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:05.880
they secretly came to the island

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:08.280
and took out 12 Japanese soldiers in one go.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:10.280
I understand.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:12.480
A few days ago,

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:14.640
because the Japanese were searching too strictly,

00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:15.960
my father originally

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.960
wanted them to sneak onto the island

00:05:17.960 --> 00:05:19.600
to evacuate the Major.

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:22.480
This would ease my father's burden.

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.480
Once the Major reaches Macau,

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:25.560
he'll be safe.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:30.090
We need to plan this carefully,

00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:31.520
or it might backfire.

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.280
Ju'er is here.

00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:46.240
Mrs. Si,

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:47.120
is Longxia here?

00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.040
Yes,

00:05:48.159 --> 00:05:50.520
he's discussing something with the master inside.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.080
I'll go call him for you.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.280
Hey.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:57.720
I'll come back later.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:00.240
Ju'er.

00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:02.160
Go check.

00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:02.880
I'll go see.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.320
Who's Si Po?

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.480
It's Ju'er.

00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:11.760
Ju'er?

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:12.600
I asked her to come in,

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.600
but she wouldn't.

00:06:14.040 --> 00:06:15.760
She seemed strange to me.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.010
Her clothes were dirty too.

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:19.360
I'll go check on her.

00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:20.820
Please let my father know.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.720
What's wrong, Ju'er?

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:49.000
It's okay, don't cry.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:53.400
What's wrong? What happened?

00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:55.000
Did someone bully you?

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.160
Why did you come here dressed like this?

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.520
They beat Huihui.

00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.920
It's okay.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:22.800
That Inoue Kamakura

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:25.480
keeps asking me about Ying'er.

00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:28.280
But I don't know what's going on.

00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.560
I only know the Japanese

00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.880
are coming after you.

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.490
You and Ying'er are both in danger now.

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.760
Damn Japanese!

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.040
I won't let them get away with this.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.040
Please don't be like this, I beg you.

00:07:40.159 --> 00:07:40.920
I'm fine.

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.920
I'm really okay, don't be like this.

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.600
Don't go after them.

00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:46.200
They'll kill you.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:49.800
Ju'er.

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.080
I'm fine, I'm fine.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.409
I'm not going anywhere.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:07:58.480
Brother Longxia.

00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.720
Let's leave this place.

00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:05.680
I can't stand staying here another day.

00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:12.800
Ju'er, my father always said

00:08:12.920 --> 00:08:14.960
those who win people's hearts win the world.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.400
The Japanese can't win our hearts.

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.520
They will never take our island.

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.240
We will leave this place someday.

00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:23.040
I promise you.

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.840
I'll take you with me wherever I go.

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:25.720
Okay?

00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:29.840
But not now.

00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:33.460
Let's endure a little longer.

00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:36.360
Ju'er.

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:38.679
No matter what happens,

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.460
I'll stay by your side.

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.260
Xia'er's uncle is very cautious in everything he does.

00:09:01.480 --> 00:09:03.480
He must have planned everything carefully.

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.740
That's why he dared to send people to sneak onto the island.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:07.720
Therefore,

00:09:08.160 --> 00:09:10.520
we absolutely cannot miss this opportunity.

00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:11.480
I agree.

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.680
I also think this is a good opportunity.

00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.120
Mr. Ye,

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:20.800
this operation is outside my planned scope.

00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:22.040
If we don't have

00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:23.560
a clear understanding of the operation details

00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:25.560
and don't develop a thorough plan,

00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:27.480
accidents might happen.

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.340
Then discuss it again with the Major.

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.680
Every extra day we stay

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.800
means one more day of danger.

00:09:38.320 --> 00:09:39.160
But I think

00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:42.010
it's worth taking the risk.

00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:43.840
Alright.

00:09:44.640 --> 00:09:45.960
We'll go see the Major

00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.680
and hear his opinion.

00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.560
I'll take my leave now.

00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:54.560
Alright.

00:09:56.680 --> 00:09:57.940
I'll be out for a while.

00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:27.800
Ju'er.

00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.120
Ju'er.

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:00.480
Are you

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.220
still angry with your father?

00:11:06.960 --> 00:11:09.220
It's that Inoue Kamakura who's inhuman.

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.640
Ju'er, don't worry.

00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:18.040
I've already spoken with Translator Luo.

00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:19.600
He'll find an opportunity

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.600
to speak to Commander Fujita

00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.760
about reporting Inoue.

00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:28.560
I'm getting old

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:30.760
and useless now.

00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:33.480
I need to find a way

00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.740
to find you someone to rely on.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.160
Father.

00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:42.240
Can you please

00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.260
stop being the Japanese mouthpiece?

00:11:46.400 --> 00:11:47.680
Do you know what

00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:49.280
the villagers say about you?

00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.360
I can't even hold

00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.450
my head up in front of Brother Longxia.

00:11:58.560 --> 00:11:59.680
Tell me the truth.

00:12:00.240 --> 00:12:02.200
Are you still thinking about

00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:04.360
that rascal Longxia?

00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:06.090
Did you just go looking for him?

00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:08.920
Yes, I did go to find him.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.400
What's wrong?

00:12:12.400 --> 00:12:14.200
I know what's on your mind.

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:16.480
But look at

00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:18.680
the current situation of our Ye family.

00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.760
You two can never be together.

00:12:26.040 --> 00:12:26.880
Right now,

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.920
this island is under Japanese control.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:31.240
Even our lives

00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:33.400
are in the hands of the Japanese.

00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:34.760
That has nothing to do with me.

00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.200
How can you say that?

00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.770
I've made up my mind.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:43.800
I want to match you with Translator Luo.

00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.400
I think this young man is quite good,

00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:47.600
handsome and talented.

00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.480
Besides,

00:12:48.480 --> 00:12:51.400
he's in Commander Fujita's good graces,

00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:53.360
and even the Japanese respect him.

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:54.960
You should give up that idea.

00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.920
You're already a traitor.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:04.560
Do you expect me to marry another traitor?

00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.960
Say that again.

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:11.120
You are already a traitor.

00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.240
Do you expect me

00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.560
to marry another traitor?

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:14.240
I...

00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:16.680
Go ahead, beat me to death.

00:13:17.360 --> 00:13:19.360
I don't want to live anyway.

00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:28.240
Your father's good intentions,

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:32.360
why can't you understand them?

00:13:42.560 --> 00:13:44.920
I'll go make some food. You must be hungry.

00:13:44.920 --> 00:13:46.800
You've been through a lot.

00:13:56.080 --> 00:13:57.800
Ōshima Hiroshi has sealed off the village.

00:13:57.800 --> 00:13:58.840
His purpose is to

00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:01.040
separate the villagers from the Major.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.800
No matter where the Major hides,

00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.640
as long as he remains here,

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:04.800
he's not safe.

00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:08.480
I still think he should go to Macau as soon as possible.

00:14:12.480 --> 00:14:14.360
Let's discuss it after we see him.

00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.160
Great!

00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.840
Finally I can leave this hellhole.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:14:59.880
These past few days here,

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.360
I've been like a rat in a trap.

00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.330
When are we leaving?

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:07.920
I disagree.

00:15:12.880 --> 00:15:14.740
I think this is a good opportunity

00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:16.420
that we shouldn't pass up.

00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.060
If they could sneak in safely,

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:21.320
we should be able to get out safely too.

00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:21.760
Yes.

00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:24.040
My brother said that from Macau,

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:24.760
they've secretly landed on the island

00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:25.560
several times,

00:15:25.560 --> 00:15:26.800
even killed Japanese soldiers,

00:15:26.800 --> 00:15:27.960
and never failed.

00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:34.600
If we move the Major to Macau

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:36.080
and then transport him out from there,

00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:38.080
wouldn't that be relatively safer?

00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:42.380
If you don't want to leave,

00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:45.000
I'll go by myself.

00:15:49.760 --> 00:15:50.840
Can you even stand up?

00:15:50.840 --> 00:15:52.160
Can you change your clothes?

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:53.490
Can you walk out of here?

00:15:54.280 --> 00:15:55.080
Fine, if you can leave,

00:15:55.080 --> 00:15:55.960
my mission is accomplished.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:15:56.960
Go ahead.

00:15:57.520 --> 00:15:58.720
Mr. Wumu,

00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:01.400
if you disagree,

00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:03.890
you should at least tell me why.

00:16:04.360 --> 00:16:05.720
A safe evacuation route

00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.160
requires a complete plan and detailed information.

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.920
There's only one such route.

00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:13.060
Not enough.

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.680
On the way here,

00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:15.960
the police squad has already blocked

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:17.320
all entrances to the village

00:16:17.320 --> 00:16:18.280
to isolate him

00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.360
and the villagers,

00:16:19.360 --> 00:16:20.240
forcing him to come out.

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:21.280
If we try to leave now,

00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:22.520
we'd be walking right into their trap.

00:16:22.520 --> 00:16:23.360
Well done,

00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.360
Major.

00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:25.960
That's all

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:27.580
I can reveal to you.

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:32.960
Precisely because the Japanese have taken action,

00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.800
this opportunity is even more precious.

00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:36.040
If we don't leave,

00:16:36.720 --> 00:16:37.520
it won't be long

00:16:37.520 --> 00:16:39.160
before the Japanese search this place.

00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.240
They'll burst in with an explosion

00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:42.680
and carry out my bloody corpse.

00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:44.400
Is that the outcome you want?

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.440
That's your scenario, not mine.

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.160
What I want is to take you

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:50.480
and the intelligence out together.

00:16:50.480 --> 00:16:51.480
Do you understand?

00:16:51.480 --> 00:16:53.120
So all you can do is wait

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.320
for my arrangements.

00:16:54.480 --> 00:16:55.280
Is that clear?

00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:57.720
There's no time.

00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:59.800
For me,

00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:00.480
seizing the moment

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:02.760
is more important than waiting for an opportunity.

00:17:02.760 --> 00:17:03.600
Every extra day we stay here

00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:04.760
adds more risk.

00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:05.839
Executing this plan now

00:17:05.839 --> 00:17:07.079
is the greatest risk.

00:17:16.119 --> 00:17:17.520
If you're afraid,

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:19.800
you can stay behind.

00:17:20.079 --> 00:17:21.160
I'll go alone.

00:17:22.359 --> 00:17:23.040
Miss Ye,

00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:25.089
please ask your brother

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.079
to tell me the specific action plan

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:29.360
and contact information for the other party.

00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:30.360
I'll go by myself.

00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:32.480
If anything goes wrong,

00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:34.480
you know

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.680
I'll keep the secret.

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:39.040
I hope you can contact the National Government as soon as possible

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.000
to arrange for the second Believer to come.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:41.730
Don't speak.

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.040
Mr. Takeki.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:52.640
I don't think you have the authority

00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.400
to restrict my movements.

00:17:54.400 --> 00:17:55.120
That depends on whether your actions

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:56.480
interfere with mine.

00:17:56.480 --> 00:17:57.840
You're interfering with me right now.

00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:59.120
Are you not understanding what I'm saying?

00:17:59.120 --> 00:18:00.640
Are you in such a hurry to go out and die?

00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:02.160
He's injured.

00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:04.200
Don't get him so agitated, okay?

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:09.080
I'll go out first.

00:18:15.680 --> 00:18:16.560
Miss Ye.

00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:19.160
Could you please

00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.560
reconsider this matter?

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.000
You should rest first.

00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:29.480
Miss Ye.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:34.720
Please

00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:38.680
bring me more medicine as soon as possible.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:56.450
I can't wait any longer.

00:18:57.080 --> 00:18:58.810
My brothers are about to leave.

00:19:25.600 --> 00:19:26.920
Fall in!

00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:42.200
At ease.

00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:45.840
Men,

00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.800
I have good news and bad news.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.040
The good news is

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.850
our training here is complete.

00:19:54.680 --> 00:19:55.560
Tomorrow we'll fly to

00:19:55.560 --> 00:19:57.200
Alameda Naval Air Station.

00:19:57.960 --> 00:19:59.320
And we'll load our planes

00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:03.480
onto the aircraft carrier Hornet.

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.570
That's where our real mission will begin.

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.240
Some modules are not yet complete.

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.320
The Navy will use small vessels

00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.320
to transport them to the aircraft carrier

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.250
so we can complete assembly at sea.

00:20:15.600 --> 00:20:16.640
The bad news is

00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.520
not everyone can go.

00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:23.960
The Hornet can only accommodate

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.120
15 to 16 planes.

00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:28.920
This means that at least

00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:30.920
four crew members will be left behind

00:20:30.920 --> 00:20:32.780
to be reassigned by the military.

00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.480
If it were up to me,

00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.600
I would take all of you.

00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:43.760
Because you not only volunteered for

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:44.880
this mission,

00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:50.200
but have also proven yourselves

00:20:51.280 --> 00:20:52.400
to be the best

00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:54.530
and bravest pilots I've ever trained.

00:21:00.200 --> 00:21:01.800
Each one of you

00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:06.560
is extremely courageous and capable.

00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:17.320
I'm proud of each and every one of you.

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.240
Lieutenant,

00:21:22.680 --> 00:21:23.840
draw the lots.

00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:32.200
Men,

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:37.960
let's begin the draw.

00:21:39.560 --> 00:21:41.620
Blue means you're going to the fleet.

00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:47.480
Red means you stay behind.

00:21:51.800 --> 00:21:53.200
I'm sorry,

00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.040
truly.

00:21:57.920 --> 00:21:59.640
I know each of you

00:22:00.120 --> 00:22:02.600
has committed fully to this mission.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:05.840
Let's remember

00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:07.320
the war needs good pilots.

00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:10.640
As for the rest,

00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.640
trust that the Army will make

00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:14.160
good use of your skills.

00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:16.000
Tomorrow everyone

00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:17.060
will go to Alameda.

00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:19.960
Those who aren't flying will help with loading,

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.680
then wait there for reassignment by the Army.

00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.760
All right, boys.

00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:31.840
Time to draw lots.

00:22:57.400 --> 00:22:58.720
Let's go, young men.

00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:01.600
Colonel.

00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.080
What is this?

00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:05.160
The form includes all mechanical

00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.240
maintenance tasks.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.680
The base requires you to give an overall assessment.

00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:09.200
I don't have time

00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:10.280
to sign your complicated paperwork.

00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.120
Colonel, this is part of our job.

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:13.650
An evaluation is required.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:14.760
Please.

00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:17.720
Colonel Wright.

00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:18.360
Alright.

00:23:19.240 --> 00:23:20.280
Long-winded?

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.880
Colonel, I need you to clarify

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:25.080
which part of our work was long-winded,

00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:26.520
Colonel.

00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:15.690
When you go back,

00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.760
have your father contact Macau immediately

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:19.960
to cancel tomorrow night's operation.

00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.920
The Major's current physical condition

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:22.680
has caused him to lose

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.520
his objective and calm judgment of matters.

00:24:24.520 --> 00:24:26.200
Acting rashly is too risky.

00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.540
I firmly disagree.

00:24:30.480 --> 00:24:31.340
Did you hear me?

00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:23.760
Director, Commander Yuan is here to pick us up.

00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.640
Director Shen.

00:25:32.240 --> 00:25:33.100
Director Shen.

00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.400
Commander of the Third Column, Fourth War Zone,

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.640
Yuan Dai, County Magistrate of Zhongshan,

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:41.120
ordered to welcome you.

00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:42.080
Oh my!

00:25:42.240 --> 00:25:43.170
Commander Yuan,

00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:44.720
I've long admired your reputation.

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.120
Stop the sedan chair.

00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:47.160
Wait.

00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.820
Director Shen,

00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:51.480
since Zhongshan County fell,

00:25:51.480 --> 00:25:53.010
I've moved my headquarters

00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:55.280
from Xinhui to Heshan.

00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:57.080
Recently relocated to Shaping,

00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:57.960
just ahead.

00:25:58.120 --> 00:25:59.480
Please come and see it.

00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:01.330
Sure, let's take a look.

00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:05.280
Such an elite commander.

00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.530
Thank you for your trouble.

00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.520
First squad assembly complete.

00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:14.840
Second squad assembly complete.

00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.600
Fourth squad assembly complete.

00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.120
Fifth squad assembly complete.

00:26:18.120 --> 00:26:19.320
Seventh squad assembly complete.

00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:21.180
Eighth squad assembly complete.

00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.280
From now on.

00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:29.360
Inoue, divide your men into four teams.

00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:33.240
First to third teams will enter through the Tan family bay entrance.

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.400
Any villager who leaves

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:36.530
must be registered.

00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:37.760
Any unusual situation with the villagers

00:26:37.760 --> 00:26:39.490
must be reported immediately.

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.360
Five people from each of the three teams

00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:43.840
bring your tools.

00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:45.320
Starting today,

00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:46.960
dig out all hidden underground

00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:47.560
secret rooms, cellars, and false walls

00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.960
search every household thoroughly.

00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:49.920
Especially those

00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:50.640
wealthy households on the island.

00:26:50.640 --> 00:26:52.300
Make sure no corner is missed.

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.200
But captain,

00:26:53.200 --> 00:26:55.530
we've already searched all these places.

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:56.640
Then search again.

00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:00.240
Can you guarantee there are no fish that slipped through the net?

00:27:00.480 --> 00:27:02.280
What about the fourth team?

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:04.080
I want 24-hour surveillance

00:27:04.080 --> 00:27:04.800
on every move of the Ye family.

00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:06.160
Report immediately if anything happens.

00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:06.690
Yes, sir.

00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:09.040
Sasaki.

00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:09.520
Here.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:10.240
Reserve the second platoon

00:27:10.240 --> 00:27:12.920
to be ready for perimeter operations in the next two days.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:17.720
Focus on the area starting from Tanjiawan Village,

00:27:17.720 --> 00:27:20.520
search every mountain and village you encounter.

00:27:20.680 --> 00:27:21.720
Especially those

00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:25.200
abandoned villages and deserted graveyards.

00:27:25.200 --> 00:27:25.730
Yes, sir.

00:27:26.200 --> 00:27:26.720
Well,

00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.490
let's begin the operation.

00:27:31.200 --> 00:27:31.720
Inoue.

00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:32.560
Yes?

00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:38.730
You'll guard the entrance to Tanjiawan village.

00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:40.480
If Ye Biying leaves

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.040
or if the Colonel enters Tanjiawan village

00:27:42.040 --> 00:27:43.240
to contact Ye Biying,

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.220
report to me immediately.

00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:46.360
Yes, sir.

00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.480
Are you suspicious of Ye Biying

00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:50.400
or our Colonel?

00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.120
Stop asking unnecessary questions.

00:27:52.120 --> 00:27:53.120
Go now.

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:56.380
Operation begins.

00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:00.240
About face!

00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:03.480
Forward march.

00:28:14.120 --> 00:28:15.880
[Document box]

00:28:20.040 --> 00:28:20.400
Are these all the files

00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.360
on General Dajiao Censheng?

00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:21.880
Yes.

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.120
These are all the files

00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:24.320
after his plane crash in North Huangyang Mountain.

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:25.080
All the information is complete.

00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.210
Everything's here.

00:28:27.680 --> 00:28:29.010
Alright, I understand.

00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:30.900
I'll take my leave.

00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:32.250
Report, sir.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:32.740
Come in.

00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.680
The captain has made all arrangements.

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.640
Take these files.

00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:44.050
We'll go to the garrison together.

00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:47.480
Let's curry favor with that envoy from the palace.

00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:53.320
Salute!

00:28:55.400 --> 00:28:55.860
Please.

00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:15.880
Oh my,

00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:17.490
Commander Yuan.

00:29:17.800 --> 00:29:19.660
This place of yours is quite nice.

00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.320
This is Ming Dynasty architecture, isn't it?

00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:24.920
Director Shen, you flatter me.

00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.200
It's modest.

00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:30.680
Please take the seat of honor.

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:31.480
May I sit?

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:33.760
Director Shen, now that you're here,

00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.490
you must take the seat of honor.

00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.530
Commander Yuan,

00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:44.360
last year,

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:46.240
when you handed over the items

00:29:46.240 --> 00:29:48.500
from Dajiao Chensheng's crashed plane,

00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.320
the intelligence inside was extremely valuable.

00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:53.640
I specifically

00:29:53.800 --> 00:29:56.130
submitted a commendation report for you.

00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:58.280
I have good news for you.

00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.000
Don't point that gun at people.

00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:05.400
Oh!

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.080
Director Shen,

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:06.810
I'm so sorry.

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:07.360
Sorry.

00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:10.080
Before I left,

00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:12.040
the higher-ups said they would reward you

00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:13.700
with 100,000 silver dollars.

00:30:14.600 --> 00:30:16.060
Thank you, Director Shen.

00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:18.460
Thank you, Director Shen.

00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:20.960
Tell me about

00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:22.520
the current situation here.

00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:23.040
Well,

00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.060
don't even mention it.

00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.880
All these coastal districts

00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:31.620
have fallen into Japanese hands.

00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:33.080
Where are our people?

00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:36.080
This January,

00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.600
I had the district chiefs

00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.360
of districts one, two, and five,

00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:41.920
take all their personnel

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:44.490
and secretly return to Zhongshan County.

00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:45.760
I ordered them to

00:30:45.760 --> 00:30:48.040
establish district governments behind enemy lines

00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:50.370
and our party's special operations unit.

00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:53.860
Which of our people is closest to Sanzao Island?

00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.520
The closest to Sanzao Island

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.480
is Commander Liang Weihe's Provisional Seventh Detachment.

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:08.600
They've been operating in the Eighth District of Zhongshan.

00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:11.800
The closest to Sanzao Island should be

00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.880
the Second Battalion of the Seventh Detachment.

00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:16.400
The battalion commander is Chen Zhongjian.

00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:19.120
However,

00:31:26.520 --> 00:31:28.560
This troop used to be

00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:32.360
the 8th District Communist Anti-Japanese Guerrilla Unit.

00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.120
Haven't they been incorporated now?

00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.280
But don't worry.

00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.360
The men under my command, Yuan's command,

00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.800
I don't care if they're Communists

00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:41.880
or Nationalists.

00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:44.320
They must pass my test.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.140
After declaring war on Japan,

00:31:48.160 --> 00:31:49.760
the Fourth War Zone Command

00:31:50.040 --> 00:31:51.400
reorganized all these

00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.280
scattered Communist guerrilla units

00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:55.280
into this Second Battalion.

00:31:55.680 --> 00:31:56.940
After they assembled,

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.320
they've been operating separately in the 8th District.

00:32:00.320 --> 00:32:01.180
Their location

00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.130
is around Huangyang Mountain.

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:06.530
They're just separated from Sanzao Island by a sea channel.

00:32:07.280 --> 00:32:08.210
Commander Yuan,

00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:09.720
how many troops

00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:12.000
do you have in total when fully assembled?

00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:14.040
About a thousand men in total.

00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:17.480
How long will it take to gather them?

00:32:17.760 --> 00:32:18.960
My men are on standby.

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:20.480
Two days at most.

00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:22.980
Are they easy to mobilize?

00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:24.160
Yes, they are.

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:25.760
I'm here

00:32:25.760 --> 00:32:27.820
to ask for your help with two matters.

00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:28.960
First,

00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.450
after some time,

00:32:30.840 --> 00:32:33.360
I need you to accompany me to Huangyang Mountain.

00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.800
I want to visit Dajiao Chensheng,

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.080
the plane crash site,

00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:37.480
and survey the terrain.

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:39.660
In a couple of days,

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:41.480
some Japanese will arrive there.

00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.000
I need you to organize your forces

00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.400
to ambush them.

00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:45.880
Ambush the Japanese?

00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:46.920
Yes.

00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:49.480
Director Shen,

00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.320
is this intelligence

00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:53.360
reliable?

00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.530
I'll arrange it right away.

00:32:58.640 --> 00:32:59.120
Second,

00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:00.680
do you have someone under your command called

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:01.560
Wu Fazi?

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:04.400
What's his position?

00:33:05.400 --> 00:33:07.480
He's from the 7th Training Battalion,

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:08.540
deputy commander.

00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:09.360
Is he here

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:09.920
now?

00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:11.360
Get him over here.

00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:12.290
I need to see him.

00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:12.890
Alright.

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:14.000
Yuan Ming.

00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:18.280
Ride quickly

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:20.010
to the 7th Training Battalion.

00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:22.160
Bring Deputy Captain Wu Fazi

00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.560
to the headquarters.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.040
Excuse me.

00:33:35.920 --> 00:33:36.520
Sir.

00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:39.480
The investigator from Tokyo

00:33:39.480 --> 00:33:41.800
has established his investigation unit.

00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:43.130
But the name is strange.

00:33:43.400 --> 00:33:45.120
It's called the Sixth Aviation Base,

00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.920
Freshwater Supply Investigation Headquarters.

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:51.360
A name is just a symbol.

00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:53.080
How has the Special Police Unit

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.480
been doing these days?

00:33:55.960 --> 00:33:58.820
Is Captain Oshima still looking for that American?

00:33:59.120 --> 00:33:59.680
Yes.

00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:01.760
Captain Oshima seems convinced

00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:02.920
that the American is hiding on the island,

00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:04.080
so he sends out police squads every day

00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:05.680
to search the entire island.

00:34:07.080 --> 00:34:08.400
Stubborn fellow.

00:34:09.199 --> 00:34:10.280
If it weren't for those damn hawks

00:34:10.280 --> 00:34:11.739
provoking the Americans,

00:34:12.360 --> 00:34:14.920
the Americans might not have come from so far away

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:17.480
to join such a war.

00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:18.480
Yes,

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:19.480
you're right.

00:34:20.480 --> 00:34:21.639
The hawk officers are gaining momentum now,

00:34:21.639 --> 00:34:23.639
with victories throughout Southeast Asia.

00:34:23.639 --> 00:34:24.639
It seems to prove that all the hawks' predictions

00:34:24.639 --> 00:34:25.440
were correct.

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.020
But I believe this situation won't last.

00:34:29.400 --> 00:34:30.600
When you fly over

00:34:30.719 --> 00:34:32.239
America someday,

00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.239
see how many chimneys are down there,

00:34:35.719 --> 00:34:38.960
and you'll know you're wrong.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.120
Everyone.

00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:47.960
Does anyone here know

00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:50.489
what the slogan of the Meiji Restoration was?

00:34:51.639 --> 00:34:54.719
It was 'Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians.'

00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:56.600
Well said, Akino.

00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.760
Loyalty to His Majesty the Emperor

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:01.840
is the most precious treasure

00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.480
in each of your lives.

00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:06.080
This is a top-secret investigation.

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.920
Before I announce your mission,

00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:09.000
Akino.

00:35:09.600 --> 00:35:10.920
I need you to lead everyone

00:35:10.920 --> 00:35:12.960
in swearing to His Majesty

00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.690
that you will keep this secret.

00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.160
Take the oath!

00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.000
Protect the Emperor!

00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:22.600
Absolute loyalty!

00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.360
Follow orders!

00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:25.960
Keep secrets!

00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.010
Let's begin.

00:35:34.840 --> 00:35:35.970
General Ōsumi Mineo

00:35:37.480 --> 00:35:40.280
His Imperial Majesty's military council advisor

00:35:40.480 --> 00:35:41.560
He has served as

00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:44.720
the Second Fleet Commander

00:35:45.720 --> 00:35:48.960
and twice as the Minister of Navy.

00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:51.890
His Imperial Majesty granted him the title of Baron.

00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:53.760
He is also one of

00:35:53.760 --> 00:35:55.690
the Emperor's closest ministers.

00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:01.160
The day after the Manchurian Incident,

00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.200
General Ōsumi clearly stated in the cabinet

00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.840
that he supported the Southern Expansion Doctrine,

00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.600
firmly advocating for launching the Pacific War

00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:10.800
and declaring war on America and Britain.

00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.600
General Ōsumi

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.080
is a leader greatly admired by our navy.

00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:19.120
However, there are some people

00:36:19.120 --> 00:36:20.760
who are dissatisfied with his position,

00:36:20.760 --> 00:36:22.160
even furious,

00:36:22.480 --> 00:36:23.920
and they decided

00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.400
to take the most severe measures of revenge against General Ōsumi.

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.800
Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has confirmed

00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:31.800
that two instructors from the Marine Corps

00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:34.460
training base were involved in this operation.

00:36:34.760 --> 00:36:36.480
They are Teikichi Saji

00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.120
and Ryukichi Ohashi.

00:36:38.840 --> 00:36:39.760
One of them

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:41.120
poisoned the food at Uoya Restaurant,

00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.580
which General Daikaku frequently visited.

00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:45.400
The other one

00:36:45.920 --> 00:36:47.480
planted a bomb in General Daikaku's car,

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:48.520
killing

00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.200
his driver and secretary.

00:36:52.680 --> 00:36:53.560
Fortunately,

00:36:54.480 --> 00:36:57.680
General Daikaku survived both assassination attempts.

00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:01.120
However, in February last year,

00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.560
by order of His Majesty the Emperor,

00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:05.240
General Daikaku

00:37:05.360 --> 00:37:07.800
came to inspect the China theater

00:37:07.800 --> 00:37:10.060
as an Imperial Headquarters inspector.

00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:13.820
His plane suddenly crashed at Huangyang Mountain nearby,

00:37:13.840 --> 00:37:15.560
killing him

00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.690
under mysterious circumstances.

00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.600
You don't need to know any more details.

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.970
You only need to know one thing.

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:25.560
[Sheng Junhai]

00:37:25.560 --> 00:37:27.360
His Majesty the Emperor is

00:37:27.360 --> 00:37:28.720
extremely angry about this matter.

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:30.000
That's why he sent me

00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.280
here to investigate and uncover the truth.

00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:33.140
[Sheng Junhai]

00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:37.280
The special police force on the island

00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:39.040
is controlled by the hawks.

00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:40.800
I don't trust them.

00:37:41.680 --> 00:37:42.080
So yesterday,

00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.080
Commander Fujita and I decided

00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:47.200
to deploy our bravest anti-aircraft artillery unit

00:37:47.200 --> 00:37:49.080
to assist with my investigation.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.330
Is everyone clear about what needs to be done?

00:38:05.240 --> 00:38:05.920
Hasegawa.

00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:18.850
This letter is from your hometown.

00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:20.520
Your brother cares about you.

00:38:20.520 --> 00:38:21.850
You have a good brother.

00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:26.120
Thank you for your trouble, Captain Oshima.

00:38:27.320 --> 00:38:28.720
No need for formalities.

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:30.000
Alright.

00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.480
May I call you Mr. Oshima?

00:38:32.480 --> 00:38:33.160
Yes.

00:38:35.120 --> 00:38:36.080
Captain Oshima,

00:38:36.240 --> 00:38:37.840
your instructions, please.

00:38:39.320 --> 00:38:40.180
It's like this.

00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:43.080
That Chinese woman

00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:44.720
brought by the Colonel, have you seen her?

00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:45.380
Yes, I have.

00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:48.040
As soon as she appears at the airport barracks looking for the Colonel,

00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:50.240
report to me by telephone immediately.

00:38:51.240 --> 00:38:52.040
Also,

00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:53.920
if the Colonel goes out to find her,

00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:55.780
you must report that to me as well.

00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.000
Yes, sir.

00:38:58.400 --> 00:38:59.530
I'm counting on you.

00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:04.720
I'm sorry.

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:06.160
The Colonel is holding an emergency meeting.

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:07.620
No one is allowed to enter.

00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.780
I have important documents here.

00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:12.640
Then please wait for a while.

00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:14.490
[Set]

00:39:14.840 --> 00:39:15.300
[Check]

00:39:16.320 --> 00:39:16.600
[Box]

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:17.060
[Check]

00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:17.640
[Set]

00:39:20.240 --> 00:39:21.680
We need to go to Huangyang Mountain

00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:23.840
to the crash site of General Dajiao Censheng

00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.570
for an on-site investigation.

00:39:26.040 --> 00:39:27.040
Captain Akino,

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:29.400
please prepare a detailed plan

00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:30.760
to submit to Commander Fujita,

00:39:30.760 --> 00:39:32.000
and notify the patrol boat unit

00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.920
to fully support our operation.

00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:45.170
Colonel.

00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:46.560
Captain Oshima,

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:48.090
what brings you here today?

00:39:48.120 --> 00:39:49.480
Can we talk inside?

00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:50.840
Sure,

00:39:51.240 --> 00:39:51.920
come on in.

00:39:52.680 --> 00:39:53.410
Take a break.

00:39:53.480 --> 00:39:54.080
Yes, sir.

00:39:54.640 --> 00:39:55.500
Captain Oshima

00:39:55.640 --> 00:39:56.680
What brings you here?

00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:58.080
Colonel, today actually

00:39:58.480 --> 00:39:59.480
Sasaki

00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:01.400
We heard that you came to this island

00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:03.360
because of General Dajiao's case

00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:06.690
We immediately retrieved all the case files from that time.

00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:16.920
I've just arrived here

00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:18.400
and don't have much information yet.

00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.330
Thank you for bringing these to me.

00:40:21.480 --> 00:40:22.120
Colonel

00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:23.800
About what happened in the past

00:40:23.800 --> 00:40:25.520
please forgive us.

00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:25.840
Oh

00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:26.840
it's fine.

00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:28.200
As long as you don't doubt my identity as an investigator

00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:29.600
that's all that matters.

00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:32.400
Of course

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:35.200
I wouldn't dare doubt someone sent by the Emperor.

00:40:35.200 --> 00:40:35.840
By the way

00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:39.480
that Chinese woman you brought with you

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:42.520
makes us a bit uneasy.

00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:43.960
To be honest

00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:45.040
Chinese people can't be trusted.

00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:45.840
Really?

00:40:46.240 --> 00:40:47.440
I don't feel that way.

00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:50.700
Perhaps you haven't seen a beautiful woman in too long?

00:40:54.240 --> 00:40:56.320
You and I are both fighting to win this holy war.

00:40:56.320 --> 00:40:58.120
There's no conflict between us.

00:40:58.560 --> 00:40:59.240
I'm really glad

00:40:59.240 --> 00:41:00.300
you think that way.

00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:00.960
Thank you.

00:41:01.920 --> 00:41:02.480
So

00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.890
let's have dinner together today.

00:41:05.480 --> 00:41:06.160
I'm sorry

00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:08.080
I've already promised to host

00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:10.080
the officers from the anti-aircraft unit tonight.

00:41:10.080 --> 00:41:10.640
Another time.

00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:12.000
I'll treat you another day.

00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:12.880
I understand.

00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:14.520
I'll take my leave then.

00:41:20.360 --> 00:41:23.120
What is Oshima Hiroshi's true purpose

00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:24.280
this time?

00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:29.400
Japanese soldiers are everywhere outside today.

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:29.920
Mother-in-law,

00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:30.720
I understand.

00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:32.880
There are Japanese soldiers

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:34.280
at Caotang Mountain too.

00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:36.200
But I need to check on

00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:37.260
Major White first.

00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:38.280
Is that okay?

00:41:38.280 --> 00:41:40.340
I'll act according to the situation.

00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:41.680
Father.

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.330
Where are you going?

00:41:43.880 --> 00:41:44.480
I...

00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:49.120
I'm going to see Major White.

00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:52.120
There are so many Japanese soldiers outside.

00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:54.280
Why don't you think before you act?

00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:55.800
But his injuries...

00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:57.060
I'm worried about him.

00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.480
I didn't say you couldn't go.

00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:02.120
What do you mean?

00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.680
Qingming Festival is coming soon.

00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:05.760
No matter how arrogant these Japanese are,

00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:08.960
they can't stop us from paying respects to our ancestors.

00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.280
What I mean is,

00:42:10.920 --> 00:42:12.480
I'll go with you.

00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:15.820
You're always the clever one.
