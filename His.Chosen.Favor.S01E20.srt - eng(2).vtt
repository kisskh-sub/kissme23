(The Most Familiar Stranger)

00:00:27.396 --> 00:00:29.056
=Episode 20=

00:00:33.494 --> 00:00:34.614
You're terrified.

00:00:34.814 --> 00:00:36.694
(What's going on?)

00:00:36.694 --> 00:00:38.494
Drag him out and dismember him.

00:00:38.494 --> 00:00:40.214
(Never mind. Save Fu An first.)

00:00:40.214 --> 00:00:40.854
Yes.

00:00:40.854 --> 00:00:41.814
Wait!

00:00:42.254 --> 00:00:43.694
He tried to assassinate me.

00:00:43.694 --> 00:00:44.774
Killing him like this

00:00:44.774 --> 00:00:46.054
would be far too merciful.

00:00:46.414 --> 00:00:47.694
What do you suggest?

00:00:49.254 --> 00:00:50.854
Throw him into the prison.

00:00:50.854 --> 00:00:52.054
I'll make him suffer.

00:00:52.654 --> 00:00:55.014
Good! Truly worthy of being my empress.

00:00:55.974 --> 00:00:57.454
Lu Zhen'er! Xiao Yicheng!

00:00:57.614 --> 00:00:59.454
You adulterous ones will die horribly!

00:00:59.574 --> 00:01:01.414
Drag him away now!

00:01:01.414 --> 00:01:02.094
- Yes!
- Yes!

00:01:02.654 --> 00:01:03.334
Move!

00:01:08.334 --> 00:01:10.414
You're acting so strangely today.

00:01:11.534 --> 00:01:12.174
What?

00:01:12.974 --> 00:01:14.374
Strange?

00:01:14.374 --> 00:01:15.574
Not at all.

00:01:16.174 --> 00:01:17.094
Let's sleep.

00:01:20.294 --> 00:01:21.094
Your Majesty,

00:01:21.694 --> 00:01:24.014
I was frightened just now

00:01:24.014 --> 00:01:25.534
and feel a bit unwell now.

00:01:25.894 --> 00:01:27.614
- Summon the imperial physician.
- No.

00:01:28.214 --> 00:01:30.174
I need to sleep alone.

00:01:32.174 --> 00:01:32.694
Alright.

00:01:33.534 --> 00:01:35.174
Rest well today.

00:01:35.334 --> 00:01:36.534
I will visit you tomorrow.

00:01:41.454 --> 00:01:43.054
(Everything has changed.)

00:01:43.054 --> 00:01:44.814
(Where is Xiao Wenjing?)

00:01:44.814 --> 00:01:46.454
(I must ask Fu An about it.)

00:01:53.574 --> 00:01:54.134
Fu An.

00:01:54.654 --> 00:01:55.774
Are you here to kill me?

00:01:56.334 --> 00:01:57.334
Fu An!

00:01:57.574 --> 00:01:59.214
Why did I wake up to find

00:01:59.214 --> 00:02:01.254
Xiao Yicheng has become the Emperor?

00:02:01.254 --> 00:02:02.574
Where is Xiao Wenjing?

00:02:02.574 --> 00:02:03.974
Where is the real Xiao Wenjing?

00:02:03.974 --> 00:02:04.854
Kill me if you must.

00:02:04.854 --> 00:02:05.694
Stop pretending.

00:02:05.694 --> 00:02:07.254
I'm not pretending!

00:02:07.254 --> 00:02:09.694
What about Yindan?

00:02:09.694 --> 00:02:12.054
Does Yindan exist in this world?

00:02:12.054 --> 00:02:13.934
What year is it now?

00:02:13.934 --> 00:02:15.334
Which world am I in?

00:02:15.694 --> 00:02:17.374
Yindan died three months ago.

00:02:17.374 --> 00:02:18.654
What are you talking about?

00:02:20.174 --> 00:02:21.334
Three months?

00:02:22.494 --> 00:02:25.934
Did she die on the night
of her birthday?

00:02:26.174 --> 00:02:27.294
Yes.

00:02:28.254 --> 00:02:31.894
That day, I brought a cake.

00:02:31.894 --> 00:02:33.454
You were setting off fireworks outside.

00:02:34.614 --> 00:02:37.094
Xiao Wenjing and I pushed the door open

00:02:37.094 --> 00:02:38.574
and saw my sister...

00:02:38.574 --> 00:02:40.574
But that happened months ago!

00:02:41.374 --> 00:02:43.894
So after three months,

00:02:43.894 --> 00:02:45.654
I'm still in this world?

00:02:47.494 --> 00:02:49.294
Xiao Wenjing and I
were just at the seaside.

00:02:49.574 --> 00:02:51.614
Why did I suddenly skip
to three months later?

00:02:51.614 --> 00:02:53.014
What actually happened?

00:02:53.014 --> 00:02:54.214
Tell me!

00:02:54.214 --> 00:02:56.334
You and Xiao Yicheng conspired,

00:02:56.334 --> 00:02:58.614
plunged the court into chaos,
and imprisoned His Majesty!

00:03:02.334 --> 00:03:04.734
After Xiao Yicheng ascended the throne,
he made you Empress.

00:03:04.734 --> 00:03:06.614
You killed all the maids and eunuchs

00:03:06.614 --> 00:03:08.854
in the Zhaohua Hall and the Zichen Hall.

00:03:20.494 --> 00:03:21.094
Besides,

00:03:21.374 --> 00:03:24.094
you both are obsessed
with elixir of immortality.

00:03:24.494 --> 00:03:27.134
Hearing that blood of boys and girls
could be used in the potion,

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:28.254
you even...

00:03:30.294 --> 00:03:31.694
I did all this?

00:03:31.694 --> 00:03:32.214
Yes.

00:03:32.374 --> 00:03:34.294
You controlled His Majesty's mind,

00:03:34.294 --> 00:03:35.534
so he lost his true self.

00:03:37.014 --> 00:03:37.894
Which one?

00:03:39.054 --> 00:03:41.534
My heart holds only one.

00:03:42.294 --> 00:03:44.214
Xiao Wenjing is still alive?

00:03:44.854 --> 00:03:45.974
I haven't seen

00:03:46.694 --> 00:03:48.294
His Majesty for a very long time.

00:03:54.974 --> 00:03:57.734
(All living beings have
their destined fate.)

00:04:00.174 --> 00:04:02.254
(I must find Xiao Yicheng)

00:04:02.254 --> 00:04:04.534
(to learn where Xiao Wenjing is.)

00:04:12.134 --> 00:04:14.254
Zhen'er, what brings you here?

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:15.374
I want to see Xiao Wenjing.

00:04:16.014 --> 00:04:17.854
Why are you suddenly
concerned about him?

00:04:18.174 --> 00:04:20.414
I need to speak with him. Where is he?

00:04:20.414 --> 00:04:21.814
What's going on?

00:04:21.814 --> 00:04:23.054
Where is he?

00:04:23.214 --> 00:04:25.494
You've been very strange these days.

00:04:28.894 --> 00:04:30.054
Let me see Xiao Wenjing.

00:04:30.734 --> 00:04:32.894
You may speak to me properly.

00:04:32.894 --> 00:04:33.774
What are you doing?

00:04:33.774 --> 00:04:35.174
Let me see Xiao Wenjing!

00:05:02.094 --> 00:05:03.134
(Thank goodness,)

00:05:03.894 --> 00:05:05.094

I'm Lu Zhen'er, Xiao Wenjing.

00:05:47.854 --> 00:05:48.534
Let go.

00:05:52.534 --> 00:05:53.974
You want to kill me?

Zhen'er,

00:06:12.094 --> 00:06:13.174
you've forgotten me again.

00:06:13.854 --> 00:06:15.134
I'm the Emperor.

00:06:16.654 --> 00:06:18.014
You are the Emperor?

00:06:18.694 --> 00:06:19.734
Yes.

00:06:20.334 --> 00:06:22.054
You're the late emperor?

00:06:22.054 --> 00:06:22.774
Yes.

00:06:24.454 --> 00:06:25.294
Why?

00:06:26.534 --> 00:06:27.574
Why?

00:06:29.174 --> 00:06:30.214
This is impossible.

00:06:31.054 --> 00:06:32.734
This is impossible.

00:06:33.174 --> 00:06:34.534
Impossible.

00:06:36.094 --> 00:06:37.934
This is impossible.

00:06:38.974 --> 00:06:42.614
Why?

00:07:00.454 --> 00:07:01.214
Why are there

00:07:01.214 --> 00:07:03.294
so many weird things in this palace?

00:07:04.174 --> 00:07:05.814
I'll have them cleared out tomorrow.

00:07:20.974 --> 00:07:24.374
(Why isn't the world reset?)

00:07:24.374 --> 00:07:27.654
(Why is Yindan dead?)

00:07:27.654 --> 00:07:30.614
(Why doesn't Xiao Wenjing remember me?)

00:07:32.814 --> 00:07:35.094
(Why is he standing before me,)

00:07:35.094 --> 00:07:36.814
(yet so distant?)

00:07:37.814 --> 00:07:38.894
(Why?)

00:07:40.014 --> 00:07:40.694
(No.)

00:07:41.534 --> 00:07:43.854
(I must get to the bottom of this.)

00:07:51.974 --> 00:07:52.774
Xiao Wenjing,

00:07:53.574 --> 00:07:55.574
do you not remember me?

00:07:55.574 --> 00:07:56.894
I'm Lu Zhen'er!

00:07:57.414 --> 00:07:58.174
Let go!

00:08:02.014 --> 00:08:03.414
Xiao Wenjing,

00:08:03.414 --> 00:08:04.854
look at me closely.

00:08:06.294 --> 00:08:07.294
I'm Lu Zhen'er!

00:08:11.214 --> 00:08:12.254
You recognize me, right?

00:08:13.494 --> 00:08:14.934
You are my father's wife,

the Empress of Beizhao.

00:08:16.974 --> 00:08:18.614
Such behavior

00:08:20.014 --> 00:08:21.294
is improper!

00:08:23.694 --> 00:08:24.334
Xiao...

Qing'er, you're here.

00:08:26.734 --> 00:08:28.654
As you hadn't returned,

00:08:28.654 --> 00:08:29.934
I came looking for you.

00:08:31.654 --> 00:08:34.254
What did you say to Her Majesty?

00:08:34.334 --> 00:08:36.054
Why is she crying so much?

00:08:36.534 --> 00:08:37.854
She chose to cry.

00:08:39.254 --> 00:08:41.934
Wenjing, she is the Empress.

00:08:41.934 --> 00:08:44.294
You should show her some respect.

00:08:45.414 --> 00:08:46.974
Alright, I'll listen to you.

00:08:48.334 --> 00:08:49.574
Your Majesty,

00:08:49.574 --> 00:08:51.734
we shall take our leave now.

00:09:02.334 --> 00:09:03.134
Stop!

00:09:09.014 --> 00:09:10.454
Let him go!

00:09:14.574 --> 00:09:15.654
Don't you bully her!

00:09:17.334 --> 00:09:18.174
Your Majesty,

00:09:18.174 --> 00:09:19.014
are you alright?

00:09:19.894 --> 00:09:21.254
She is your Qing'er.

00:09:22.054 --> 00:09:23.054
Then who am I?

00:09:23.494 --> 00:09:24.894
You are the Empress of Beizhao.

00:09:29.774 --> 00:09:30.974
Qing'er, let's go.

00:09:31.334 --> 00:09:32.534
Xiao Wenjing,

00:09:32.534 --> 00:09:34.814
do you prefer kebabs or spicy hot pot?

00:09:36.534 --> 00:09:37.654
How about a beach barbecue?

00:09:38.094 --> 00:09:40.294
Yes! I haven't been
to the beach for long.

00:09:40.294 --> 00:09:41.694
Since I'm the heroine,

00:09:41.694 --> 00:09:42.934
you must be the hero.

00:09:42.934 --> 00:09:44.334
In our female-centric stories,

00:09:44.334 --> 00:09:46.054
whoever the heroine chooses is the hero.

00:09:46.054 --> 00:09:47.214
No arguments.

00:09:51.454 --> 00:09:53.294
Nice to meet you.

00:09:56.334 --> 00:09:58.374

00:10:43.534 --> 00:10:44.934
What happened?

00:10:44.934 --> 00:10:46.694
(Even if she was pregnant,)

00:10:46.694 --> 00:10:48.254
(it's only been three months.)

00:10:48.254 --> 00:10:49.614
(How can she give birth?)

00:10:49.614 --> 00:10:50.814
(But she is alive,)

00:10:50.814 --> 00:10:52.014
(perhaps from her,)

00:10:52.014 --> 00:10:53.294
(I can find a different answer.)

00:10:53.814 --> 00:10:55.374
I don't know either.

00:10:55.374 --> 00:10:57.614
But Your Majesty instructed

00:10:58.294 --> 00:10:59.854
to invite you there

00:10:59.854 --> 00:11:01.454
on the day she gives birth,

00:11:01.454 --> 00:11:03.174
saying you want to see

00:11:03.174 --> 00:11:04.774
what kind of monster

00:11:04.774 --> 00:11:06.174
she will give birth to.

00:11:06.334 --> 00:11:09.494
(Did I say something so wicked?)

00:11:09.494 --> 00:11:11.534
(Never mind, I'll go check it out.)

00:11:12.134 --> 00:11:13.134
Take me there.

00:11:13.414 --> 00:11:14.054
Yes.

00:11:39.814 --> 00:11:40.534
Get out!

00:11:41.134 --> 00:11:41.934
Get out!

00:11:45.454 --> 00:11:46.254
Get out!

00:11:47.134 --> 00:11:48.734
Get out of here!
