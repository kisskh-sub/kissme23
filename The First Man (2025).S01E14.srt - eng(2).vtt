00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:03.380
(Episode 14)

00:00:03.510 --> 00:00:07.410
Hong Ju, don't worry.
I've got it all figured out.

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.680
I'm here to see the Chairman right now,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.650
so I want you to come a little later.
Got it?

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:28.700
Please accept my formal bow, Chairman.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.440
A formal bow?

00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:35.240
I've come to bid you a final farewell.

00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:42.510
What's all this? "Final" farewell?
Goodness!

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.350
Mrs. Yeom, are you leaving?

00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:46.380
Oh my, are you sick? You don't look well.

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.720
Are you in a lot of pain?

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.620
Here, have a seat. Go on, sit down.

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.730
What's the point of living
in this cruel world?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.870
I was nearly 40 when I first met you,

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.810
but before that,
because of my husband's gambling habit,

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:11.240
I had to run away with Hong Ju
and barely managed to get a divorce.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.680
Then I met CEO Chae
and started working as her coordinator...

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:19.020
I already know all of that.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.790
And I had to put up with
all of CEO Chae's abuse.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:26.420
There were times I felt so hopeless
that I would swallow my pride...

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:27.930
and just wanted to die.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.530
But the only reason I could grit my teeth
and keep going was...

00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:33.870
for my one and only daughter, Hong Ju.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.200
I've lived to see her succeed.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:38.340
I know that.

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.040
And being by your side like this,

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:44.580
serving you, has been an honor.

00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:48.180
I gave CEO Chae a piece of my mind.
Is she still keeping you away from here?

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.580
- Is that what this is about?
- Now I'll never be...

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:52.380
able to see you again.

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.960
Now I'm being sent far away to India
to waste away from sickness.

00:01:57.260 --> 00:01:59.220
What are you talking about? India?

00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:02.160
CEO Chae...

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:05.600
has transferred my Hong Ju to India.

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.670
I have no idea what she's supposed to do
in that faraway land.

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.110
My daughter and I will go to India
and just die, Chairman.

00:02:16.170 --> 00:02:19.440
She transferred Hong Ju to India?

00:02:19.810 --> 00:02:22.980
And she did it without even consulting me?

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:27.590
I'm sure CEO Chae thought
long and hard about it.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.990
But at the end of the day,

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:34.390
this is about her determination
to tear you and me apart.

00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:36.860
What else could this be...

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.430
but the result of her ambitious
and "thoughtful" scheming?

00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:55.110
I wonder what Lawyer Kang looks like.

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.890
He's here.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:02.850
- Come on in.
- Oh my gosh, what do I do?

00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:04.260
Make yourself at home.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:09.930
Hello. It's a pleasure to meet you all.
My name is Kang Baek Ho...

00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:12.230
Welcome.

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:13.870
What?

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.330
You!

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.100
- It can't be.
- Rude Pervert?

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:20.070
- The Rude Guitar?
- What's going on?

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.540
Do you two know each other?

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.240
Jang Mi, what's going on?

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:28.350
Hey, why did you call him a jerk?

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:29.950
What is all this?

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:32.120
It's nothing.

00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.730
- It's nothing?
- It's just we have a history.

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:46.600
We just know each other from around,

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.330
but I didn't expect to see you here.

00:03:49.130 --> 00:03:50.440
Tell me about it.

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.370
What's going on?

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.340
You've run into Lawyer Kang before?

00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:59.740
What a small world.
Come on, have a seat. Please, sit down.

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.080
Yes, Mr. Oh.
Ms. Jung, you said you like roses, right?

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.750
I hate flowers.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.020
The thorns will prick you.
I prefer cookies.

00:04:14.990 --> 00:04:17.400
- Let's all sit down. Yes.
- Yes.

00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:23.700
(Seeking witnesses)

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:28.240
My apologies.

00:04:28.570 --> 00:04:30.510
I will make sure it's taken down
by the end of the day.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.980
Make sure there are no slip-ups this time.

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.550
And check for any security cameras
in the area.

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:38.150
- Yes, don't worry.
- They just won't quit.

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.350
That was so long ago.

00:04:40.890 --> 00:04:44.890
All this time has passed,
and they're still at it, causing a scene?

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.690
They're like weeds.

00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:51.530
You pull them out, you stomp on them,
but they stubbornly pop right back up.

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.530
Weeds,
determined to ruin my flower garden.

00:04:56.370 --> 00:04:58.570
That's why we have to rip them out
by the roots...

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:02.010
before they can even sprout.

00:05:23.900 --> 00:05:24.930
Why aren't you eating?

00:05:26.830 --> 00:05:30.230
I was just enjoying watching you eat.

00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:32.700
Kang Baek Ho,
have you been starving or something?

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.170
We've eaten together a million times,
but I've never seen you eat like this.

00:05:37.810 --> 00:05:39.380
You're not putting on a show
for Jang Mi, are you?

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:41.680
Tae Pyung,
why are you dragging me into this?

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:46.320
No, it's just that it's all so delicious,
I can't help but inhale it.

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:49.720
- Seriously, it's all so good! All of it!
- I know, right?

00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:53.960
Jang Mi and Suk Hee are fantastic cooks.

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:56.360
Here, have some more.

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.930
- Go on, eat up. All of it.
- I think I'm going to explode.

00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.830
But I just can't stop.

00:06:04.170 --> 00:06:06.170
Would you like me to get you some more?

00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.210
No, I'm good, thank you.

00:06:09.210 --> 00:06:13.210
But I have to say, Jang Mi,
your cooking is the best.

00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:15.410
My mom made the japchae.

00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:19.480
Japchae is my specialty.
Jung Suk Hee makes a mean japchae.

00:06:19.650 --> 00:06:20.690
Oh, really?

00:06:21.450 --> 00:06:24.060
But it seems like such a waste for me
to have all this to myself.

00:06:24.120 --> 00:06:25.420
Don't lay it on too thick.

00:06:25.790 --> 00:06:29.730
No, I'm serious.
I'd love to eat like this every day.

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:31.700
Come eat with us often.

00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:33.500
You're helping Tae Pyung with his work,

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:37.500
and you gave him that expensive guitar.
We already owe you so much.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:40.400
Then, I'll come by often
and buy some side dishes.

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.510
Okay.

00:06:41.610 --> 00:06:43.540
Jang Mi, that's okay with you, right?

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:47.450
Of course.
My brother already owes you so much.

00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.450
But I hurt my hand,
so it might be difficult for a while.

00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:54.720
Oh, right.

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:58.320
I swear, if I find the guy who did this
to Jang Mi's hand, he'll pay.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.300
You're right.

00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.370
Who was it that hurt your hand?

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:10.100
It happened while you were working
part-time at the hotel,

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.700
so was it someone who works there?

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:15.210
I already consulted Lawyer Kang about
beating the guy who hurt you to a pulp.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:18.180
Quickly talk it over with Lawyer Kang
and file a complaint.

00:07:18.810 --> 00:07:20.710
Oh, you think I should?

00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:26.220
Lawyer Kang, if you're finished eating,
let's have that consultation.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:28.990
Hey...

00:07:29.920 --> 00:07:30.920
What are you doing?

00:07:32.420 --> 00:07:34.330
- You okay?
- Yes.

00:07:35.630 --> 00:07:36.930
I said you didn't have to do it.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:41.030
Not at all.
You treated me to such a wonderful meal.

00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:42.330
The least I can do is wash the dishes.

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.370
I do a great job with the dishes
at home, too.

00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:48.670
Then, I'll let you
take care of it, Mr. Lawyer.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:51.340
As you can see, I've hurt my hand.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.480
Say no more.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.350
- Please, go have a seat.
- What?

00:07:56.410 --> 00:07:57.480
Dad, come on.

00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:01.920
I feel so bad making our guest do this.

00:08:02.790 --> 00:08:04.060
- Hey.
- What?

00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:07.020
- Hey, let's go.
- What?

00:08:07.090 --> 00:08:08.290
- Come on.
- Hey, wait a minute.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:10.130
- Get out here. Let's go.
- Hold on.

00:08:10.530 --> 00:08:11.530
Come on.

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:16.630
Hey, just let them be alone.
We should just pretend we don't notice.

00:08:16.700 --> 00:08:18.000
What do you mean, Dad?

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:20.140
He's our guest. It's his first time over.

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.210
Who makes their guest do the dishes?

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:26.310
You have to give a young man and woman
some time alone together.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.210
Didn't you see the look
Jang Mi gave us earlier?

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:31.080
- What?
- I think Jang Mi...

00:08:31.080 --> 00:08:33.890
has a thing for the lawyer.

00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:37.260
That's why she was practically
pushing us out of there.

00:08:37.390 --> 00:08:38.720
No way.

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:43.560
Lawyer Kang would be perfect for her.
I'm all for it.

00:08:43.730 --> 00:08:45.100
I'm for it, too.

00:08:49.100 --> 00:08:52.770
I only kept quiet
to save you the embarrassment.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:54.110
So you'd better appreciate it.

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.070
Okay, I appreciate it.

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:59.480
It's not that I'm looking for a thank you.

00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:01.150
So, what are you going to do about it?

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.720
- What do you mean?
- Unbelievable.

00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:07.890
After what you did to my hand,

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.920
are you just going to play innocent
and act as if you got away with it?

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.320
Are you trying to weasel
your way out of this?

00:09:13.390 --> 00:09:15.460
Hey, who says I'm doing that?

00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:17.460
But that's exactly how you're acting.

00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.330
What do you think my family will do
if they find out it was you who did this?

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:23.300
- Keep it down. They'll hear you.
- Hey! What are you doing?

00:09:30.010 --> 00:09:33.310
You really are a repeat offender,
aren't you?

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:35.280
Who said you could do that?

00:09:38.380 --> 00:09:40.420
Stop being a baby and get up.

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.090
Does that give you the right
to be so violent?

00:09:44.820 --> 00:09:47.160
I think I need to go to the hospital.

00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:52.430
I'm not even married yet!
Will you take responsibility?

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:53.900
What?

00:09:56.070 --> 00:09:57.170
What's going on?

00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:58.940
Did I just hear someone scream?

00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:02.510
What? A scream?
No, you didn't hear anything.

00:10:02.710 --> 00:10:04.910
Lawyer Kang, didn't hear someone scream?

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:06.810
No, I didn't hear a thing.

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:10.210
It's nothing.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:12.180
It's nothing.

00:10:31.940 --> 00:10:33.670
Hong Ju, that's enough. Stop crying.

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:35.810
You know the Chairman
has high blood pressure.

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:40.410
Chairman,
please don't mind what Hong Ju said.

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:43.710
It was an order from CEO Chae,
so it's not like we can just reverse it.

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:46.080
Don't you worry.

00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:49.490
I'll have a word with CEO Chae.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.660
I only reacted that way
because I thought you knew, Chairman.

00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:55.130
I'm sorry.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:58.660
You have so much on your plate already,
and I've just added to your worries.

00:11:12.510 --> 00:11:14.050
Here you go.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:20.580
How is it?

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.390
- Feeling a surge of energy?
- Yes.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:26.160
There's nothing better than this
for restoring your energy.

00:11:27.730 --> 00:11:28.930
Welcome home, ma'am.

00:11:29.330 --> 00:11:31.830
- I'm home, Father.
- You. Come and sit down.

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:34.970
If it isn't urgent,
I'll just go change and come back down.

00:11:35.030 --> 00:11:37.940
Are you trying to defy me?

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.040
No, sir.

00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.410
Seeing Assistant Manager Jin is here,

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:43.170
I assume this is about
the personnel transfer.

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:45.480
I will come down and explain
after I get changed.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.050
My goodness, CEO Chae.

00:11:51.980 --> 00:11:53.780
To think she'd defy the Chairman.

00:11:54.420 --> 00:11:56.750
She's certainly gotten bold.

00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:08.700
Time for a little something sweet,
isn't it?

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:11.100
What is this?

00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:14.670
Calculating sales gives you
the biggest dopamine rush, right?

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.670
You deserve a little reward,
like some ice cream.

00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:18.680
Here, have some.

00:12:22.710 --> 00:12:25.820
- I'm fine.
- You're such a stick-in-the-mud.

00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:30.420
Are you sure you'll beat
my mom's challenge to double the sales?

00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:35.460
I hope you don't get fired, Chef Kang.
I want you to stick around.

00:12:36.090 --> 00:12:38.160
I, Ma Seo Rin, am rooting for you.

00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:43.970
You're interrupting my work, so get out.

00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:47.300
Do I need to make a recording
of myself saying that?

00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:53.540
What do you think you're doing?

00:12:54.410 --> 00:12:56.580
I don't have hepatitis
or any other viruses.

00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:59.280
I even added my special flavor enhancer.
You're welcome, right?

00:13:01.590 --> 00:13:02.650
I'm warning you.

00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:05.220
Pull a stunt like that again,
and I won't forgive you.

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:07.890
You're just playing hard to get.
I know you liked it.

00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:11.700
You know, when a girl makes a move,
it's classy to just play along.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:16.430
- This woman, I swear...
- Okay. All right.

00:13:17.070 --> 00:13:18.270
I'll get out of your hair,

00:13:19.170 --> 00:13:20.600
so hurry and eat this before it melts.

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.410
Try all you want.
It's not going to work on me.

00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:35.220
What's this about transferring
Assistant Manager Jin...

00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:36.290
to the India branch?

00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:38.660
I don't understand...

00:13:39.160 --> 00:13:40.990
why you're so upset, Father.

00:13:40.990 --> 00:13:42.590
You don't understand?

00:13:43.290 --> 00:13:45.230
You know very well
why you're shipping off...

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.500
Assistant Manager Jin,
a good employee, to India.

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:49.130
And you say you don't understand?

00:13:49.970 --> 00:13:53.970
You're doing this to defy me
just because I brought up Mrs. Yeom.

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:57.040
Since when have you defied me like this?

00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.040
Father.

00:13:58.510 --> 00:14:00.740
Assistant Manager Jin's transfer is not
under my sole authority.

00:14:01.310 --> 00:14:03.680
And Father,
instead of being disappointed with me,

00:14:03.980 --> 00:14:06.880
you should be reprimanding
Assistant Manager Jin,

00:14:06.880 --> 00:14:08.220
who is sitting right outside.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:09.820
- What?
- Just look at...

00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:11.520
Assistant Manager Jin's behavior.

00:14:12.290 --> 00:14:14.930
We're a major corporation,
not some mom-and-pop shop.

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:18.000
She's defying a decision made
by the board and the CEO...

00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:21.030
and running to the Chairman to complain.

00:14:21.030 --> 00:14:22.730
Is that appropriate for an employee?

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:27.400
Would I want to have someone like that
working directly for me?

00:14:27.910 --> 00:14:29.170
CEO Chae!

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:32.340
So you're determined to get rid of
Assistant Manager Jin...

00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:33.910
by sending her to India?

00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:35.710
It's not about kicking her out, Father.

00:14:36.150 --> 00:14:39.650
These assignments are directly tied
to an employee's career path.

00:14:40.280 --> 00:14:43.220
And it wasn't just Assistant Manager Jin
who was transferred.

00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:44.890
So?

00:14:45.360 --> 00:14:50.030
Are you telling me you're going to defy me
and refuse to reverse the transfer order?

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:51.530
Reversing the transfer order...

00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.370
could have a negative impact
on the company.

00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:57.430
If we issue a transfer
and then immediately rescind it,

00:14:57.740 --> 00:14:59.940
how could our employees possibly
trust the company?

00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.370
- What now?
- It would confuse our employees,

00:15:03.710 --> 00:15:07.980
and it could lower their morale
and loyalty to the organization.

00:15:08.980 --> 00:15:11.120
We'd just be shooting ourselves
in the foot.

00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.890
Father, please reconsider.

00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.330
CEO Chae, how could you?

00:15:23.390 --> 00:15:26.360
I've given up my days off
and worked around the clock,

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:29.030
and you know how hard I've worked
for this company.

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:30.270
Where are your manners?

00:15:30.730 --> 00:15:32.240
Have you no class,
listening in on a private conversation?

00:15:32.800 --> 00:15:35.470
Yeom San Wol,
is this how you raised your daughter?

00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:38.880
No, it's just...

00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:43.910
I'm so sorry, Chairman.
She was just so distraught.

00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.550
But, CEO Chae,
Hong Ju never even took a day off.

00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:50.120
I can guarantee you,
she lives and breathes for her job.

00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.820
You have no idea how hard
Hong Ju has worked.

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:54.490
That's what we pay her for.

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:56.690
As if she did something so extraordinary.

00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:05.470
Father, I know
how fond you are of Assistant Manager Jin.

00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.640
I feel the same way, as does the board.

00:16:08.010 --> 00:16:10.670
This decision was made out of
our deep appreciation for her.

00:16:11.080 --> 00:16:14.080
Two years will fly by,
and it will be a great experience for her.

00:16:14.650 --> 00:16:16.380
We made this decision
with her long-term career in mind,

00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:17.880
so please try to understand.

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:22.620
If you'll excuse me.

00:16:28.590 --> 00:16:30.330
CEO Chae.

00:16:37.270 --> 00:16:40.300
CEO Chae, please, I'm begging you.
Spare Hong Ju just this once.

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:41.870
Please?

00:16:43.610 --> 00:16:45.540
- And how exactly should I spare her?
- What?

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:49.650
Come on, you know exactly what I mean.

00:16:49.950 --> 00:16:53.480
Hong Ju isn't strong.
She can't work in a place so far away.

00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:54.590
You know that, don't you?

00:16:55.750 --> 00:16:57.390
CEO Chae, please, I'm begging you.

00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:59.690
San Wol. What did I tell you?

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:03.360
- Yes?
- I told you to never come here again...

00:17:03.630 --> 00:17:05.760
and to stay away from the Chairman.
I believe I made that clear.

00:17:06.100 --> 00:17:07.100
Well...

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:09.400
- You did.
- And yet?

00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:12.770
Fine.

00:17:13.270 --> 00:17:15.040
So, as punishment for that,

00:17:15.370 --> 00:17:19.280
you're exiling Hong Ju
to some faraway land.

00:17:19.710 --> 00:17:21.650
But don't you have a heart?

00:17:21.780 --> 00:17:24.150
Doesn't everyone deserve a second chance?

00:17:24.450 --> 00:17:26.650
You're supposed to
forgive a first mistake.

00:17:26.880 --> 00:17:29.850
A mistake? You call that a mistake?

00:17:30.120 --> 00:17:31.890
Was getting close to the Chairman
a mistake?

00:17:32.190 --> 00:17:34.460
Want me to record that
and play it for him?

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:37.960
You know that's not what I meant.
Why are you doing this?

00:17:38.060 --> 00:17:40.960
Shut up. You should know better.
What are you playing at?

00:17:41.170 --> 00:17:44.370
Do you think this is a joke?
Don't you get it the first time?

00:17:45.270 --> 00:17:47.640
- Hwa Young.
- I made it crystal clear...

00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:49.140
you were to stay away from the Chairman.

00:17:49.210 --> 00:17:51.340
But you completely ignored me,

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:54.380
and while here asking for a favor,
you were seducing him?

00:17:54.580 --> 00:17:56.780
And you have the gall
to call that a mistake?

00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:00.050
I was wrong.

00:18:00.650 --> 00:18:01.950
Wrong about what, exactly?

00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:07.520
If you just put Hong Ju back
where she belongs,

00:18:07.590 --> 00:18:09.530
I'll never...

00:18:10.090 --> 00:18:12.460
go anywhere near the Chairman again.

00:18:13.030 --> 00:18:14.630
I mean it this time.

00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:16.530
Do you think...

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:20.100
I'd choose my love over my own daughter?

00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:23.370
"Love?"

00:18:23.710 --> 00:18:25.340
Did you just say "love"
with that filthy mouth of yours?

00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:27.710
Say it again. I dare you.

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:29.850
You "love" the Chairman?

00:18:32.650 --> 00:18:34.490
That's right. Love.

00:18:35.120 --> 00:18:36.620
I love the Chairman.

00:18:37.090 --> 00:18:38.090
That's enough!

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:40.420
Chairman.

00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:42.090
Chairman...

00:18:43.190 --> 00:18:44.230
Yes.

00:19:00.810 --> 00:19:03.780
Honey, is something on your mind lately?

00:19:23.630 --> 00:19:24.670
Honey.

00:19:24.940 --> 00:19:25.940
Yes?

00:19:26.340 --> 00:19:28.410
Did you say something?

00:19:28.410 --> 00:19:30.310
I asked if something was on your mind.

00:19:30.570 --> 00:19:33.080
Why are you so spaced out?
What could you be thinking about?

00:19:33.410 --> 00:19:34.650
What's going on with you lately?

00:19:35.910 --> 00:19:37.510
It's nothing.

00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:39.980
It's just a seasonal thing.

00:19:55.400 --> 00:19:58.040
The Professor was here by himself
a few days ago, too.

00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.960
The house feels so empty without the kids.

00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:26.500
They'll be getting married
and moving out before we know it.

00:20:26.930 --> 00:20:29.130
What will we do then?

00:20:30.430 --> 00:20:33.500
What do you mean? We'll just go on living,
the way we always have.

00:20:36.540 --> 00:20:40.010
By the way, I heard
a philharmonic orchestra was coming.

00:20:40.110 --> 00:20:42.010
Honey, we should go.

00:20:43.510 --> 00:20:45.920
Okay, I'll look into getting tickets.

00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:53.920
CEO Chae is here.

00:20:55.830 --> 00:20:57.630
I'm just going to step out for one minute.

00:20:58.230 --> 00:20:59.400
Where are you going at this hour?

00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.130
I just need some fresh air.
I feel suffocated.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:09.310
What's gotten into him?

00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:41.910
Wait, you got a job here?

00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:43.470
Yes.

00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:47.540
You have to start small to make it big.

00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.680
CEO Chae.

00:22:25.220 --> 00:22:26.220
What?

00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:30.050
Professor.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.960
You've had a lot to drink.
You should stop now.

00:22:36.590 --> 00:22:39.230
Are you worried about me?

00:22:40.660 --> 00:22:43.630
The only person in this whole world
who worries about me...

00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:45.540
is you, Professor.

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:47.840
Did something happen?

00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:50.940
You seem to be drinking more than usual,
CEO Chae.

00:22:51.510 --> 00:22:53.240
There's always something with work.

00:22:54.810 --> 00:22:56.850
Today, I was just so unbearably lonely...

00:22:57.710 --> 00:23:00.280
that I was about to ask
the next person I saw...

00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:01.550
to be my drinking buddy.

00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:07.060
Thank you for appearing
like my Prince Charming.

00:23:15.330 --> 00:23:16.630
Why is it, Professor,

00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:19.340
that whenever I'm at my most desperate,

00:23:19.840 --> 00:23:21.510
you always show up right on time?

00:23:25.640 --> 00:23:27.340
See? You really are like a prince.

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:31.580
Here to save Sleeping Beauty?

00:23:32.650 --> 00:23:33.680
That's right.

00:23:45.060 --> 00:23:46.860
If you kiss me on the lips,

00:23:48.700 --> 00:23:50.470
I'll finally awaken from my slumber.

00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:53.170
And after that,

00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:56.710
what happens next in the story?

00:24:12.660 --> 00:24:14.830
Hello, I'm Oh Tae Pyung.

00:24:15.690 --> 00:24:16.990
I've heard about you.

00:24:24.230 --> 00:24:27.840
We have a lot of regulars here.
So an outfit like that...

00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:31.040
We're honored to be here.

00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:34.180
We just came to introduce ourselves
to you today.

00:24:34.580 --> 00:24:36.780
Starting tomorrow,
we'll be dressed to impress.

00:24:37.810 --> 00:24:39.050
Is he your manager?

00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:40.320
Pardon?

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:43.590
Yes. He's my manager.

00:24:44.750 --> 00:24:46.290
Give me a break.

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:48.120
I heard this will be
your first time on stage.

00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:52.200
You start from the bottom
and work your way up.

00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.560
Got it?

00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:55.170
Yes, sir!

00:24:57.000 --> 00:24:58.000
Yes, sir!

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:16.090
All right.

00:25:19.390 --> 00:25:20.390
Jang Mi,

00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:23.860
what did you think about
what Lawyer Kang suggested earlier?

00:25:27.160 --> 00:25:29.070
With side dishes this delicious,

00:25:29.430 --> 00:25:32.700
I feel like just selling them on their own
is a missed opportunity.

00:25:33.170 --> 00:25:34.940
- A business opportunity?
- Yes.

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:37.140
We order meal deliveries at work,

00:25:37.410 --> 00:25:39.580
but they're loaded with artificial flavors
and don't taste so great.

00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.110
Half the time, I'm not even sure
if I should be eating it.

00:25:42.550 --> 00:25:46.980
If you started a boxed lunch delivery,
I think it would be a massive hit.

00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:48.590
Boxed lunch delivery?

00:25:49.750 --> 00:25:52.120
Dad, I'm all for it.

00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:54.460
He even said he'd take care of...

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:57.360
the permits, health department,
and all the legal stuff.

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:59.130
But that'll be tough. Will you be okay?

00:25:59.900 --> 00:26:02.270
Of course. I've got your stamina, don't I?

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:04.670
Right.

00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:08.610
Let's save up quickly
so you can study abroad.

00:26:09.410 --> 00:26:10.970
I promise I'll do whatever it takes
to support you.

00:26:11.470 --> 00:26:13.340
Let's just work a little harder, okay?

00:26:13.340 --> 00:26:14.640
It's not hard work.

00:26:15.180 --> 00:26:17.350
I love doing this, Dad.

00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:23.490
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:26.660
Yes.

00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:28.530
Again?

00:26:34.970 --> 00:26:36.700
Is that really true?

00:26:37.370 --> 00:26:40.670
How did this happen?
Yes, I understand. Okay.

00:26:42.110 --> 00:26:43.110
Dad?

00:26:44.470 --> 00:26:45.610
Gosh, look.

00:26:48.280 --> 00:26:49.280
This...

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:50.980
What's going on?

00:26:51.610 --> 00:26:53.250
The banner's gone again?

00:26:53.250 --> 00:26:55.750
Yes. I'm positive about this now.

00:26:56.150 --> 00:26:58.790
I'm positive it's the work of the jerks
who did that to your mother.

00:27:21.610 --> 00:27:23.080
(The First Man)

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:25.480
Maybe the culprit is still living
around Taean.

00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.280
Should we put the banner back up?

00:27:27.720 --> 00:27:28.720
How about this?

00:27:28.720 --> 00:27:29.850
You're resigning?

00:27:29.850 --> 00:27:31.720
You're leaving Dream Hotel...

00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:33.920
to be unemployed and live with your mom?

00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:35.860
I don't know. We'll have to wait and see.

00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:40.160
A singer I back is performing here today,
and he insisted that I come.

00:27:40.330 --> 00:27:42.900
When he starts singing, make sure you clap
really loud for him, okay?

00:27:48.340 --> 00:27:50.340
