(Episode 8)

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:04.740
Right. Yes.

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:06.710
Understood.

00:00:08.180 --> 00:00:09.180
Yes. Right.

(Dream Group Negotiating
One Billion-dollar Investment...)

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.320
Thankfully, it seems Seo Rin's photo
was well blocked in the articles.

00:00:16.520 --> 00:00:18.290
- Yes.
- What?

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:21.360
Of course. Okay.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:23.830
Okay. Yes. Right. I get it.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.230
Mom, hang on.

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.970
What? Bring my resume?

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:30.970
Okay, got it.

00:00:50.320 --> 00:00:51.320
Stop the car!

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:55.130
That woman! That's Jung Suk Hee!

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.060
She's pregnant too?

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:00.270
All right, Jung Suk Hee.

00:01:01.230 --> 00:01:02.930
This is where you live, is it?

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:04.770
You just wait.

00:01:10.710 --> 00:01:13.450
I'm afraid the baby had
already passed away.

00:01:13.480 --> 00:01:16.510
Bring my son back! Bring him back!

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.950
I lost my baby because of you.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.120
All because of you.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:24.020
Jung Suk Hee?

00:01:56.650 --> 00:01:57.960
Mom!

00:01:58.360 --> 00:02:01.690
Hey, that's dangerous. What are you doing?
Let's go. I have to get somewhere.

00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:02.960
Excuse us!

(CEO's Office)

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:28.290
What was that?

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:31.560
Was that really Jung Suk Hee?

00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:36.190
No! Give me back my baby! No!

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:40.570
Please give my babies back.
Please don't do this!

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.370
Did she run at me because
she recognized me?

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.540
If so, after I took her child,
why has she stayed quiet all this time?

00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:51.340
Even though she knows exactly who I am...

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:54.180
What on earth is going on?

00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:00.120
Right. It must be someone else.

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:04.160
If it's truly Jung Suk Hee, there's no way
she would've stayed quiet until now.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:06.460
It's been so many years.

00:03:06.990 --> 00:03:08.990
How could I possibly recognize her now?

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:11.300
No. It can't be.

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:13.260
Right. It was some other woman.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:16.370
Right.

00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:18.370
Still, just in case...

00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:20.570
I have to make sure.

00:03:24.010 --> 00:03:25.010
President Hwang.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:27.950
I told you to produce his album.
What's the problem?

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:29.810
I already said I'm paying for it.

00:03:31.220 --> 00:03:32.220
All of a sudden?

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:35.150
I just don't get it.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.960
Just the other day
you were calling his singing noise.

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.230
- What's with the sudden change of heart?
- On second thought,

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:44.400
I think we could use it as a jingle
for our hotel on the cheap.

00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.210
Oh Tae Pyung, reporting for duty!
I came as fast as I could.

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.340
How come you're alone today?
Where's your legal counsel?

00:03:57.410 --> 00:04:00.080
I got the call so suddenly
that I just rushed right over.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.650
Lawyer Kang is probably
at the courthouse right about now.

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.580
- You mean your friend is a real lawyer?
- Yes, of course.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.050
Didn't Lawyer Kang give you
his business card?

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.860
A lawyer, of all people...

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:15.260
He's my friend, but Baek Ho
is just a huge busybody.

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.900
He even gives free legal advice to seniors
at the community center sometimes.

00:04:24.870 --> 00:04:26.600
Civil Code, Article 826.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:30.010
Despite the legal duty of a married couple
to cooperate in maintaining the household,

00:04:30.410 --> 00:04:32.780
throughout this marriage,
the defendant took it for granted...

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.180
that the plaintiff alone would handle
most of the housework and childcare.

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.220
Do you have a rebuttal?

00:04:38.950 --> 00:04:40.150
Your Honor.

00:04:40.850 --> 00:04:44.290
My client was handling
an overwhelming workload,

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:47.560
and we admit he did not
participate enough in the home.

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:48.830
However, that in itself...

00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:51.760
can hardly be considered
grounds for divorce.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:54.730
A marital relationship
is a matter to be resolved...

00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:56.400
through mutual understanding
and cooperation, correct?

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.140
Did you just say "mutual
understanding and cooperation?"

00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.210
My client, while undergoing treatment,
tried to discuss improving the situation,

00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.540
didn't the defendant refuse
to address the problem?

00:05:06.410 --> 00:05:07.410
Here are the relevant documents.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:15.150
I don't think you have
anything to worry about.

00:05:20.590 --> 00:05:21.590
Oh my!

00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:26.460
What am I going to do? What do I do?

00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:31.140
Jang Mi, what's the matter?

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:35.610
That's our little bunny's bathtub.
The little bunny loves it.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:37.280
The little bunny takes a bath in it.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:41.480
Gosh, Mom, this isn't even mine!

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:44.720
Oh, dear. Our Jung Suk Hee
has really outdone herself.

00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.690
- Wasn't this Tae Pyung's?
- No. It belongs to some jerk...

00:05:51.420 --> 00:05:52.420
No, it's not.

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:54.390
Dad, don't worry about it.

00:05:56.430 --> 00:06:01.300
He's going to flip out when he finds out
what happened to his guitar. What do I do?

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.600
Gosh.

00:06:09.710 --> 00:06:14.110
(Lawyer Kang Baek Ho)

00:06:14.380 --> 00:06:17.080
What? I wonder what's up with Tae Pyung.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.120
What? You're really going to
give me an album deal?

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:23.860
I am.

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.760
But there are a few things
I need to review first.

00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.930
- Yes, whatever you need!
- Did you bring your resume?

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:31.000
Of course.

00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:33.200
President Hwang asked me
to bring a resume,

00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.700
so I whipped one up right away.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.570
But do I really need a resume
to release an album?

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.910
(Oh Tae Pyung, Education, Military,
Language Skills, Work Experience)

00:06:48.450 --> 00:06:50.350
Why is your family information missing
from your resume?

00:06:50.680 --> 00:06:52.850
Pardon? My family information?

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.590
My family...

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:01.430
I have my parents, a married older sister,
and a younger sister.

00:07:02.530 --> 00:07:03.590
Really?

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:04.630
That's odd.

00:07:04.930 --> 00:07:08.300
I could have sworn he called the woman
he was with, Jung Suk Hee, "Mom."

00:07:09.130 --> 00:07:11.000
Or was that not Jung Suk Hee?

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.540
My family absolutely loves my singing.

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:19.310
If I make an album,
they'll promote the heck out of it.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:24.480
I'll need to test your voice again,
so next time you come,

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:29.050
- bring your family relation certificate.
- My what?

00:07:29.550 --> 00:07:31.960
Okay, I will.

00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:36.660
Don't forget.
The family relations certificate.

00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:52.880
Director Ma, you're in again today.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:59.020
- Are you disappointed to see me here?
- Goodness, no. I'm just happy to see you.

00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.590
This is the first time in almost a year
that you've come in every day.

00:08:03.350 --> 00:08:05.390
Are you getting lunch?
Can I order you something?

00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:07.330
What are you doing here,
Assistant Manager Jin?

00:08:07.930 --> 00:08:09.790
I'm here for the new restaurant
that's opening soon.

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:11.830
I came to check on its progress.

00:08:12.330 --> 00:08:13.400
But Director Ma,

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.530
what on earth brings you here?

00:08:17.970 --> 00:08:18.970
Assistant Manager Jin.

00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:21.870
You're here to "check on the progress,"
you said?

00:08:22.210 --> 00:08:23.710
If that's what you're doing,

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:25.210
then so am I.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:28.250
Stop acting like only you work here.
It's obnoxious.

00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:29.980
What? Obnoxious?

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:31.720
The nerve of her!

00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.660
And here I thought you just came to eat.
By all means, get to work.

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:38.920
Don't let me stop you.

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.320
Hey.

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:42.660
We have a new head chef, don't we?

00:08:43.190 --> 00:08:44.200
Get him in here.

00:08:45.130 --> 00:08:46.900
Chef Kang Jun Ho? Why do you need him?

00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:57.110
I'm Kang Jun Ho.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:00.040
Assistant Manager Jin,
you can go back to work.

00:09:00.380 --> 00:09:02.650
I'm sure things are piling up
in the Food and Beverage office.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.430
Obnoxious? Look who's talking.

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:34.150
(Director of Food and Beverage,
Ma Seo Rin)

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:44.890
- Sit down. I don't bite.
- Are you always this crass?

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:47.190
Yes. This is me.

00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.560
Chef Kang Jun Ho, what do you recommend?

00:09:50.900 --> 00:09:54.470
What's the one dish
this restaurant is most proud of?

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.670
We're not open yet,
so we're not fully prepared,

00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:02.540
but I can make you a dish
you'll never forget.

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:03.840
Is that so?

00:10:05.810 --> 00:10:07.850
After all that hype,

00:10:08.610 --> 00:10:09.610
what are you going to do if it's bad?

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:12.350
There's no chance of that.

00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.390
Just brimming with confidence, aren't you?

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.060
All right. I'll be waiting.

00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:21.690
One more thing.

00:10:23.290 --> 00:10:26.800
If this tastes bad,
you have to go out with me. Deal?

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:33.570
And if it's good,
don't you ever say that to me again.

00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:36.110
Do I look like a joke to you?

00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:39.040
Wow.

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:43.050
Bravo!

00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:45.980
Chef Kang Jun Ho,
I like you even more now.

00:10:57.630 --> 00:10:58.630
Okay.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:01.900
Really?

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:04.470
So you're saying Director Ma said that?

00:11:10.710 --> 00:11:12.810
Gosh, what's taking her so long?

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:20.320
Hey, Tae Pyung.

00:11:21.690 --> 00:11:22.690
Really?

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:24.690
They're going to help you
release an album?

00:11:24.690 --> 00:11:26.220
Yes, I'm telling you, it's for real.

00:11:26.790 --> 00:11:28.560
I can't tell if I'm dreaming or not.

00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:31.200
It looks like you're finally
about to spread your wings.

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:32.900
Man, that's awesome.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:40.470
Hey, come by my office later
to practice your singing, all right?

00:11:40.540 --> 00:11:42.610
Singing? Is he an aspiring singer?

00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:46.440
He'll flip when he sees the broken guitar.
What do I do?

00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:48.850
All right. Come by later.

00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:52.420
When did you get here?

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.120
Just now.

00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.790
You seem to be in a good mood.

00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:01.230
Something good happened
to a friend of mine...

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:02.490
Anyway!

00:12:04.130 --> 00:12:06.000
Don't go prying into
other people's business.

00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:07.700
Here.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:12.140
Who said I wanted to know?
I couldn't care less, actually.

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:14.140
Just look inside.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:17.370
I bought the exact same one you did.

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:21.810
- You bought it?
- Don't look at me like that.

00:12:22.850 --> 00:12:23.850
The thing is,

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:27.350
my mom wore it,
thinking I'd bought it for her.

00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:29.890
A likely story.

00:12:36.130 --> 00:12:37.700
Now, can I have my guitar back?

00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:41.770
Right.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:45.100
The thing is...

00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:46.140
Wait.

00:12:47.570 --> 00:12:48.570
First...

00:12:49.010 --> 00:12:51.910
- I have a confession to make.
- A confession?

00:12:53.880 --> 00:12:55.150
What is with you?

00:12:56.350 --> 00:13:00.150
- It's just that...
- What?

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:01.820
- It's just...
- What is it?

00:13:03.250 --> 00:13:04.360
Unbelievable.

00:13:05.290 --> 00:13:07.020
Don't tell me you've fallen for me.

00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.030
Is that the confession
you're trying to make?

00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:10.430
What did you just say?

00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:13.360
I can't believe this guy.

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:15.900
You've got to be kidding me.

00:13:16.870 --> 00:13:19.340
I came here to be humble
because I messed up,

00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:21.140
but I just can't stand this.

00:13:21.610 --> 00:13:25.080
- Messed up?
- Yes, I have something to tell you!

00:13:29.310 --> 00:13:31.150
The guitar...

00:13:39.290 --> 00:13:40.320
I'm so sorry.

00:13:40.690 --> 00:13:43.630
- Here's what happened...
- My angel.

00:13:44.090 --> 00:13:45.730
What happened to my angel?

00:13:46.030 --> 00:13:47.030
Hey!

00:13:55.140 --> 00:13:58.210
I polished it really well.

00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:04.480
You can probably still play it
if you just change the strings.

00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:06.680
Look.

00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.520
You think "sorry" fixes everything?

00:14:09.290 --> 00:14:11.860
If you killed someone,
would saying "sorry" be the end of it?

00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:15.730
How can you compare a broken guitar
to someone dying?

00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:19.300
I already said I was sorry.
If someone apologizes,

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:22.330
you should have the decency to accept it.
A man shouldn't be so petty.

00:14:22.400 --> 00:14:24.400
Why are you freaking out
over some stupid guitar?

00:14:24.470 --> 00:14:27.540
You're the one in the wrong.
How dare you yell at me?

00:14:27.610 --> 00:14:31.110
I'm yelling because you won't accept it!
What else do you want from me?

00:14:31.180 --> 00:14:32.210
Unbelievable.

00:14:32.880 --> 00:14:36.210
If you hadn't taken my mom's shopping bag
in the first place,

00:14:36.310 --> 00:14:37.450
none of this would've happened.

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:41.690
Hey. You're the one who shared my cab.

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:44.290
You got off first
and took my shopping bag.

00:14:44.360 --> 00:14:46.660
And you're the one
who just up and stole my guitar.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.790
Stole? Why are you calling me a thief?
This is ridiculous.

00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.060
Here.

00:14:54.770 --> 00:14:57.840
This should be enough for new strings,
and then some.

00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:06.780
Do you have any idea
how much this guitar costs?

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:09.780
You can't even buy this model
in the country.

00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:11.720
Here, take a look.

00:15:11.950 --> 00:15:13.920
See if this chump change
even begins to cover it.

00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:20.360
Ones, tens, hundreds...

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:22.630
Wait, 3,000 dollars?

00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:24.530
What kind of a guitar costs
over 3,000 dollars?

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.000
My angel was handmade by a master luthier.

00:15:28.070 --> 00:15:32.340
Wait, don't tell me
you expect me to pay for the whole thing.

00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.440
Of course.

00:15:33.700 --> 00:15:36.210
Why would you take a perfectly fine guitar
and wreck it like this?

00:15:36.270 --> 00:15:37.270
But...

00:15:37.780 --> 00:15:41.080
That's not fair.
It's clearly a used guitar.

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:45.520
Do you know the price difference
between a brand new car and a used one?

00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:49.690
So you think this covers
the resale value of my guitar?

00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:51.660
This guitar...

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.760
belongs to someone debuting soon.

00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:55.790
Did you ask why
I made the comparison to someone dying?

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:58.860
This guitar is as important to me
as my own life right now.

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:03.030
Then what am I supposed to do?

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:06.270
What, you want me to
bring it back from the dead?

00:16:06.570 --> 00:16:07.670
You're the one who said it was dead.

00:16:07.740 --> 00:16:09.470
Are you seriously joking around
with me right now?

00:16:11.510 --> 00:16:15.810
- I'm just frustrated, okay?
- Settle in court, or do I press charges?

00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.650
- What is that supposed to mean?
- I'll handle the details.

00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:20.980
I'll see you in court.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:23.820
What? No, wait!

00:16:24.890 --> 00:16:26.460
I'll be in touch. So you just wait.

00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.290
Hold on...

00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:33.700
What the...

00:16:47.850 --> 00:16:50.150
- Father, I'm home.
- Yes.

00:16:50.150 --> 00:16:52.750
San Wol, you make yourself
right at home, don't you?

00:16:54.550 --> 00:16:56.050
What brings you here this time?

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:59.720
The flowers were just so lovely,
I just had to buy some.

00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.460
You like these flowers too, don't you?

00:17:02.060 --> 00:17:03.590
They really liven up the place, you know.

00:17:04.330 --> 00:17:08.230
- Don't you think so, Chairman?
- Yes, they're not bad.

00:17:08.870 --> 00:17:11.140
Has Seo Rin come home yet?

00:17:11.470 --> 00:17:13.440
You knew about it too?

00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:15.670
- I'm sorry?
- I hear...

00:17:16.110 --> 00:17:18.240
Seo Rin likes the chef
at Chang Restaurant.

00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:19.280
Pardon?

00:17:19.610 --> 00:17:20.740
What do you mean?

00:17:22.110 --> 00:17:24.480
The rumor's already all over the company.

00:17:24.550 --> 00:17:27.680
That's ridiculous.
When would Seo Rin have met Chef Kang,

00:17:27.750 --> 00:17:29.050
let alone develop a crush so quickly?

00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:31.390
That's not true, Father. It can't be.

00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:34.590
This is just a malicious rumor
to drag our Seo Rin down.

00:17:34.690 --> 00:17:38.000
We'll find out
when we ask Seo Rin herself.

00:17:49.570 --> 00:17:50.570
Oh my.

00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:02.450
Gosh, this is awful.

00:18:08.890 --> 00:18:10.260
That completely ruined my appetite.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:12.360
Chef Kang Jun Ho.

00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:16.230
Since this is terrible too,
you have to go out with me now. Got it?

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:19.140
Then why did you clean your plate
like you were enjoying it so much?

00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:22.240
You couldn't help it.
It was so delicious it went right down.

00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:26.880
If the customer says it's bad,
then it's bad.

00:18:36.150 --> 00:18:41.060
- Dad, I'm sorry you had to work alone.
- Not at all. You have perfect timing.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:44.530
Mind the store for a bit.
I'll go make a delivery.

00:18:44.930 --> 00:18:47.830
Where to? I'll take it.
Dad, you should get some rest.

00:18:48.970 --> 00:18:50.000
Would you?

00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:54.040
It's so busy, but I wonder
where your brother is, slacking off.

00:18:54.270 --> 00:18:57.040
Good grief. That kid is
completely useless.

00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.040
Here.

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.880
- Where's the delivery to?
- The fruit stand.

00:19:01.680 --> 00:19:05.780
- I'll just zip over on the scooter.
- I'm coming with you, Jang Mi.

00:19:06.780 --> 00:19:08.520
Mom, you just want a ride
on the scooter, don't you?

00:19:08.620 --> 00:19:11.290
Yes, riding behind you is fun.

00:19:11.890 --> 00:19:14.660
Your mom gets stir-crazy
being cooped up at home all the time.

00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.430
Let her get some fresh air.

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:20.600
- Drive safe.
- Okay. Let's go, Mom.

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.500
- This is exciting! Let's go.
- We'll be back.

00:19:22.570 --> 00:19:24.840
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:19:28.210 --> 00:19:29.510
Mom, we're here.

00:19:31.170 --> 00:19:32.180
There we go.

00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:37.810
- Let's go.
- Okay.

00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:42.090
Mom, wait right here. I'll be quick, okay?

00:19:42.920 --> 00:19:43.920
Jang Mi.

00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:46.220
My head is ringing.

00:19:47.260 --> 00:19:50.430
That's because you keep
tapping your head like that.

00:19:51.630 --> 00:19:54.130
- I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

00:19:55.570 --> 00:19:56.730
Hello.

00:19:57.130 --> 00:20:00.070
Having a busy day?
I'm here with your side dish delivery.

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:02.370
I asked for Mr. Oh to make the delivery,

00:20:02.670 --> 00:20:05.740
so why did you show up?
I wanted to see Mr. Oh.

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:09.350
Excuse me?
You're being really inappropriate.

00:20:09.650 --> 00:20:11.210
Why do you keep acting this way
toward my dad?

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:14.250
What do you mean, "why?"
Do you need a reason to like someone?

00:20:14.590 --> 00:20:17.550
I'm trying to make a move on your dad,
but he's not taking the bait.

00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:20.120
What did you just say?

00:20:20.790 --> 00:20:23.730
My father is a married man.

00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:26.430
And you're trying to seduce a married man?

00:20:27.360 --> 00:20:30.800
A wife? You call your mother,
who's clearly not all there, a wife?

00:20:31.540 --> 00:20:35.970
- She can't even act like a proper wife.
- Watch your mouth.

00:20:37.170 --> 00:20:38.210
Am I wrong?

00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:42.250
Let's be honest here.
If you really cared about your father,

00:20:42.310 --> 00:20:44.110
you wouldn't let him live
with that half-wit of a mother.

00:20:44.750 --> 00:20:48.520
You'd let him be with a vibrant woman.
You're just being a bad daughter.

00:20:48.590 --> 00:20:49.590
Ma'am!

00:20:50.220 --> 00:20:53.960
Don't you dare talk like that.
My mom is not a half-wit.

00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.490
- Unbelievable.
- "Nothing wrong with her," my foot.

00:20:56.960 --> 00:20:58.530
That burdensome half-wit.

00:21:01.230 --> 00:21:02.230
Ma'am!

00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:06.570
Stop calling her a half-wit.
You can't talk about people that way.

00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:07.840
It's not like my mom...

00:21:08.770 --> 00:21:10.370
Do you think she wanted
to end up like that?

00:21:10.470 --> 00:21:12.280
How dare you stare me down
and talk back to me!

00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:16.050
What if you get in a car accident
tomorrow and become a half-wit?

00:21:16.110 --> 00:21:17.980
Or end up in a vegetative state?
You never know.

00:21:18.050 --> 00:21:21.020
What? How dare you jinx me like that!

00:21:22.450 --> 00:21:23.490
Unbelievable.

00:21:24.020 --> 00:21:25.420
- This little brat...
- Jang Mi.

00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:27.520
Jang Mi.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:30.560
Mom.

00:21:31.260 --> 00:21:33.460
Mom, stop!

00:21:33.530 --> 00:21:35.400
Stop it, Mom.

00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:36.970
- Hey!
- Are you okay?

00:21:36.970 --> 00:21:40.700
- It's okay.
- Blood!

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:43.240
Darn it. Are you both nuts?

00:21:44.510 --> 00:21:46.940
I can't even get a grip on her
with this helmet on.

00:21:47.580 --> 00:21:49.510
You brat! Jang Mi, get over here.

00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:53.180
Let me go! You're the one who's crazy!

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:57.190
- Get over here!
- Apologize to her! What did my mom do?

00:21:57.250 --> 00:21:58.860
Does she look normal to you?

00:21:59.390 --> 00:22:03.290
Look at this pair of crazies,
acting like total idiots.

00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:06.130
I told you. You're the one who's crazy.

00:22:06.730 --> 00:22:10.300
How dare you try to seduce a married man?
If that's not crazy, what is?

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:12.300
Let go of my Jang Mi.

00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:15.640
Let go!

00:22:17.910 --> 00:22:19.980
- Mom, stop it.
- Let go!

00:22:23.650 --> 00:22:27.020
What? She asked
for your family relation certificate?

00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:30.090
Yes. Why would that be necessary
for releasing an album?

00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:31.420
Beats me.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:35.130
Maybe it's not about an album.
You think she's trying to hire you?

00:22:35.390 --> 00:22:36.460
Really?

00:22:37.730 --> 00:22:39.030
(Younger Sister)

00:22:40.330 --> 00:22:42.500
Tae Pyung, is it
from the pretty little sister of yours?

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:45.870
Hey, come on.
I told you, don't even think about it.

00:22:48.610 --> 00:22:49.910
Hey, Jang Mi.

00:22:50.070 --> 00:22:53.980
Jang Mi? Hey, that's a pretty name.
Come on, introduce us already.

00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:57.080
What? Is Mom at it again?

00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:10.760
Officer, you know Suk Hee.
She wouldn't do this on purpose.

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:13.900
You should try to settle with the victim,
not me.

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:20.040
Ms. Kim, are you badly hurt?

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:25.380
I don't know how a simpleton is so strong.
She just kept headbutting me.

00:23:25.880 --> 00:23:26.980
Mr. Oh,

00:23:27.580 --> 00:23:29.480
I'm bruised and aching all over.

00:23:30.810 --> 00:23:34.480
Listen here, lady.
You keep saying she's a simpleton.

00:23:34.580 --> 00:23:38.290
I told you, you never know.
An accident could do the same to you.

00:23:38.360 --> 00:23:40.190
Keep talking like that
and you'll get what's coming to you.

00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:42.230
Why do you keep saying such awful things?
You're jinxing me.

00:23:42.290 --> 00:23:44.530
You have to be nice to be treated nicely.

00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.800
This lady here is the one
who started saying horrible things!

00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:50.970
How dare you talk back?
Is that how you speak to your elders?

00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:53.240
Don't you yell at my Jang Mi!

00:23:54.270 --> 00:23:58.110
You're a bad lady. A bad person.
I'll punish the bad person.

00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:01.980
Oh my, look at her.
That half-wit is really putting on a show.

00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:03.750
- The whole family's nuts.
- Ms. Kim!

00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.320
Watch your mouth.

00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:09.150
What did I do wrong?

00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:11.090
Apologize to my Suk Hee.

00:24:11.090 --> 00:24:14.220
She's just unwell because of an accident.

00:24:14.290 --> 00:24:17.390
Apologize, or I'll sue you for defamation.
It's your choice.

00:24:17.530 --> 00:24:20.230
You all saw that, didn't you?
Right? You're all witnesses.

00:24:20.300 --> 00:24:23.900
No, wait, when did I ever slander her?

00:24:24.070 --> 00:24:25.100
Gosh...

00:24:25.100 --> 00:24:26.200
Fine.

00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:28.910
Mr. Oh is a little scary when he's mad.

00:24:30.670 --> 00:24:32.410
(Police)

00:24:33.080 --> 00:24:34.810
- Mom!
- Tae Pyung!

00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.680
- Tae Pyung!
- Are you okay?

00:24:37.950 --> 00:24:40.620
- What took you so long?
- Your face...

00:24:41.180 --> 00:24:43.350
The whole family showed up.

00:24:43.350 --> 00:24:44.490
Unbelievable.

00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:45.860
That woman... I swear!

00:24:53.630 --> 00:24:56.070
Jun Ho. How was your first day?

00:24:56.130 --> 00:24:58.970
- So, how's the work?
- It's the same old thing.

00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:03.140
We haven't officially opened yet,
so there's not a whole lot to do.

00:25:03.210 --> 00:25:04.370
So when's the grand opening?

00:25:04.670 --> 00:25:07.380
On opening day, yours truly will go
and give it a taste test.

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:10.050
Honey, should I go too?

00:25:10.310 --> 00:25:13.920
Gosh, why would the whole family go?
You'll just put pressure on Jun Ho.

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:15.920
- You think so?
- Yes.

00:25:15.990 --> 00:25:18.220
- Is that true, Jun Ho?
- You can come if you want.

00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.630
Since the hotel's being renovated,
I think they'll probably have a party.

00:25:21.690 --> 00:25:25.130
My university is working with them
on the new setup for the Dream Hotel.

00:25:25.200 --> 00:25:27.360
So, Dad, you'll be going
to the Dream Hotel a lot then?

00:25:27.530 --> 00:25:30.400
Yes. For now, I'm working
with the project team,

00:25:30.470 --> 00:25:32.800
but I expect I'll be meeting
with your CEO soon enough.

00:25:41.340 --> 00:25:42.350
Yes, sir.

00:25:43.110 --> 00:25:46.050
Right, okay. Mom, hang on.

00:25:46.550 --> 00:25:47.750
Okay. Yes. Right. I get it.

00:25:48.990 --> 00:25:50.250
Okay, got it.

00:26:14.240 --> 00:26:15.980
Chae Hwa Young, please...

00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:25.890
You want to know what you can do?

00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.390
You're asking me what you can do?

00:26:29.590 --> 00:26:33.230
Get out of my sight. Just disappear!
That's the only way!

00:26:33.360 --> 00:26:36.270
Die! Just disappear!

00:26:37.070 --> 00:26:40.140
- Die! Let go!
- Hwa Young, stop.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:42.340
- Let go of me!
- Hwa Young.

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:43.640
I said, let go!

00:26:44.270 --> 00:26:46.780
My baby wouldn't have died
if it weren't for this wench!

00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:48.650
You want to know what you can do?

00:26:49.250 --> 00:26:52.350
Bring my baby back to life!
Just bring my baby back!

00:26:52.850 --> 00:26:53.880
Baby?

00:26:55.350 --> 00:26:57.520
Please just spare my baby.

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:02.030
I don't care if I die. My baby...

00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:05.460
Just please spare my baby.

00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:10.900
That was definitely Jung Suk Hee's face.

00:27:12.040 --> 00:27:15.740
No matter how much time has passed,
there's no way I'd forget that face.

00:27:22.510 --> 00:27:23.750
(Oh Tae Pyung)

00:27:23.810 --> 00:27:25.350
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes, 101,
21 Migang-ro 7-gil, Seonha, Seoul)

00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.050
Once I confirm it with my own two eyes,

00:27:29.490 --> 00:27:31.150
then it will all make sense.

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:37.860
(Suk Hee's Side Dishes)

00:27:49.440 --> 00:27:50.470
Suk Hee...

00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:54.280
Be careful! Oh my.

00:27:54.340 --> 00:27:58.380
Are you okay? Here, get up.

00:27:58.550 --> 00:28:00.780
- For goodness' sake!
- Jung Suk Hee.

00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.820
- It really is Jung Suk Hee!
- Oh no, your hand! Oh my...

00:28:06.890 --> 00:28:09.890
Yes, that's right.
There's no doubt it's her.

00:28:28.210 --> 00:28:29.750
(The First Man)

00:28:29.810 --> 00:28:32.980
Jung Suk Hee is alive.
So you go and confirm it for yourself.

00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:34.480
Find out what happened.

00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:36.290
We've got a customer!

00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:38.890
Didn't you say you have a friend
who's a lawyer?

00:28:39.190 --> 00:28:42.530
Hello. I was hoping I could ask you
a few questions.

00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:44.360
That voice sounds really familiar.

00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:46.700
What am I going to do
if she gets her memory back?

00:28:47.060 --> 00:28:48.500
And the other twin from back then...

00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:49.970
What if that child is still alive too?
